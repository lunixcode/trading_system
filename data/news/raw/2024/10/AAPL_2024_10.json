        "title": "Apple sees record revenues on strong iPhone sales",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) reported record quarterly revenues buoyed by strong iPhone sales in its fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant saw $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, up 6% from $89.5 billion in the same quarter a year ago, the company reported Thursday. That surpassed Wall Street’s projected $94.46 billion in revenue, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS).\n\nOf those sales, $46.22 billion came from the iPhone. That’s up 6% from $43.81 billion a year prior, and a sign that excitement for the iPhone 16 may be better than earlier reports had indicated. Net sales were up to $94.3 billion, thanks to stronger performance from the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services.\n\nNet income for the quarter came in at $14.74 billion, or $0.97 per share, down from from $22.96 billion last year. That fell far short of analysts’ expected $24.24 billion in net income, or earnings per share of $1.60. Profits took a hit from a one-time charge of $10.2 billion related to an Irish tax case it settled with European regulators last month.\n\nShares of Apple were down 1.33% in after hours trading Thursday.\n\nApple officially rolled out its new artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, for users with the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 early this week. The company first unveiled its latest slate of iPhones and Apple Intelligence at its annual event in early September.\n\nIn a call with analysts Thursday, Apple chief Tim Cook said Apple Intelligence “marks the beginning of a new chapter” for the company’s innovation. New features will roll out in December, including ChatGPT integration, Cook said.\n\n“AI could not be a more relevant topic for Apple this quarter as they just publicly released Apple Intelligence to the world on Monday,” said Christophe Ponsart, partner in the applied AI practice at consulting firm Qvest.US. “Timing is everything and a release prior to quarter end helps to gain investor confidence on Apple’s ability to deliver with AI.”\n\nSince its release, however, analysts have been split on whether the new features will help drive upgrades and growth at the tech giant. While some are expecting the new AI tools to help boost iPhone sales and entice users to upgrade, analysts at Jefferies (JEF) said in a note this week that the features — which will include limited hardware capabilities and a still relatively small AI model — “are not significant enough” to power sales.\n\nSome users have also complained about long waits to download the new iOS that supports Apple Intelligence, and found the early features buggy.\n\nRead more:Apple Intelligence is here. Early users are underwhelmed\n\nBut Bank of America (BAC) researchers said in an Oct. 25 note that this cycle is “more dynamic with more material software updates that increases the value to the user.”\n\n“As visual intelligence, ChatGPT integration and broader Apple Intelligence features become more mainstream and improved over time, the value of personalization will likely become increasingly relevant,” they wrote.\n\nAhead of earnings, Apple also unveiled a series of new computer models, including an upgraded iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro featuring the M4 family of chips and Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Intelligence is here. Early users are underwhelmed",
        "content": "Michael Hunter, an Atlanta-based real estate marketing professional and Apple (AAPL) power user, has watched Apple’s new Apple Intelligence features evolve from promising to problematic. After a month with iOS 18.1's early release through his developer account, Hunter was impressed by the system’s enhanced Siri capabilities and responsiveness.\n\nBut his enthusiasm dimmed after updating to iOS 18.2 beta last week.\n\n“This has to be the buggiest rollout that Apple has ever done,” said Hunter, who uses Siri across his collection of 20 Apple devices.\n\nThe latest version has proven unstable, with voice responses frequently defaulting to screen text and basic Siri functions becoming unreliable. “They took away Siri from me and ruined my day-to-day use,” Hunter said.\n\nApple began rolling out its Intelligence features to regular iPhone users this week, marking its biggest push yet into consumer AI as it races to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s (GOOGL) Gemini. The update represents a crucial moment for Apple, which has bet that by integrating AI more deeply into iOS while maintaining its privacy-first approach, it can catch up to competitors who got an earlier start in the AI race.\n\nBut the response so far has been muted, with users facing long waitlists only to find capabilities that feel familiar after two years of similar features from competitors. And it’s raising questions about whether Apple’s characteristically late but polished entrance into AI can still excite consumers.\n\nPotential users (only those with the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16) eager to try Apple Intelligence are finding themselves in an unusual position: waiting in line for a software update. After downloading iOS 18.1, users must toggle a switch in Settings and then join a waitlist that can last several hours.\n\nThe reason for the delay isn’t entirely clear. One Apple watcher has speculated it’s either due to the need to enroll each user in Private Cloud Compute, where sophisticated AI requests are processed on privacy-focused hardware, or simply because Apple is deliberately pacing the rollout of these beta features. Either way, the wait adds another layer of friction to a launch that’s already testing users’ patience.\n\nOnce through the waitlist, Apple Intelligence adds several AI-powered features to everyday iPhone tasks. Messages and notifications now come with quick AI summaries right on the lock screen. The Photos app gains an eraser tool that can remove unwanted objects and automatically fill in the background.\n\nA new writing assistant can proofread and restyle text in various tones, from friendly to professional. And Siri has been upgraded to better understand natural, messy speech patterns – even handling corrections mid-sentence when users stumble over their words.\n\nBut these features, while polished, arrive as familiar territory in 2024. Sources told Bloomberg that internal research at Apple found ChatGPT to be 25% more accurate than Siri and capable of answering 30% more questions. Some within Apple believe their generative AI technology lags more than two years behind industry leaders, Bloomberg reports — a stark admission for a company known for setting technology trends rather than following them.\n\nApple executives frame this measured pace as intentional.\n\n“This is a many-year, honestly, even decades-long arc of this technology playing out, and so we’re going to do it responsibly,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software, told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIt’s a familiar playbook for Apple: Enter late but with polish, emphasizing privacy and integration over speed to market. But in an AI race where competitors are shipping new features weekly, this slow-and-steady approach faces unprecedented pressure to prove itself.\n\nApple’s AI push comes at a crucial moment for iPhone sales. Despite positioning the iPhone 15 Pro as its first AI-ready device, Apple is now cutting orders for about 10 million baseline iPhones through early 2025, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. While premium models remain unaffected, Kuo notably doesn’t expect Apple’s new AI features to boost overall iPhone sales, suggesting the company’s late entry into consumer AI might not provide the market lift it needs.\n\nStill, Wall Street remains bullish on Apple’s AI ambitions, with Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, predicting the company will reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025.\n\n“Apple Intelligence is the beginning of an AI Revolution at Apple,” Ives said.\n\nWith Apple set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, Ives sees iOS 18.1 as just the opening move in a broader transformation that will “unlock a multiyear supercycle.” With an estimated 20% of the world’s population eventually accessing AI through Apple devices, Ives said December’s iOS 18.2 features will be key to maintaining that momentum.\n\nBut early access to those features isn’t inspiring confidence for everyone. For Hunter, who doesn’t use ChatGPT or other AI tools, Apple Intelligence was supposed to be a game changer — and it just hasn’t lived up to his expectations.\n\n“I thought it was going to be my actual assistant,” he said. “I was expecting a little bit more.”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares of Apple (AAPL) closed down 2.16% on Wednesday after a report that the iPhone maker cut orders for its latest version by millions of units.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the tech giant cut iPhone 16 orders by around 10 million units for the fourth quarter of this year into the first half of 2025. Most of the cuts were for non-Pro models, Kuo said, but an estimate for iPhone 16 production is now down to 84 million units for the second half of the year, compared to the previous estimate of 88 million.\n\nTotal iPhone production estimates for the fourth quarter and the first and second half of next year are all down year-over-year, Kuo said, to 80 million, 45 million, and 39 million units, respectively. Previous estimates were 84 million, 48 million, and 41 million, respectively.\n\niPhone revenue for Apple’s fourth quarter “may not fully reflect the impact of production cuts, as the gap between production and sell-through in 4Q23 was larger than in 4Q24, and the product mix in 4Q24 is more favorable (with increased production of the Pro Max model for Sep-Oct),” Kuo said.\n\nBut iPhone revenues will likely “come under pressure” in the first half of next year, Kuo said, because of the year-over-year decline in shipments, and “less favorable product mix” after Apple launches the iPhone SE4. Mass production of the iPhone SE4 will start in December, Kuo said, and production is expected to be 8.6 million units between then and the first half of next year.\n\nApple also released a new preview of its highly anticipated AI features and ChatGPT integration in the developer beta on Wednesday. Its Apple Intelligence features are expected to be released next week through the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2 and macOS Sequoia 15.2 software updates.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nChipmaker Nvidia closed at a record high on Monday, up more than 4% to hit $143.71.\n\nThis latest advance in share price comes as Wall Street analysts held firm on their bullish outlook on the company.\n\nBank of America (BAC) raised its price target on Nvidia from $165 to $190 per share, citing strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as UK government borrows £16.6bn in September\n\nInvestment research firm CFRA also raised its price target for Nvidia last week from $139 to $160. Overall, analysts see shares rising to $148.37 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Hopes are high that the market leader in AI hardware will shine in next month’s third quarter report shrugging off weakness seen in other areas of the semiconductor world.\"\n\nNvidia is set to report its third-quarter results on 20 November.\n\nThe rise in Nvidia shares have given it a market capitalisation of $3.53tn (£2.72tn), keeping it behind Apple (AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nTech giant Apple also ended Monday's session at a fresh record high, rising 1.5% to close at $236.48.\n\nShares are up nearly 23% year-to-date, giving the company a market valuation of $3.59tn.\n\nApple hit an intraday last week, also on the back of Wall Street analysts issuing bullish outlooks on the stock. Analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS), Bernstein, and Evercore ISI have reiterated their buy ratings on Apple.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check, 22 October\n\nMeanwhile, positive preliminary iPhone shipment data posted by International Data Corporation (IDC) showed strong demand for Apple's previous smartphone models. Sales were also helped by Apple's rollout of the latest iPhone 16 model.\n\nThat came following concerns over weak demand for the iPhone 16, which had slightly dampened investor enthusiasm around the stock more recently.\n\nApple is set to report earnings on 31 October and Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg expect earnings to rise 9% from last year to $1.59 per share.\n\nSAP (SAP.DE)\n\nShares in German software firm SAP were up nearly 4% in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning, after the company raised its full-year outlook following strong third-quarter results.\n\nSAP reported a 9% rise in total revenue for the third quarter to €8.5bn (£7.1bn) and cloud revenue up by a quarter to €4.4bn.\n\nThe software giant also posted a 29% rise in operating profit to €2.2bn, with earnings per share up 15% to €1.25.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAs a result, SAP CEO Christian Klein said the company \"confidently\" raising its outlook for 2024.\n\nHe said: \"Cloud revenue growth developed remarkably well in the quarter, especially for our cloud ERP suite. Even more importantly, we are making strong progress on business AI with groundbreaking innovations such as SAP Knowledge Graph. A significant part of our cloud deals in Q3 included AI use cases.\"\n\nSAP said it now expected cloud and software revenue of between €29.5bn and €29.8bn, up from a previous range of €29bn to €29.5bn. The company also lifted its operating profit guidance to between €7.8bn and €8bn, up from €7.6bn to €7.9bn.\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nNew HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery, unveiled an overhaul of the bank's structure on Tuesday, dividing the bank into four businesses.\n\nHSBC will operate through four businesses from 1 January: Hong Kong, UK, corporate and institutional banking, as well as international wealth and premier banking.\n\nIn an announcement outlining the changes, HSBC said this was aimed at reducing the \"duplication of processes and decision making\" in the business.\n\nElhedery said: \"The new structure will result in a simpler, more dynamic, and agile organisation as we focus on executing against our strategic priorities, which remain unchanged.\"\n\nRead more: UK borrowing for September was third highest on record in blow for Rachel Reeves\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said Elhedery's \"actions are akin to getting the house in order, clearing away clutter and putting things in the right place, before embarking on a new paint job and then thinking about expanding sideways or upwards\".\n\n“It feels as if Elhedery is focusing on what the bank does best,\" he said. \"By combining the commercial and institutional banking operation, HSBC can bring together teams and strengthen the focus on a key target market.\"\n\nIn addition, HSBC announced that it appointed Pam Kaur as group chief financial officer (CFO). Kaur, who joined HSBC in 2013 and is currently group chief risk and compliance officer, is the first woman to hold the role of CFO in the bank's 159-year history.\n\nHSBC shares were flat following the release of these updates on Tuesday morning.\n\nMulberry Group (MUL.L)\n\nLuxury handbag maker Mulberry rejected the increased takeover offer of £111m from Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, calling it \"untenable\" in an update on Tuesday.\n\nMulberry said its board of directors had considered the revised offer from Fraser Group, as well as the \"clear position\" of its majority shareholder Challice Limited, in which it stated it would sell its stake to Frasers or support the offer.\n\nInstead, Mulberry said that the board believed the company \"should focus its attention on driving the commercial performance of the business\".\n\nRead more:The best stocks to buy in the UK, according to Barclays\n\nHowever, the board said that it acknowledged that Frasers, \"through its participation in the company's recent fundraising, has shown itself to be supportive of maintaining the value of the Mulberry brand. The board appreciates this and looks forward to further interactions with Frasers in the future.\"\n\nMould said: “Frasers was never going to win the takeover battle for Mulberry with a bigger shareholder blocking its way.\n\n“The debate now shifts to whether Frasers will keep its stake in the business or whether it will push for Challice to buy it out and take the business private,\" he said. \"There seems little point in Mulberry remaining a listed company if Frasers loses interest after the bid.\"\n\nMulberry shares were trading more than 3% in the red following the news on Tuesday morning.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Qualcomm’s (QCOM) new chip could help drive competition between Android and Apple’s (AAPL) iOS.\n\nThe company debuted its Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform with a new, second-generation Oryon CPU that it called the “[f]astest mobile CPU in the world,” during its Snapdragon Summit on Monday. The new Snapdragon platform can support multimodal generative artificial intelligence features, Qualcomm said.\n\nThe new Oryon CPU is 45% faster and 44% more power efficient, according to Qualcomm, which mostly designs chips for mobile devices with the Android operating system. The new Snapdragon 8 platform could help smartphone companies compete with Apple on the AI frontier, as the iPhone maker rolls out its Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple also has a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-4o into the new iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\n\nMeanwhile, Qualcomm is reportedly interested in taking over Intel (INTC) in a deal that could be worth $90 billion, the Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reported in September. Alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management (APO) had also offered an equity-like investment in Intel that could be worth as much as $5 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nQualcomm could wait until after the U.S. presidential election next month to decide on buying Intel, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The people told Bloomberg that Qualcomm wants to see who will win the election before deciding on the deal due to the potential impacts on antitrust and tensions with China.\n\nBy taking over Intel, Qualcomm could potentially scale, gain leadership in the market for mobile, PC, and server core processor units, or CPUs, and have access to Intel’s sprawling chip fabrication plants, analysts at Bank of America Global Research (BAC) said in a note. They added that combining Qualcomm’s chip revenue of $33 billion with Intel’s $52 billion revenue would make Qualcomm the largest semiconductor company in the world.\n\nHowever, the analysts said regulatory and financial challenges from a potential deal would outweigh those benefits. They are skeptical of a proposed takeover, and believe confusion over the deal could end up benefitting Intel’s rivals.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. The Arrived Homes investment platform has created an Income Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nWhile NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are “the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party,” Ives wrote, listing Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW), Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR), Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) among the companies making significant moves in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe analyst expressed optimism about the technology sector’s near-term prospects, stating, “We believe the next phase of the AI Revolution has begun.” He expects this momentum, combined with strengthening enterprise spending and a recovery in digital advertising, to push technology stocks higher through the end of the year.\n\nThis expanding AI landscape indicates a broader range of investment opportunities beyond the few companies that initially dominated the AI narrative earlier in the year, according to Ives.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft are the core drivers of AI, now we are seeing many other tech stalwarts join the AI Party including Oracle, SAP, ServiceNow, Palantir, Salesforce, Dell, IBM, Apple, and AMD among others 🔥🏆🐂🍿 https://t.co/kfpqGZYmYu\n\n— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) October 20, 2024\n\nSee Also:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: The anticipation of a strong third quarter for tech firms aligns with recent trends in the industry. Nvidia remains a top pick within the AI sector, with analysts labeling it a “generational opportunity” due to its dominant market position in AI chips.\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd.‘s (NYSE:TSM) recent earnings, which exceeded expectations due to strong demand for AI chips, further supporting the bullish outlook for tech companies.\n\nAdditionally, the third quarter earnings preview suggests that the tech sector is poised to outperform, while other sectors like energy may face challenges.\n\nThis optimism is further supported by increased ad spending, as seen with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), where analysts have raised price targets ahead of its earnings report, driven by strong ad spending.\n\nLock In High Rates Now With A Short-Term Commitment\n\nLeaving your cash where it is earning nothing is like wasting money. There are ways you can take advantage of the current high interest rate environment through private market real estate investments.\n\nEquityMultiple's Basecamp Alpine Notes is the perfect solution for first-time investors.

        "title": "Qualcomm reveals AI smartphone chip as industry leans into AI phones",
        "content": "The smartphone industry is banking on AI to reaccelerate device sales after years of slowing growth. But to do that, it’ll have to give consumers a reason to pony up for new phones more often.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is aiming for its latest smartphone chips to do just that, adding a number of new on-board AI capabilities it says will allow you to do things like virtually adjust the lighting in your video calls in real-time and allow your device to recognize real-world objects without having to access the web.\n\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s latest top-of-the-line mobile processor and includes improved performance and power efficiency thanks to the company’s use of what it calls Prime Cores, which are designed for high-end applications, and Performance Cores, for more casual tasks.\n\nQualcomm says the chips will make their way into smartphones from companies including Samsung, Xiaomi, ASUS, OnePlus, Honor, Oppo, and more in the coming weeks.\n\nThe chip maker is promising some big performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite, saying its central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), should save 45% and 40% more energy than its predecessor the Snapdragon 8 Gen. 3, which Samsung used in its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones.\n\nBut the chip’s biggest features are its ability to power onboard AI functions. Qualcomm says the chip will allow for things like erasing unwanted objects in videos, rather than just photos, without having to upload your movie to the cloud for processing. Instead, your phone will be able to simply remove that person who walked into the background of your shot. President and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano Amon delivers his keynote speech at Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 3, 2024. (Photo by I-Hwa CHENG / AFP) (Photo by I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nThe company also says OEM partners can use the NPU to expand photos beyond their borders by, for instance, increasing the background of a shot, and use the camera to interact with the world around you. For instance, you’ll be able to point your phone at an object and ask the onboard voice assistant about objects in your shot, without the need to connect to the web.\n\nQualcomm unveiled its first-generation Snapdragon X Elite in late 2023, and Microsoft (MSFT) eventually chose the processors for its Surface line of laptops and processors, debuting the new PCs in May this year.\n\nOnboard AI is the major common denominator between the two generations of chips. Qualcomm is working to ensure that users don’t need an internet connection to use generative AI apps and services, which could prove to be a major differentiator for new smartphones and PCs versus their predecessors.\n\nBoth the PC and smartphone industries believe AI will be the next big feature to get consumers to upgrade their devices to newer systems in the coming months and years. Still, outfitting devices with the ability to run AI apps isn’t going to get the vast majority of customers interested in spending a few hundred dollars on a new laptop or smartphone. The only thing that will do that are intriguing new apps that take advantage of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, more intelligent digital assistants are helpful, and improving photo and video capabilities is impressive, but there’s still no single killer app or app category that’s got people talking about wanting an AI device. My own friends and family are certainly interested in the marketing around AI products, but none of them, outside of a few early adopters and people who need the latest and greatest devices, are interested in paying up for AI just yet.\n\nThat said, it’s still early in the consumer AI lifecycle, meaning there’s plenty of time for a slick new app that takes advantage of AI to come along. And when it does, we’ll finally get a sense of the appetite for AI-powered hardware. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Apple Holds Back iPad 11 Launch to Gear Up for AI Revolution",
        "content": "MacRumors recently reported that Apple(AAPL, Financial) has decided not to release the much-awaited iPad 11 in 2024 in a strategic management move. This decision appears to stem from difficulties with interacting with Apple Intelligence, the company's novel generative AI technology that requires a device utilizing an A-series or M-series hardware or better, with a powerful Neural Engine and at least 8GB RAM.\n\nThe current iPad 10, in particular, is a perfect example that can be bought for a relatively low $299 for the Wi-Fi-only model with 64 GB storage; this iPad has an A14 Bionic chip coupled with only 4 GB of RAM, which means that it can by no means have Apple Intelligence. Not even the latest iPad mini 6 with the A15 Bionic chip and the same amount of RAM as the supposed iPad 10 has been omitted due to outdated components.\n\nThis may be due to the criticism iPhone 15 and 15 Plus users had given in when they were unhappy to find out that they bought quite expensive devices barely a year ago that would not be able to support the new AI features. Seeing how the company is still in the process of implementing the first applications of generative AI, it only makes sense that Apple is wary of causing any more disconnection with audiences.\n\nMarket analysts believe that Apple could have used the time to refine the physical internal mechanics of iPad 11 and, in a similar vein, beef up the hardware specifications of the device in the same way they have done the iPad mini 7, recently introducing an A17 Pro chip and 8GB RAM. This delay could not only help Apple gain the degree of flexibility that might allow it to tweak its pricing tactics but could also help to ensure that its next-generation iPad is ready to unlock generative AI's full potential.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) is poised to challenge Apple's (AAPL, Financial) market position as its market capitalization reached an impressive $3.4 trillion, following $3.5 trillion, a figure currently held by Apple. This surge of Nvidia towards a $3.5 trillion market cap is supported by significant investments in Nvidia's AI-centric GPUs by major tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) and Amazon (AMZN, Financial). Recent financial results also show the demand growth for the company's AI chips, including its latest products that are pivotal in AI computing and architecture. Since deep learning has become more and more significant in the artificiafirm's intelligence sphere, Nvidia has had stable growth and can be considered to be a competitor to Apple, becoming the most valuable company in the world. Based on these factors, Nvidia is in a strategic place in the AI hardware business, with good growth and solid financials. This stock could forcefully take on the leadership position of Apple as the most valuable company.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nThis competitive advantage is further strengthened by Nvidia's engagement as a forward-thinking company in the next generation of AI innovation, complemented by increased research and development spending in advanced machine learning tech and improving data center solutions. This is coupled with the company's focus on sustainability and ethical ways of using artificial intelligence, which is a trend internationally. This primary source shows how the company's context of market dynamics today and how its strategic adaptation to the future demands of such markets not only strengthens its market position but also positions it as the primary driver of the future of technology.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook doesn’t seem to be too worried about the iPhone maker’s late start on artificial intelligence.\n\n“Not first, but best,” Cook — and other executives — told the Wall Street Journal about Apple’s AI strategy in an interview published Sunday.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant unveiled its AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, this past June. While OpenAI launched its popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022 — followed by Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta’s (META) flurry of chatbots, custom AI chips, and AI software features — Apple stayed quiet.\n\nBut according to Cook, who has been at Apple’s helm since 2011 after Steve Jobs resigned, the company was looking to perfect its suite of AI tools — rather than win a mad dash to a not-yet-existent finish line.\n\n“We’re perfectly fine with not being first,” he told the Wall Street Journal. “As it turns out, it takes a while to get it really great. It takes a lot of iteration. It takes worrying about every detail. Sometimes, it takes a little longer to do that.\n\n“We would rather come out with that kind of product and that kind of contribution to people versus running to get something out first. If we can do both, that’s fantastic. But if we can only do one, there’s no doubt around here. If you talk to 100 people, 100 of them would tell you: It’s about being the best.”\n\nBut even the rollout of Apple Intelligence has faced delays: It didn’t come pre-installed to the new iPhone 16 lineup, as new software usually does, but is instead going to be introduced as a software update later this month. \r\n\r\nApple Intelligence includes a slate of new features for iPhone 15 Pro models and higher, including the ability to understand and create images and language; edit, change tone, and proofread text; and create new emojis using a typed description. Voice assistant Siri will also become more natural, relevant, and personalized and will allow users to access ChatGPT directly from their devices.\n\nWhile analysts have hoped the new features would drive a so-called upgrade “supercycle,” Jefferies (JEF) analysts warned in a note Sunday that they likely won’t significantly boost iPhone sales this quarter.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian government's purchases of iPhones for January through September were four times higher than the same period in 2023, the Vedomosti daily reported on Monday, despite certain officials being banned from using Apple devices.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said in June 2023 that it had uncovered an American espionage operation that compromised thousands of iPhones using sophisticated surveillance software, an allegation Apple denied.\n\nThe Kommersant newspaper last year reported that the Kremlin had told officials involved in preparations for Russia's 2024 presidential election to stop using iPhones because of concerns the devices are vulnerable to Western intelligence agencies.\n\nVedomosti, citing an unnamed representative of the Tenderplan trading platform, said the value of contracts involving iPhones for the first three quarters of the year amounted to 6.9 million roubles ($71,469), up from 1.6 million roubles the year before.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the data. Russia's digital ministry last year banned employees from using iPhones and iPads for work emails and applications. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe latest iPhone 16 is on sale and in high demand in Russia, despite Apple halting exports to Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nUnfazed by higher prices and using so-called grey or parallel imports that Russia legalised to enable the import of goods without the brand owners' permission, Russians have been keen to get their hands on Apple's devices.\n\n($1 = 96.5455 roubles)\n\n(Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Alexander Marrow)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Intelligence won't boost iPhone sales, analysts say",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is expected to introduce its much hyped artificial intelligence features next week, but analysts aren’t expecting the rollout to turbocharge lagging demand for its latest lineup of iPhones.\n\nApple Intelligence, as the suite of features are known, are the Cupertino, California-based company’s first and highly-anticipated foray into AI. But a delayed rollout and a global slowdown in smartphone sales for the quarter put a damper on hopes that the iPhone maker could see an uptick in upgrades.\n\nThe tech giant could add Apple Intelligence to iPhones — specifically iPhone 15 Pro models or newer — on Oct. 28, in a software update that will give users their first look at what Apple’s version of AI will be capable of. But Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) warned in a research note published Sunday that this likely won’t give iPhone sales a boost.\n\nRead more: Apple is losing to Huawei in China. Here’s why\n\nJefferies said the upgrades, which will include limited hardware capabilities and a relatively small AI model, “are not significant enough” to improve iPhone sales.\n\nThe research firm expects an incremental rollout of Apple Intelligence features in subsequent software updates over the next six months, with a big step up in AI capabilities on the iPhone likely not on the horizon until 2026.\n\nSales for the new slate of iPhones largely disappointed, growing just 1% year-over-year for the current quarter, according to Jefferies’ note citing market research data from Counterpoint. That’s including the fact that iPhone 16 deliveries began two days earlier than last year.\n\nOverall, global smartphone sales rose just 2% in the quarter, down from 6% growth in the second quarter of the year. Paired with rising costs for hardware related to AI, Jefferies said it is expecting overall downward pressure on smartphone deliveries and sales to continue through the end of this year.\n\nWhile analysts initially touted the growth opportunities and the potential for an upgrade “super cycle” for Apple, recent research shows that a minority of consumers buy a new iPhone because of new features. Most only opt to upgrade their smartphones once they become obsolete, or are stolen or damaged.\n\nThe company, too, was hoping Apple Intelligence would help drive sales. It reported sales of almost $86 billion for the quarter ended June 29, up 5% from a year earlier and topping Wall Street estimates. But the company continues to face growing competition in China, including from homegrown smartphone maker Huawei, which has continued to be a drag on its sales.\n\nApple is set to report earnings on Oct. 31.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (MSFT), has compared the transformative potential of AI with the industrial revolution, as the company launched new tools designed to help businesses streamline operations.\n\nSpeaking at Microsoft's AI Tour event in London, Nadella said the goal is to “empower people to do things that they couldn’t do previously.”\n\nOne of the leading investors in AI, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot AI features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. These AI tools, known as autonomous agents, are custom-built applications that can handle specific tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic work.\n\nDuring the event, Microsoft showcased examples of how Copilot is already being used in business processes. Consultancy firm McKinsey & Company, for instance, is using Copilot to automate responses to client requests. The AI-powered tool extracts key information from emails, such as the client’s name, company, and the nature of the proposal. It then cross-references it with relevant data and forwards the details to the appropriate expert. McKinsey estimates that the tool could reduce the time partners spend managing client engagements by 30%.\n\nThese autonomous agents can be built with Microsoft’s Copilot Studio using low-code or no-code instructions, allowing users to create AI-driven workflows without requiring extensive technical expertise.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks head lower as China rate cut supports miners\n\nFor example, businesses can instruct an agent to sort and process incoming emails and specify how the AI should respond to missing or incomplete information. Employees can also oversee the AI's work to ensure accuracy and correct any errors, known as \"hallucinations.\"\n\nMicrosoft’s broader AI strategy is closely tied to its significant investments in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. The tech company envisions a future where AI-powered agents are found everywhere in the workplace, functioning autonomously or responding to user prompts. Nadella described these agents as the \"new apps for an AI-powered world.\"\n\nWilliam Hewish, UK-based Pets at Home (PETS.L) CIO, said AI has helped staff focus on more complex tasks by handling time-consuming data collection. The company’s profit protection team, for instance, uses AI to assess potential profit loss cases more efficiently, allowing them to focus on skilled analysis rather than basic information gathering.\n\nThe new software will be available for public preview next month.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe announcement comes only weeks after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff criticised Microsoft’s Copilot, likening it to the infamous Clippy assistant from the 1990s and claiming it fails to deliver meaningful value.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Boeing, Sanofi, SAP, Nokia and Tata Consumer Products\n\n“It doesn’t work,” Benioff said, adding that Salesforce’s (CRM) own AI tool, Agentforce, can handle trillions of transactions per week and offers a more impactful solution for businesses.\n\nMicrosoft, which has consistently ranked among the world’s most valuable companies, is locked in a race with Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) to become the first company to reach a $4tn market capitalisation.\n\nSince Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft’s stock price has more than doubled, driven by a shift in focus toward cloud computing, cross-platform technologies, AI, and emerging fields such as quantum computing.\n\nNadella has moved the company away from its former reliance on Windows, scrapping its failed mobile phone division and pushing into new technologies that he hopes will define the future of computing.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss.\n\nAccording to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years.\n\n“Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOne of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date.\n\nIn light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper.\n\nMoreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars.\n\n“What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Reveals Game-Changing Apple Intelligence and New iPad Mini with A17 Pro Chip, Analysts Warn of Overhyped AI Sales Expectations\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational corporation and technology company involved in the design, manufacture, and marketing of smartphones, tablets, PCs, wearables, and accessories worldwide. The company uses artificial intelligence in several ways. The launch of Siri by Apple it became the first widely used AI-enabled and natural language processing (NLP)-powered assistant.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its most important product this month, Apple Intelligence, which is a suite of software tools bringing artificial intelligence to its devices. In lieu of this, on October 15, it introduced its new iPad mini geared by the A17 Pro chip and Apple Intelligence. According to Apple’s press release, the A17 Pro is characterized by a faster CPU and GPU, a 2x faster Neural Engine than the previous-generation iPad mini, and support for Apple Intelligence.\n\n“There is no other device in the world like iPad mini, beloved for its combination of powerful performance and versatility in our most ultraportable design. iPad mini appeals to a wide range of users and has been built for Apple Intelligence, delivering intelligent new features that are powerful, personal, and private. With the powerful A17 Pro chip, faster connectivity, and support for Apple Pencil Pro, the new iPad mini delivers the full iPad experience in our most portable design at an incredible value.” -Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.\n\nOn Monday, October 7, Jefferies downgraded the company’s stock from Buy to Hold, stating expectations for the sales of the new AI-enabled iPhones are too high, and that it will take time for smartphone technology to truly support AI.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI news investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Could Buying Apple Stock Today Set You Up for Life?",
        "content": "If you bought Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock 10 years ago and held on, you'd be a pretty happy investor. Over the past decade, the stock has generated a nearly 800% return. As a result, a $50,000 investment would be worth about $450,000 today.\n\nApple is a tremendous story. The company was once on the brink of bankruptcy only to become one of the largest companies in the world. Now you may think given Apple's current size that the stock won't be able to turn in the same type of performance as it has the past decade. However, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nOne is that Apple's 10-year performance came when it was already the largest company in the world at the start of this period. Second, all of this outperformance occurred years after founder Steve Jobs had passed. With that in mind, let's look to see if an investment in Apple can set you up for life.\n\nReasons to be bullish on Apple\n\nWhile Apple is best known for its popular iPhone, the real driving force behind its business in recent years has been its service business. Powered by its app store, Apple gets a piece of nearly every dollar spent through the platform. Currently, it gets up to 30% of every sale on its platform in most regions, or 15% from smaller developers.\n\nWhile that may sound like a lot, it's similar to other distribution models. For example, Roku takes a 20% to 30% cut for streaming channels on its platform (excluding Netflix), while markups on certain goods from retailers can be quite high. However, the beauty of Apple's model is that its app store has very low overhead costs for app distribution.\n\nAs such, this leads to a very high-gross-margin business. Last quarter, its services business had 74% gross margins versus 35% gross margins for its product business. Its services segment includes other attractive high-margin businesses, such as Apple Pay, Apple Care, and cloud services, where users pay to get more storage on their devices. It is also home to Apple TV and Apple Music, which likely carry much lower margins due to content costs.\n\nApple has been able to become one of the world's most valuable companies by creating a walled-garden system over which it has a lot of control. This not only helps it create a smooth experience for users, but also a very sticky one. Once part of the Apple ecosystem, users tend to stay. As such, even as device sales have struggled recently, its high-margin service revenue has been still growing nicely, as evidenced by the 14% increase in revenue it saw last quarter.\n\nMoving forward, Apple should have a nice opportunity with artificial intelligence (AI). This likely happens in two main ways. The first is that AI should spur a hardware upgrade cycle in the coming years as consumers upgrade their iPhones to newer models to run AI applications. Second, as users buy more AI-related apps from the app store, Apple should see a nice boost to revenue and profits.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRisks of an Apple investment\n\nAn investment in Apple is not without its risks.\n\nThe company has the potential to lose out on a big chunk of high-margin revenue it was getting from Alphabet to use Google as its default search engine on its devices. Alphabet recently lost an antitrust lawsuit, and one of the government's big contentions was the agreement between the two companies.\n\nThe Google deal has been estimated to be as high as $25 billion a year from analysts at Jefferies, as Alphabet was paying Apple 36% of its search revenue that originated from Safari to be the exclusive search engine for the web browser. While that is only about 6% of Apple's revenue, it is pure margin, so it has been projected to be nearly 20% of its operating profits.\n\nThe final remedy of the Alphabet antitrust case is still unknown, but the exclusive search deal between Apple and Alphabet will likely be impacted. I wouldn't expect all of this revenue to go away. There could still be a non-exclusive revenue share deal between the two, and it is likely that most users will stick with Google Search as their default, given the alternative options. In this scenario, maybe Alphabet pays a smaller percentage, or maybe it doesn't. Meanwhile, any other search providers would also likely have to pay a percentage of their search revenue as well.\n\nApple could also opt to use an internally developed search engine and keep all the ad revenue generated from searches on its devices. While the company prefers to use Google, the internally developed option can be used if it is not getting paid enough money due to losing its exclusive deal. Apple has been rumored to have been working on a search engine for a couple of years. If true, it could, at the very least, use this as leverage when negotiating non-exclusive deals.\n\nApple also faces a regulatory risk to its App Store business as well, as companies have complained about the cut the company takes. However, the tech giant has won lawsuits in the U.S. in the past and has come up with creative ways to keep app developers from using third-party app stores in Europe, after the European Union forced it to open up its business. This included charging third-party app stores a core technology fee of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per user per year. In addition, app developers that have more than 1 million installs per year would have to pay the same fee for every new install over 1 million. That can add up to a lot of money fast.\n\nA long-term winner\n\nWhile Apple is facing some risks, the company has shown to be resourceful in the past and should be able to mitigate anything that comes it way. The stock has been a long-term winner for a reason, and I don't see that changing. Meanwhile, AI could be the next catalyst to drive the stock higher.\n\nWhile Apple's stock by itself may not set you up for life moving forward, it can still be a solid core position in your portfolio.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024.\n\nNeutral Stance Amid Uncertainties\n\nThe tech sector has been showing positive performance amid market concerns, driven by improved earnings estimates and substantial investments in artificial intelligence. Approximately 40% of operating cash flow is currently allocated to AI, raising questions about when these investments will begin to yield returns. The strong profit margins of mega-cap stocks, averaging over 23%, compared to just over 8.5% for other sectors, suggest continued capital inflows into tech companies demonstrating earnings strength. While some consolidation and growth slowdown may occur, there is confidence that investor sentiment will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nAs sentiments shift regarding major tech stocks, other profitable tech companies are maintaining positive momentum in the market. There was a conversation regarding this, covered a few days back in our article about the 10 Most Profitable NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In, where Jason Snipe, Odyssey Capital Advisors principal, discussed the tech sector’s mega-cap momentum, particularly in light of recent mega-cap stock downgrades and significant investor outflows. Here’s an excerpt from his sentiment:\n\n“…This focus on AI has contributed to some recent downgrades but also suggests continued upside potential for select names within the sector.\n\n…He acknowledged that while there may be some consolidation and a slowdown in growth, he believes that investors’ muscle memory will eventually lead to a resurgence in these stocks.\n\nSnipe’s analysis underscores the complexities facing the tech sector amid market volatility and evolving economic conditions. While challenges persist, particularly with mega-cap stocks experiencing downgrades, there are also significant opportunities driven by innovation and strong profit margins that could support continued growth in this space…”\n\nKatie Stockton, Fairlead Strategies founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on October 17 and highlighted that there’s a likelihood that the markets could move into choppier territory. Katie Stockton characterized her stance as neutral regarding the indices despite the strength of the trend and the participation of most stocks on the upside. She noted that while short-term momentum is currently positive, particularly behind major indices, there are concerns about potential problems if key players like NVIDIA falter. She highlighted that sentiment appears overly bullish or greedy, as evidenced by the Fear and Greed Index reaching an extreme level of 5%. This situation makes it challenging for the market to sustain overbought conditions, which are prevalent across various timeframes.\n\nStory continues\n\nStockton anticipates a pullback or possibly a more significant corrective phase in the fourth quarter for the S&P 500, suggesting that this could mark the beginning of a range-bound environment. She pointed to indicators such as the VIX, which has entered a new higher volatility cycle, and mentioned signs of long-term exhaustion indicated by the DeMark indicators, levels not seen collectively since late 2021. While this does not necessarily signal an impending bear market, it does enhance the likelihood of experiencing a choppier trading environment.\n\nWhen asked about the recent performance of banks and cyclical stocks compared to defensive stocks, Stockton acknowledged that while there has been a positive move from the financial sector contributing to the S&P 500’s recent gains, it is too early to conclude that this represents a breakout in relative strength for financials. She indicated that most metrics suggest financials will likely perform in line with broader market trends rather than leading them. Furthermore, she expressed concern that mega-cap sectors are poised to lose their leadership position, which could pose challenges to overall market performance.\n\nRegarding small-cap stocks, Stockton noted that while the Russell 2000 index made another attempt at an upside move, closing close to 2,300 with a 1.6% increase, long-term trends still indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500. She pointed out that there has not been a breakout in the Russell 2000, which remains stalled below resistance levels established during summer highs. Consequently, she does not see actionable opportunities in small caps at this time and anticipates neutral trading conditions for this segment.\n\nOn the topic of bonds, Stockton mentioned that Treasury yields have shown some upside momentum but backed off recently. She sees potential entry points in Treasury bond proxies like TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF), suggesting signs of short-term downside exhaustion within a broader long-term uptrend for fixed income. She believes there is an opportunity for investors to enter Treasury bond proxies now, while also expecting yields to stall without significant long-term declines.\n\nHer insights highlight her focus on maintaining balance amid prevailing uncertainties in both equity and bond markets.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo find the best American stocks, we used Insider Monkey’s proprietary database to find US stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (AAPL): Innovating Through Challenges and Opportunities\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and sells personal computers, smartphones, tablets, wearables, and various accessories and software, best known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Its focus on user experience, innovative design, and ecosystem of products and services has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nThe company’s FQ3 2024 revenue rose 4.87% as compared to the year-ago period, with services reaching a record $24.2 billion, up 14%. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, while Mac and iPad revenue grew 2% and 24%, respectively. iPhone 16 shipments are lower than last year, with shorter wait times for Pro Max models. Initial iPhone 16 series pre-orders are down 12.7%. Overall, iPhone 16 Pro models have largely met expectations but the base model and 16 Plus have not matched last year’s figures.\n\nDespite initial iPhone 16 demand concerns, the company’s stock rose 3% in two days, reaching its highest close since July, as reported this Tuesday, October 14. Analysts are optimistic about Apple Intelligence’s potential to drive a “stronger-for-longer” upgrade cycle, with price targets reaching $265. However, recently, Huawei has surpassed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the leading smartphone brand in China, driven by factors such as nationalism, economic conditions, and trade restrictions on Huawei, causing sales to decline for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIts AI tool, Apple Intelligence, could boost demand in the US market. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates raises concerns about the impact of Apple Intelligence on device upgrade cycles. Despite potential challenges related to iPhone upgrade cycles and the services business, strong brand recognition, innovative product lineup, and expanding ecosystem position the company for continued growth.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.”\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Internet of Things (IoT) Stocks to Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other IoT stocks.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a vast network connecting physical objects to the internet. Industries are embracing IoT technologies for applications like smart manufacturing and supply chain management. Enterprise IoT spending is expected to slow down in the second half of this year due to economic concerns which will affect corporate spending in general. However, corporate spending on IoT will rebound in 2025. The global market for IoT is expected to grow at a rate of 24.3% annually between 2024 and 2032. In 2032, it is expected to reach a value of $4,062.34 billion.\n\nThe rise of smart homes, buildings, and manufacturing, along with advancements in smart infrastructure, is driving significant growth in the IoT market. Moreover, smart city initiatives are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing population and expansion of cities. Consumers are adopting smart city solutions, including smart utility meters, transportation, waste management, grids, and air quality controllers.\n\nIoT adoption is also growing rapidly in other sectors, particularly healthcare. The global IoT in healthcare market is projected to expand significantly and reach $952.3 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%. IoT is a major force behind healthcare's digital transformation, revolutionizing the way medical data is collected, analyzed, and used. This is leading to better patient care, greater operational efficiencies, and innovative treatments.\n\nIoT is also seeing increased adoption in warehouse management. The global IoT warehouse management market is projected to grow from $14.8 billion in 2023 to $57.2 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 14.5% over the next decade. This growth is driven by the need for better inventory management, increased automation, and improved operational efficiency in logistics and supply chain operations.\n\nRead Also: 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy\n\nIn terms of market segmentation by technologies, WiFi, Bluetooth, and cellular IoT make up 80% of the global IoT market. Wi-Fi accounts for 31% of all IoT connections. On the other hand, Bluetooth is used by 25% of connected IoT devices, and cellular IoT, including 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE-M, and NB-IoT, accounts for nearly 21% of global IoT connections.\n\nA key trend in the IoT market for 2024 is the integration of AI technologies, including generative AI and edge AI, into IoT devices. Edge AI, in particular, is transforming the IoT landscape. By allowing IoT devices to process and store data locally, edge AI reduces lag and allows real-time responses. Incorporating AI into IoT devices within industries offers numerous benefits, including improved operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. It plays an important role in predictive maintenance and supply chain management.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe future of IoT looks promising. Businesses and investors can expect significant returns as the technology continues to evolve. Keeping this context in mind, let’s take a look at the best IoT stocks to buy now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of the 10 best IoT stocks to buy, we focused on companies that offer IoT solutions or products, including firms involved in manufacturing IoT devices and hardware. The companies have been shortlisted based on hedge fund sentiment, sourced from our database of over 900 hedge funds. The best IoT stocks have been ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding a stake in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant renowned for its innovative products. The iPhone, a well-known product by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has been central to the company's IoT strategy.\n\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shared exciting updates, including Apple Intelligence. This feature builds on years of AI and machine learning innovation and offers writing tools for self-expression, an image playground for creative image generation, and powerful tools for summarizing notifications.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a new record for June quarter revenue, reaching $85.8 billion, a 5% increase compared to the previous year. Furthermore, earnings per share grew by double digits to $1.40. The company also achieved quarterly revenue records in over two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, France, Mexico, Germany, India, the UK, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) set an all-time revenue record in services, which grew by 14%.\n\nDue to its financial strength, strong brand image, and product diversification, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has received an average rating of “Moderate Buy.”\n\nHere’s what Baron Funds said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best IoT stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Tesla, Boeing, UPS highlight earnings rush: What to know this week",
        "content": "[ADD WHAT TO WATCH VIDEO]\n\nStocks secured their sixth straight week of wins on Friday as strong earnings from Netflix (NFLX) boosted the overall tech sector. The attention now turns to other Magnificent Seven names, with EV maker Tesla (TSLA) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led markets higher, up about 1% over the past week. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) followed, each securing weekly gains of around 0.9% and 0.8% respectively.\n\nBoth the Dow Jones and S&P 500 reached all-time highs throughout the course of the week as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the rotation out of megacap tech and into other areas of the market was on display this week as Utilities (XLU) ripped higher to end the five-day period up 3.4%, followed by Real Estate (XLRE) and Financials (XLF) with gains of 3% and 2.4%, respectively. Small caps also outpaced the major indexes, with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) finishing the week up around 2%.\n\nThe market moves come as investors have enjoyed a particularly strong start to earnings season, with Big Tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) still yet to report.\n\nSo far, 79% of S&P 500 companies have delivered a positive earnings surprise for Q3, which is above the overall five-year average of 77%, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.\n\nThe earnings season party will continue this week, with reports from Tesla, Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), American Airlines (AAL), and UPS (UPS) among names set to highlight a busy calendar.\n\nOutside of earnings, investors will also be monitoring a slew of economic data, including the final reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan due Friday. The Fed Beige Book, slated for Wednesday, will provide another pulse check on current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve districts.\n\nThe housing market will also be top of mind after mortgage rates increased for the third consecutive week, with the 30-year fixed rate inching closer to 6.5%.\n\nA weekly update on jobless claims is also on the schedule, as well as activity checks from the services and manufacturing sectors.\n\nCan Tesla drive strong earnings growth?\n\nTesla is set to deliver quarterly earnings on Wednesday following the much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event that took place on Oct. 10.\n\nWall Street analysts polled by Bloomberg expect the EV giant to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 on revenue of $25.42 billion. Global deliveries, which improved sequentially for the first time this year, along with a potential tick-up in automative gross margins, should help boost profits in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, investors remain on edge when it comes to the company's future investments after last week's robotaxi unveiling fell short of expectations. Tesla's robotaxi is displayed at an unveiling event in Los Angeles, Calif., U.S. Oct. 10, 2024. (Screenshot, Tesla/Handout via REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIn a note to clients following the event, Jefferies analysts called the $30,000 driverless robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, a \"toothless taxi,\" adding that Tesla has \"ambitious targets\" with \"little evidence of feasibility.\"\n\nThe new Cybercab, designed to be fully autonomous, has no steering wheel or pedals. Production is slated to begin \"before 2027,” according to CEO Elon Musk, and will likely be a big talking point on the earnings call.\n\n\"Investors may seek details on the rollout of Tesla's sub-$30,000 vehicle,\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man wrote on Friday. \"For high-volume sales, the automaker might need to include traditional features like a steering wheel and pedals in its Cybercabs.\"\n\nTesla shares, which have seen volatile swings over the past few months, are down about 10% since the start of the year.\n\nConsumer, labor checks\n\nRetail sales for the month of September came in marginally above consensus expectations earlier last week, signaling that the US economy remains strong. But investors will have more data points to chew on, with the final reading of the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index due Friday.\n\nFor the final reading of October, sentiment is expected to tick up to 69.5 after the index's preliminary reading unexpectedly fell for the first time in three months to 68.9 in September.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan, consumers have continued to express frustration over high prices despite moderating inflation data. This had offset more optimistic views of the jobs market, which remains a critical focus point for the Federal Reserve after it slashed interest rates by 50 basis points at its last meeting.\n\nMarkets are currently pricing in another 25 basis point cut in November, but Fed officials seem split on the path forward.\n\nEarlier this week, San Francisco Federal Reserve president Mary Daly said one or two more rate cuts this year would still be a \"reasonable thing to do\" if inflation pressures continue to cool and the job market remains on solid footing.\n\n\"The work to achieve a soft landing is not fully done,\" Daly said in her speech on Tuesday. \"We are resolute to finish that job.\"\n\nBut just one day prior, Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller said the central bank needs to be more cautious when it comes to rates, saying in a speech at Stanford University, \"Data is signaling that the economy may not be slowing as much as desired.\"\n\nAnother round of jobless claims, due Thursday, will be closely scrutinized after the number of people filing for unemployment benefits fell back to earth in the week ending Oct. 12.\n\nUS jobless claims fell by 19,000 to 241,000, but economists have warned the labor market could be skewed in the near term following the aftermath of both Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in the Southeast regions, along with the labor strike at Boeing.\n\n\"Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike are starting to distort the economic data, but given the timing of those storms — with Helene making landfall September 26 and Milton on October 10 — the most significant impact on the data is still ahead of us,\" Oxford Economics wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday:\n\nEconomic data: Leading Economic Index, September (-0.3% expected, -0.2% prior)\n\nEarnings: SAP SE (SAP), Nucor Corporation (NUE), HBT Financial (HBT), Zions Bancorporation (ZION), Nucor Corporation\n\nTuesday:\n\nEconomic data: Philadelphia Fed Non-Manufacturing Index, October (-6.1 prior); Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, October (-21 prior); Richmond Fed Business Conditions (-3 prior)\n\nEarnings: General Motors (GM), 3M Company (MMM), RTX Corporation (RTX), Verizon Communications (VZ), GE Aerospace (GE), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), Philip Morris (PM), Denny's Corporation (DENN), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC), RTX Corporation (RTX), Texas Instruments (TXN), PulteGroup (PHM), Enphase Energy (ENPH)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Oct. 18 (-17.0% prior); Existing Home Sales, Sept.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among the Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds Right Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks owned by hedge funds.\n\nWall Street stocks surged this month after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its September meeting, which resulted in the first interest rate cuts in over four years. The details disclosed a ‘substantial majority’ of central bankers backing the 0.5 percentage-point cut, raising optimism among investors for further cuts ahead.\n\nThe broader market hit record highs on October 11, driven by several financial stocks reporting stronger-than-expected results during the recently concluded quarter. Another factor encouraging investors has been the downturn in US inflation, which fell to 2.4% in September and is inching toward the Federal Reserve’s goal of a two percent annual rate. This has raised hopes of a quarter-point cut in the central bank’s next meeting in November.\n\nHowever, some analysts warn against diving into stocks after interest rate cuts, citing uncertainty around the upcoming presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider in early September discussed historic patterns in US markets towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth.\n\nShe noted how the market performs well between June and August due to thinner volumes when traders are on vacation, while volatility picks up with an uptick in activity after they return to their desks in September. However, during the election year, this volatility peaks around mid-October, instead of September, according to Young Thomas.\n\nFundstrat Global Advisors’ co-founder, Tom Lee, has also cautioned investors against election-related uncertainty. Here is what he stated in an interview with CNBC late last month:\n\nThis Fed cut cycle I think is setting the stage for markets to be really strong over the next one month or next three months. But, what the stocks do between now and let’s say election day, I think is still a lot of uncertainty. And that’s the reason why I’m a little hesitant for investors to dive in.\n\nEarlier that month in the weeks leading to the interest rate cuts, Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, forecasted a 7-10% dip between September and October amid nervousness around the presidential elections. However, Lee urged investors to ‘buy the dip’, indicating that he sees the likely fall as an opportunity to buy stocks while they trade for a lower value.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Turnquist from LPL Financial also anticipates seasonal volatility in the weeks ahead but reiterated what Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes. Turnquist advises investors not to readjust their existing portfolios because seasonal volatility has short-term effects and is difficult to forecast.\n\nWith that said, let’s now shift focus to hedge fund sentiment on the stock market and discuss some of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, it is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now, with 184 hedge funds having investments in the company.\n\nOn August 1, Apple announced strong third-quarter results, generating a record revenue of $85.8 billion. This was a 5% growth from last year. Revenue from products grew 2% year-over-year to reach $61.6 billion, driven by the momentum gained from the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air. Services revenue climbed 14% to a record-high $24.2 billion. Apple’s gross margin was reported at 46.3%. EPS for the quarter stood at $1.40, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.35 per share.\n\nA significant chunk of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s overall revenue during the quarter came from iPhone sales, which totaled $39.3 billion. However, the figure was down 1% year-over-year, due to a 6.5% drop in sales in Greater China, where Apple continues to face fierce competition from local manufacturers such as Huawei. This has led to some concern among investors around the stock.\n\nAnother recent event that set the alarm bells ringing for some investors has been Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slashing its stake in Apple by half. The company’s shares dropped 5% after the announcement on August 5, but have since then recovered. Financial experts believe that Buffett’s selling spree was triggered by speculation of an impending increase in the capital gains tax, and not due to Apple’s financial performance.\n\nDespite the cuts, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be the top stock in the billionaire’s portfolio, accounting for over 30% of the total holdings. You can read more on this in our recent article, Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nWall Street analysts have a consensus on the stock’s Buy rating, and the integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple’s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\niPad sales are also surging, having risen 24% during Q3 to reach $7.2 billion. Mac revenue grew 2% year-over-year to a total of $7 billion. The overall outlook for Apple looks encouraging as we enter the backend of 2024.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most owned stocks by hedge funds right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Before Oct. 31?",
        "content": "It hasn't been an easy year for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker faced several headwinds, including an antitrust lawsuit and slower sales of its most important device in China. Still, Apple's stock performance in 2024 hasn't been terrible, not by a long shot. The company's shares are up 20% year to date, barely trailing the S&P 500. How will Apple perform through the end of the year and beyond? The company's next quarterly update on Oct. 31 might move the needle one way or another.\n\nLet's find out whether it's worth purchasing Apple's shares before that date.\n\nWill Apple Intelligence have an effect?\n\nOne reason Apple did not perform well in the first part of the year is that investors and analysts saw that it was trailing its similarly sized fellow tech leaders in the important artificial intelligence (AI) industry. However, the company has never sought to be first to market. Apple has usually found ways to put its own ingenious spin on existing products and services to attract customers. In June, the company finally announced how it would integrate AI into its business.\n\nApple announced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related services that will be available on some of its devices. These features will only be for users of selected devices, including the iPhone 15 Pro, the latest iteration of the company's smartphone, the iPhone 16, and various newer versions of some of its other famous brands. Most of these features aren't out yet. They will be released (in a somewhat limited capacity) later this month. But during Apple's next earnings update -- for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024 -- it will be interesting to see how much sales of the iPhone grew compared to the previous few periods.\n\nIn the nine months ending June 29, iPhone sales declined by 1.2% year over year to $155 billion. If they move in the right direction by a substantial margin, that might be a clue that people are buying what Apple is selling -- at least, that they're purchasing those versions of the iPhone where Apple Intelligence will be available. The company could experience a robust cycle of renewals as a result, boosting iPhone sales and overall top-line growth.\n\nIt could also attract new customers into Apple's ecosystem. The company has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices -- it hit new all-time highs across the range of its gadgets and in most geographical regions during its latest period. The growth of Apple's installed base is essential for its future, since it helps fuel revenue growth within its high-margin services segment. The more people are plugged into its ecosystem, the more money it can squeeze out of it.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple could also benefit from its upcoming quarterly update if it simply beats on revenue and earnings. If it can do that while showing that it's starting an exciting cycle of renewals thanks to Apple Intelligence and growing its installed base simultaneously, its shares will almost certainly jump.\n\nHere's an even better question\n\nIt's hard to predict what will happen. Those who buy Apple's shares now expecting them to rise on the heels of its quarterly update might or might not be disappointed. So, for those considering investing today, the better question is whether Apple can still deliver solid returns over the long run, regardless of what happens on Oct. 31. In my view, the tech giant still can.\n\nApple's most important assets are its innovative abilities and large and growing user ecosystem. The first will allow it to identify and successfully pursue new growth opportunities, while the latter grants it umpteen monetization opportunities while helping to improve its margins and bottom line over the long run. There are many other reasons why the business still has attractive long-term opportunities. Apple's brand name -- one of the world's strongest -- grants it a powerful competitive edge, and the company is a decent income pick.\n\nTrue, its forward dividend yield of 0.44% isn't impressive -- the average for the S&P 500 is 1.32%. However, the tech giant has increased its dividends by almost 113% in the past 10 years and boasts a low (perhaps too low) cash payout ratio of 14.56%. There is ample room for more dividend hikes. Between Apple's dividend and growth opportunities, there are enough reasons for long-term investors to purchase the company's shares right now. Don't put too much stock in Apple's upcoming quarterly update.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s top recruiting executive is leaving to become the chief people officer at investment firm Citadel, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking another major departure for the iPhone maker’s tumultuous human resources team.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Cities Look to AI to Flag Residents’ Trash and Recycling Mistakes One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nSjoerd Gehring, a vice president who oversaw Apple talent management, immigration, recruiting and administration of its global HR team, is joining the Miami-based hedge fund next month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the news hasn’t been shared publicly. Spokespeople for Citadel and Apple declined to comment.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple told employees that Gehring’s boss — Chief People Officer Carol Surface — is departing after just about 18 months in the job. Surface had announced Gehring’s exit internally last Thursday. At Citadel, Gehring will replace Matt Jahansouz, who left the firm last month.\n\nGehring told colleagues he was drawn to the Citadel job because he will be closer to family on the East Coast and because of a long-held desire to be a chief people officer. But people with knowledge of the matter also say that Surface’s management style — and a desire to no longer work for her — contributed to Gehring wanting to leave Apple.\n\nSurface is being replaced by Deirdre O’Brien, the company’s retail chief. O’Brien had overseen the HR duties until Surface was hired early last year and will retake that role. She is one of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s most trusted lieutenants, and employees believe that she will help bring stability back to the group, the people said.\n\nHR Upheaval\n\nOver the past several months, Apple has seen a rash of departures from its human resources organization, including multiple employees exiting its diversity and inclusion, executive recruiting and college recruiting groups. Employees say that, under Surface’s leadership, the larger team has been mired in dysfunction and that her management style sometimes came across to staffers as off-putting.\n\nApple’s head of diversity and inclusion, Barbara Whye, is leaving the iPhone maker and will be replaced by former Bank of America Corp. executive Cynthia Bowman. Whye and Surface had an adversarial relationship, some of the people said. Apple declined to comment on behalf of the two executives. Surface didn’t respond to a separate request for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn March, head of compensation Heidi Holter, who also reported to Surface, departed for ServiceNow Inc. And Eddie McLeod, a top deputy to Gehring, left for a senior HR role at Ford Motor Co. last year.\n\nThe division had a revolving door even prior to Surface joining. In 2022, HR Vice President Jennifer Waldo departed to become head of people at Ford. Before that, Apple University boss Joel Podolny, who oversaw an internal school for employees, left for a startup. In 2017, Denise Young Smith, Apple’s first head of diversity, exited after one year in the role. Her replacement, Christie Smith, left after only three years at the company.\n\nThe same year as Young Smith’s exit, the former head of talent for Apple’s retail department, Stephanie Fehr, left to become chief people officer at UnitedHealthcare.\n\nCitadel Move\n\nCitadel Chief Operating Officer Gerald Beeson informed employees about Gehring joining the company, saying that “Sjoerd will spearhead our efforts to attract top candidates from around the world and help them build extraordinary careers at Citadel matching their merit and ambition.”\n\nBeeson added that the company is “committed to hiring and developing exceptional talent,” according to the letter, which was seen by Bloomberg.\n\nFor Citadel, the Gehring hire is a coup. He was highly respected at Apple in his roughly six years at the company. Employees within Apple’s HR division say they are disappointed he won’t be Apple’s next chief people officer and that he is highly qualified for the role.\n\nPrior to his work at the iPhone maker, he “led recruiting and employee experience for Johnson & Johnson and, earlier in his career, served for a decade at Accenture, where he led its Talent Innovation Lab,” Beeson said in the Citadel memo.\n\nCitadel is known as the most profitable hedge fund and is run by billionaire Ken Griffin. While the firm is now based in Florida, Gehring will work out of the company’s New York offices.\n\n(Updates with more on Apple’s HR upheaval starting in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating—With Big Consequences BYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work Neuralink Co-Founder’s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., Oct. 18, 2024 Five years after the release of its fitness-oriented alternative to AirPods, Apple (AAPL, Financials) has discontinued its Powerbeats Pro wireless headphones.\n\nThe action precedes the planned Powerbeats Pro 2 release, which is expected to take off anytime next year. Last month, Beats by Dre dropped a teaser on X, suggesting that the next model would feature spatial and adaptive audio capabilities, noise canceling, and a heart rate monitor. It is important to mention that tech giant Apple continues innovating its audio devices, and with fresh health and sound technologies, the upcoming Powerbeats Pro 2 should expand on the popularity of its predecessor. Moreover, on the back of its AI announcements and Apple Intelligence featured in its latest iteration of iPhones, Apple stock continues moving ahead with considerable aplomb.\n\n9to5Mac said Friday, \"It's unclear why Apple didn't keep manufacturing the headphones until their successor was ready for launch.\" The Apple Store and the Beats website both will have the Powerbeats Pro removed from them.

        "title": "Trump praises Tim Cook, says Apple wouldn’t be as big under Steve Jobs",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has nothing but nice things to say about Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nIn a new interview, Trump revealed the two spoke on the phone earlier this week and said he credits Cook with the tech giant’s success.\n\n“I believe that if Tim Cook didn’t run Apple, if Steve Jobs did, it wouldn’t be nearly as successful as it is now,” Trump said, referencing the Apple founder and former CEO who died in 2011 from cancer. “I think Tim Cook’s done an amazing job. And I’m not knocking Steve Jobs.”\n\nTrump made the comments during a podcast interview with Patrick Bet-David released on Thursday. Bet-David asked Trump about his relationship with Cook, when Trump revealed the two had spoken just “two hours” prior to recording.\n\n“Then two hours ago, three hours ago, he called me,” Trump said during his interview. “He said, ‘I’d like to talk to you about something.’ ‘What?’ He said, ‘the European Union has just fined us 15 billion dollars.’ That’s a lot.”\n\nIn September a top EU court found that Apple owed Ireland back taxes worth €13 billion, or roughly $14.4 billion. Earlier this year, in March, the EU hit Apple with a $2 billion antitrust fine for allegedly throttling rivals to its streaming service Apple Music in its iOS App Store.\n\nTrump marveled at the size of the fines the EU levied against Apple, saying they were “a lot.”\n\n“I even said about Apple, can you pay that? I mean, do you have that kind—That’s a lot of money,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then drew parallels with his own legal troubles in the U.S., where he was convicted of 34 felony counts in one criminal case, while still awaiting trial in three others.\n\n“I know the feeling because I get fined, too, and fake cases. But I don’t know if his case is fake yet, but it’s a lot,” Trump said.\n\nTrump went on to detail his relationship with Cook, which he said had been productive. In 2019, when Trump was in the White House, he had implemented a series of tariffs on certain imports from China. Among the products subject to those tariffs were certain parts needed to make Apple products, which Cook had sought a waiver to avoid. Cook then met with Trump to press his case in person. The former President granted Cook the waiver upon the condition he invest in U.S. manufacturing for its Mac Pro. In reality, Apple already made the computers in Texas.\n\nCook would later gift Trump a Mac Pro made from the Texas manufacturing facility.\n\nDuring the discussions with Cook, Trump said he appreciated the Apple CEO’s personal involvement in the matter.\n\n“Most companies send in lobbyists that get paid millions and millions of dollars to talk for them,” Trump said. “And they probably say, ‘We know Trump. We can talk.’ But they don’t. For the most part, they don’t. Tim Cook called me up directly and he did it himself. [He] didn’t have to pay 10 cents. I gave him 100 percent of what he wanted because he was right.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCook's argument regarding the 2019 tariffs, according to Trump, was that they would make it too difficult for Apple to compete with Samsung because it didn’t have to import components from China.\n\nOver the years Trump has always spoken fondly of Cook. “Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump said in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive, because he calls me, and others don’t.”\n\nDuring the interview with Bet-David Trump recounted how excited he was to receive a call from Cook back in 2019. “He calls. “Could I see you, sir?” He’s the head of Apple. And I was born in Queens and I said, ‘Oh, the head of Apple wants to see me. Let’s go.’ Even though I’m President I was born in Queens and the head of Apple’s calling.”\n\nTrump’s fondness for tariffs have featured heavily on the campaign trail during his third bid for the White House. They are now part of a major policy proposal in which Trump aims to level blanket tariffs of 20% on all imported products and 60% to 100% tariffs on goods from China. Economists say the policy would be broadly inflationary and that it would raise costs for consumers.\n\nWhen reached for comment about whether a future Trump administration would intervene with the EU on behalf of Apple, Trump campaign senior advisor Brian Hughes cited support from “industry leaders like Elon Musk and David Sacks” as evidence of the strength of his economic policies. “President Trump's agenda includes economic, energy and regulatory policies that will allow the US to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Hughes said in a statement.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Judge delays order in antitrust case requiring Google to open up its app store",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Friday delayed an order requiring Google to open up its Android app store to more competition until an appeals court decides whether to block the shake-up because of legal questions surrounding a jury's verdict that branded Google as an illegal monopolist.\n\nThe delay granted during a court hearing in San Francisco comes less than two weeks after U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a decision that would have forced Google to make sweeping changes to its Play Store for Android smartphones starting Nov. 1.\n\nThe mandated changes included a provision that would have required Google to make its library of more than 2 million Android apps available to any rivals that wanted access to the inventory and also distribute the alternative options in its own Play Store.\n\nGoogle requested Donato's order be stayed until the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could examine the handling of a month-long trial that led to the December 2023 verdict, which framed the Play Store as an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and drives up consumer prices.\n\nIn Friday's hearing, Donato scoffed at the notion that Google could succeed in overturning the trial verdict. “The verdict in this case was amply supported by a mountain of evidence about Google’s anti-competitive conduct,” the judge said.\n\nBut he decided the Ninth Circuit should be given a chance to consider a postponement until a panel of judges can decide can consider Google's appeal of the 2023 trial focused on antitrust claims lodged by video game maker Epic Games.\n\nDonato said he wouldn't be surprised if the Ninth Circuit imposes an even longer delay on his ruling, “but that is for someone else to decide.”\n\nIn a statement, Google said it was pleased Donato hit the pause button while it tries to extend the delay even further. “These remedies threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience and we look forward to continuing to make our case to protect 100 million U.S. Android users, over 500,000 U.S. developers and thousands of partners who have benefited from our platforms,” Google said.\n\nEpic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's unclear how long the Ninth Circuit will take to decide on Google's request for a permanent stay of Donato's ruling while its appeals unfolds — a process that could take more than a year.\n\nIn 2021, the Ninth Circuit delayed a provision of another federal judge's order mandating that Apple allow links to alternative payment systems with apps made for the iPhone as part of another antitrust case brought by Epic.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Apple avoided being labeled an illegal monopolist in a trial involving the iPhone app store, it unsuccessfully fought the provision requiring the company to allow alternative payment links within apps. But delaying that requirement preserved Apple's exclusive control of a payment system that has generated commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on some e-commerce occurring within apps. Apple exhausted its avenue of appeals in the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.\n\nGoogle also pockets billions of dollars annually from a similar commission system within its Play Store for Android phones — a setup that is allowed to continue as long as Google can prevent Donato's ruling from taking effect.\n\nIn its arguments for delaying Donato's order, Google said it wasn't being given enough time to make the drastic changes it framed as “a Herculean task creating an unacceptable risk of safety and security failures within the Android ecosystem.”\n\nGoogle also argued the shake-up would saddle it with unreasonable costs, a contention Donato also brushed aside during Friday's hearing.\n\n“I don’t want to be glib about it, but the expense that Google might incur appears to be a drop in the bucket compared to the profits it reaps annually from the Play Store,\" Donato said.\n\nView comments",

Founded in 1901 in Seattle, the company has expanded its offerings to include a significant online presence and several smaller retail locations. Nordstrom is known for its diverse range of products, including women's apparel, shoes, men's apparel, and beauty products. With a market capitalization of $4.06 billion, Nordstrom continues to be a key player in the retail-cyclical industry. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Nordstrom Inc Holdings\n\nFinancial and Market Analysis of Nordstrom\n\nCurrently, Nordstrom's stock is priced at $24.7075, which is considered modestly overvalued based on the GF Value of $20.00. The stock has shown a significant year-to-date increase of 35.09% and an impressive gain of 9.86% since the transaction date. Despite these gains, Nordstrom's financial health shows mixed signals with a Financial Strength rank of 5/10 and a Profitability Rank of 6/10. The company's growth metrics are concerning, with a Growth Rank of 0/10, indicating potential challenges in sustaining its financial performance.\n\nImpact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio\n\nThe recent reduction in Nordstrom shares by State Street Corp has minimally impacted its vast portfolio, given the small percentage position of the stock. This strategic divestment could be indicative of the firm's portfolio rebalancing or a shift in investment focus away from retail-cyclical stocks, which may not align with their current investment objectives or market outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Analysis with Industry Peers\n\nNordstrom operates within the competitive retail-cyclical sector. Compared to its peers, Nordstrom has maintained a robust return on equity (ROE) of 35.19%, significantly higher than many competitors. However, its growth and profitability metrics lag behind industry leaders, necessitating strategic initiatives to enhance these areas.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent reduction in its stake in Nordstrom Inc reflects a strategic adjustment within its extensive portfolio. While Nordstrom continues to perform well in terms of stock price appreciation and ROE, its growth challenges highlight the need for operational enhancements. Investors and market watchers will likely keep a close eye on Nordstrom's strategies to improve its market position and financial health in the competitive retail sector.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This move not only diversifies State Street Corp's investments but also strengthens its influence in the media-diversified sector. Despite the trade's zero impact on the portfolio's overall percentage, the strategic nature of this acquisition could hint at State Street Corp's positive outlook on WLY's future performance.\n\nMarket Context and Stock Performance\n\nAt the time of the transaction, WLY was trading at $50.66, which is significantly overvalued according to the GF Value of $38.21.

WLY's strategic focus on academic and educational publishing sets it apart, providing a niche advantage. However, comparing its performance with industry standards shows that while WLY holds a strong position in certain aspects, there are areas of improvement, particularly in growth and profitability.\n\nFuture Outlook and Implications\n\nThe increased stake by State Street Corp in WLY could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's strategic direction and market potential. Looking forward, WLY's ability to innovate and adapt to the changing educational and publishing landscape will be crucial. For State Street Corp, this investment might not only yield significant returns but also enhance its portfolio's diversity and resilience against market volatility.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Long-time cash-generating king Apple AAPL has been a staple in portfolios over the years, providing investors with outsized gains. And recently, the Mag 7 member hit fresh all-time highs, reflecting considerably bullish price action.\n\nStocks making new highs tend to make even higher highs, particularly when a company’s outlook remains positive.\n\nShould investors tap into the momentum? Let’s take a closer look at how the tech titan stacks up.\n\nApple Shares Hit All-Time High\n\nFirstly, investors should be aware the company is expected to report its next set of quarterly results on October 31st after the market’s close.\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nExpectations for the above-mentioned release are overall flat from the end of July, but the recent downward revisions that hit the tape near the beginning of October are certainly more notable given their recency.\n\nModest growth is forecasted, with the current $1.54 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 5% climb year-over-year. Top line revisions have been slightly more positive, with forecasted sales of $94.5 billion 5.6% higher than the year-ago figure. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA key item to keep an eye on during the upcoming release is the company’s Services results, which have provided a nice growth tailwind over recent years and have consistently exceeded consensus expectations in recent periods.\n\nFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenue stands at $25.8 billion, 15% higher than the year-ago mark and reflecting an all-time record. Investors should also expect commentary surrounding the iPhone 16 and its AI efforts as well. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe valuation picture here is a bit rich, likely reflective of investors’ consistent growth expectations. The current forward 12-month earnings multiple works out to 30.5X, well above the 26.3X five-year median but beneath five-year highs of 36.1X.\n\nAnd the current PEG works out to 2.4X, again above the 2.2X five-year median. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘D’ for Value. While the valuation is undoubtedly a bit steep, the company’s consistent earnings growth over the years helps provide a more positive outlook.\n\nThe current forward 12-month earnings multiple reflects a 38% premium relative to the S&P 500. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd its strong cash-generating abilities have provided the flexibility to reward its shareholders nicely, currently sporting a 5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares reflect a nice opportunity for income-focused investors seeking technology exposure.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Buy Apple Shares?\n\nApple AAPL recently saw its shares touch all-time highs, reflecting bullish momentum. Given its rock-solid fundamentals paired with consistent earnings power, the stock continues to deserve a spot in any investor’s portfolio.\n\nThe valuation picture is a bit elevated here, though it’s worth noting that the stock has historically traded at higher multiples given consistently high expectations that have largely been met.\n\nAnd while the company isn’t posting the breakneck growth that it once enjoyed, Services results paired with optimism surrounding the new iPhone 16 model and AI capabilities should provide bullish tailwinds.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consumers continue to shift to the pricier models. Sales of the top-end Pro and Pro Max models gained 44% compared with last year’s equivalents.\n\n“Given the smooth production ramp-up, consistent pricing strategy, and the initial wave of upgrades by existing iPhone users, the iPhone 16 series has experienced substantial growth in the Chinese domestic market,” Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam said. “The product mix has also improved markedly.”\n\nWhile just a three-week snapshot, the data suggests Apple’s 2024 launch is faring better than last year’s. Production issues snarled the iPhone 15 family early on, which may have constrained initial sales, Lam said. Apple’s marquee device also faced a stiff challenge from Huawei Technologies Co.’s Mate 60 handset series, which won over local consumers with a made-in-China processor.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nAnother 50 bps Cut is Still Restrictive\n\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\n\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\n\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\n\nPortfolio Manager Highlights High Growth Sectors\n\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his expectations of the market.\n\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\n\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\n\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let’s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 10%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the popular company behind the iPhone, ranks third on our list of the most promising stocks according to hedge funds. The company offers a range of products including iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nThe company is leveraging artificial intelligence to offer unmatched experiences to its customers. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence by Apple backed by AI. The system is integrated into the new iPhone, iPad, and Mac.\n\nSpeaking of its biggest avenue for revenue, the iPhone generated revenue worth $39.3 billion during FQ3 2024, making up for nearly 45% of the total revenue. Over the past 10 years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has grown its revenue and net income by 8% and 10% respectively.\n\nLast month, the company launched its new iPhone 16, iOS 18 system, AirPods 4, and Apple Watch Series 10 around the world. While Apple has its bets on the new iPhone, one can say that its integrated artificial intelligence systems will play a role in boosting financial performance for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Shivansh Tiwary\n\n(Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said he received a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook over concerns about the financial penalties that have been imposed by the European Union on the iPhone maker.\n\nApple did not respond to a request seeking confirmation of the authenticity of the phone call.\n\nEuropean regulators have launched a series of investigations into Big Tech firms in recent years, with the aim of curbing their power and ensuring a level playing field for smaller rivals.\n\n\"Two hours ago, three hours ago, he (Cook) called me,\" Trump said, while speaking with podcaster Patrick Bet-David in a program that was released on Thursday. \"He said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion. ... Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion,\" Trump added, quoting his call with Cook.\n\nLast month, Apple lost a long-running court battle with the European Union, resulting in Apple's being forced to pay 13 billion euros ($14.08 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, as part of a wider crackdown. Earlier this year, the company was hit with a $2 billion EU antitrust fine for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.\n\n\"Tim, I got to get elected first. ... But I'm not going to let them take advantage of our companies. That won't be happening,\" Trump quoted himself as saying to Cook, during the nearly 90-minute podcast appearance.\n\nTrump and Democrat Kamala Harris are locked in a close race to win the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\n($1 = 0.9234 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler))\n\nView comments",

This move adjusted State Street Corp's holding to a total of 6,015,965 shares, reflecting a subtle yet strategic portfolio adjustment. The shares were traded at a price of $72.32 each, marking a notable moment in the investment firm's trading activities.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with HAS.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent investment firm known for its robust portfolio of high-value stocks, including top holdings like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). With a focus on technology and financial services sectors, the firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion. State Street Corp's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term growth and stability, leveraging a diverse array of assets to achieve financial success. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Hasbro Inc Holdings\n\nInsight into Hasbro Inc's Business Model\n\nHasbro Inc, with its stock symbol HAS, operates primarily in the consumer products and entertainment sectors. Known for iconic brands like Transformers and Nerf, Hasbro has expanded its market reach through strategic acquisitions such as EOne and Dungeons & Dragons Beyond. These moves have not only diversified Hasbro's portfolio but also strengthened its position in digital gaming and family entertainment, making it a multifaceted player in the industry.\n\nFinancial and Market Performance of Hasbro Inc\n\nAs of the latest data, Hasbro Inc boasts a market capitalization of $9.97 billion, with a current stock price of $71.52. Despite being labeled as \"Significantly Overvalued\" according to GuruFocus's GF Value of $50.02, the company shows a robust year-to-date stock price increase of 43.33%. However, Hasbro faces challenges with a profitability rank of 7/10 and a concerning growth rank of 2/10, reflecting potential areas for improvement in its financial health.\n\nImpact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio\n\nThe recent transaction represents a minor adjustment in State Street Corp's vast portfolio, with Hasbro Inc now constituting a 0.02% position.

Other significant investors, such as Gotham Asset Management, LLC, also hold substantial shares in Hasbro, indicating continued interest from major market players. This collective interest from top investors underscores the stock's relevance in the market despite its current valuation challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nFuture Outlook and Industry Position\n\nHasbro remains a key player in the travel and leisure industry, with potential growth driven by its innovative product lines and strategic market expansions. However, the industry faces dynamic challenges that could impact Hasbro's performance. Investors and market watchers will be keen on how Hasbro navigates these challenges and leverages its brand strength for future growth. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Hasbro Inc Holdings\n\nIn conclusion, State Street Corp's recent reduction in Hasbro shares is a tactical move reflecting broader portfolio management strategies.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL, Financial) is on course to roll out a new service, which may well be called Business Caller ID, sometime early next year. The service will allow users to recognize business callers easily. This will be a component of Apple Business Connect that will let companies sign up their name, logo, and department so that when callers identify them, there will be increased credibility.\n\nAccording to David Dorn, Apple's senior director of Internet Software and Services Product, it was developed to provide relevant information to businesses that will enable them to put forward the correct information to Apple users to help them engage the service and grow their business. Registered companies will have more control over how their business information is displayed across Apple services such as Maps, Messages, Siri, and Wallet to have a perfect fit in the Apple services continuum.\n\nThe service will be available to all companies without any discrimination based on their size. Companies will be able to register using a current Apple ID or obtain a new one at no cost. Given that it will be launched across over one billion Apple devices, its global base is visible, meaning that the target audience is equally diverse.\n\nBusiness Caller ID will work for calls and messages, Promotional emails, and even be connected to Apple Pay as the Visual Identity in supported markets. This unified approach should also improve the quality of the user experience, as Apple product users are likely to see a coherent business image in their various modes of communication at the beginning of the new year 2025 and beyond. It should also provide adequate safeguards against most spam and fraudulent messages.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump on Thursday said Apple (AAPL) needed a CEO like Tim Cook to be as successful as it is now, rather than Steve Jobs, the company’s founder.\n\n“I believe that if Tim Cook didn’t run Apple if Steve Jobs did, it wouldn’t be nearly as successful as it is now,” Trump said on an episode of the PBD Podcast filmed on Wednesday and released on Thursday. “I think so because I think Tim Cook has done an amazing job, and I’m not knocking Steve Jobs, but it wouldn’t have been the same.”\n\nThe kind words from the Republican presidential nominee are emblematic of the close relationship Cook fostered with Trump while he was in office. Cook frequently called Trump when he was president, sat on the administration’s Workforce Policy Advisory Board, and hosted Trump at Apple’s Austin, Texas, campus.\n\nIn 2019, after Cook managed to convince Trump to get Apple an exemption from a series of tariffs affecting Chinese imports, Cook gifted the then-president with one of the first Mac Pros built at its new U.S. facility. In an interview with Bloomberg News in June, Trump remarked that he found Cook to be “a very good businessman.”\n\n“Tim Cook calls Donald Trump directly,” Trump told reporters in August 2019. “That’s why he’s a great executive because he calls me, and others don’t.”\n\nDuring the podcast, Trump also said Cook had called to discuss the billions of dollars the European Union has fined Apple, adding that he won’t let the bloc “take advantage” of American companies if he wins the November election.\n\n“Two hours ago, three hours ago, he called me,” Trump said, before discussing the bloc’s recent actions.\n\nAn E.U. judge in September ruled that Apple must pay back almost $15 billion in unpaid taxes. In March, the bloc’s regulatory arm fined Apple almost $2 billion for abusing its dominant position its the distribution of music streaming apps like Spotify (SPOT) or its own Apple Music.\n\n“He said they’re using that to run their enterprise, meaning Europe is their enterprise. “I said, ‘That’s a lot... But Tim, I got to get elected first, but I’m not going to let them take advantage of our companies — that won’t, you know, be happening.’”\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Overview of Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction by reducing its holdings in Cabaletta Bio Inc (NASDAQ:CABA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The firm sold 1,109,678 shares at a price of $4.72 each, resulting in a remaining stake of 896,123 shares. This move reflects a strategic adjustment in State Street Corp's investment portfolio, despite the trade having a minimal immediate impact on its overall position.\n\nState Street Corp: Investment Philosophy and Profile\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with CABA.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent investment firm known for its robust investment strategies that focus primarily on long-term value creation. With a diverse portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), emphasizing a strong inclination towards the technology and financial services sectors. The firm manages an equity portfolio worth approximately $2,285.63 trillion, showcasing its significant influence in the market. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Cabaletta Bio Inc Holdings\n\nInsight into Cabaletta Bio Inc\n\nCabaletta Bio Inc specializes in engineered T cell therapies aimed at treating B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Utilizing its proprietary Chimeric AutoAntibody Receptor (CAART) technology, the company focuses on selective B cell elimination, which could potentially offer curative treatments. Despite its innovative approach, Cabaletta Bio has faced challenges reflected in its financial metrics, with a market cap of $230.563 million and a GF Score of 39/100, indicating poor future performance potential. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Cabaletta Bio Inc Holdings\n\nImpact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio\n\nThe recent reduction in CABA shares by State Street Corp has adjusted the firm's exposure to the biotechnology sector, which now stands at a 1.80% position ratio in their portfolio. This move might be indicative of the firm's strategy to reallocate resources to more promising areas or to mitigate risks associated with the volatile biotech sector.\n\nMarket Performance and Stock Analysis\n\nSince its IPO on October 25, 2019, CABA's stock has declined by 47.56%, with a significant year-to-date drop of 78.7%. These figures highlight the stock's underperformance and the challenging market conditions it faces. The stock's current price aligns with its trade price, suggesting a stable short-term market perception but an uncertain future.\n\nInvestment Rationale and Future Prospects\n\nThe decision by State Street Corp to reduce its stake in Cabaletta Bio could be driven by the stock's consistent underperformance and the firm's risk management strategy. Looking ahead, the biotechnology sector remains innovative but highly speculative. Cabaletta Bio's future depends on its clinical outcomes and ability to secure regulatory approvals, which are pivotal for its CAART technology's success.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Portfolio Analysis\n\nWhen compared to State Street Corp's other top holdings like Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, Cabaletta Bio represents a smaller, more speculative investment. This sectoral diversification is crucial for balancing potential high-reward investments against stable, high-value assets.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nState Street Corp's recent portfolio adjustment by reducing its stake in Cabaletta Bio Inc reflects a strategic move to optimize its investment spread. For investors, this transaction highlights the importance of risk assessment and potential realignment in response to market and company-specific challenges. As the market watches Cabaletta Bio's progress, the implications of such investment shifts are critical for understanding broader market dynamics and investment strategies.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Assurant Inc Holdings",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 70,573 shares in Assurant Inc (NYSE:AIZ), a prominent player in the insurance sector. This move reduced their holdings by 2.89%, bringing the total shares held to 2,372,237. The shares were traded at a price of $198.86 each. Despite this reduction, State Street Corp maintains a substantial position in Assurant, reflecting a 4.60% ownership in the company and a minor 0.02% portfolio position.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with ATI.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a globally recognized investment firm. With a vast portfolio of 4,172 stocks, the firm is a major player in the financial services and technology sectors. Their top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). State Street Corp's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging market trends and technological advancements to maximize returns. The firm's equity holdings amount to a staggering $2,285.63 trillion, underscoring its influential presence in the investment world. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Assurant Inc Holdings\n\nAssurant Inc at a Glance\n\nAssurant Inc, with its diverse range of insurance products, operates primarily through its Global Housing and Global Lifestyle segments. The company, which went public on February 5, 2004, has a market capitalization of $10.26 billion and a stock price of $198.09. Assurant is currently rated as \"Fairly Valued\" with a GF Value of $183.95 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.08. The company's profitability and growth metrics are robust, with a GF Score of 85/100, indicating a strong potential for future performance. State Street Corp's Strategic Reduction in Assurant Inc Holdings\n\nImpact of the Trade on State Street Corp's Portfolio\n\nThe recent sale of Assurant shares by State Street Corp, although minor in terms of their overall portfolio, reflects a strategic adjustment. This reduction might be indicative of risk management or portfolio rebalancing efforts, especially considering the firm's significant exposure to technology and financial services sectors.\n\nAssurant's Market Performance and Financial Health\n\nAssurant has shown a commendable year-to-date stock price increase of 16.62% and an impressive 734.06% gain since its IPO. The company's financial health is solid, with a cash to debt ratio of 0.82 and an interest coverage of 10.14. These figures reflect Assurant's ability to cover its financial obligations while continuing to grow revenue and earnings, evidenced by a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.80%.\n\nStory continues\n\nComparative Analysis with Other Major Investors\n\nOther significant investors in Assurant include Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio). State Street Corp's strategy in managing its Assurant holdings differs from these firms, which may be adopting a more bullish stance given the insurance industry's current dynamics.\n\nSector and Market Considerations\n\nState Street Corp's investment strategy is heavily influenced by its dominant sectors: technology and financial services. The insurance industry, where Assurant operates, is undergoing significant transformations with technological integration and regulatory changes. State Street Corp's adjustment in its Assurant position might be a strategic move to align with broader market trends and optimize its portfolio performance in light of these industry shifts.\n\nThis transaction underscores State Street Corp's active management approach, aiming to capitalize on market movements and sectoral shifts to deliver optimal investment returns.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "AAPL, MSFT, or GOOGL: Which Tech Company is the Better Buy this Earnings Season?",
        "content": "As earnings season approaches for big technology companies, I will compare Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) using the TipRanks Stock Comparison Tool to determine which stock is the best buy. While I hold a neutral outlook on Apple and a bullish outlook on both Microsoft and Alphabet, a closer analysis suggests that Microsoft may be the best choice heading into earnings.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nI hold a neutral stance on Apple ahead of its earnings report on Oct. 31. My skepticism is due to what I view as overly optimistic revisions from Wall Street analysts, with 21 out of 25 raising earnings per share (EPS) estimates and 21 out of 24 boosting revenue projections over the past three months. The consensus expects EPS of $1.55 (up 6% year-over-year) and revenues of $94.23 billion (up 5.3%).\n\nWhile the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, both capable of running artificial intelligence (AI), are key to Apple’s growth, initial sales of 37 million units fell 12.7% below the iPhone 15’s launch figures. The full potential of these devices, however, may not be realized until more AI features become available, delaying any AI-driven super cycle.\n\nApple’s performance in China will also be important this earnings season. Over the last nine months, Apple’s sales in China have dropped by 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in Fiscal Q3 compared to last year, reflecting a downward trend. While there was an expectation of demand recovery in Fiscal Q4 due to the iPhone 16 launch, the full impact is likely to materialize over the coming year when AI-driven updates become available.\n\nAdditionally, Apple’s Services segment should continue to post record revenues, benefiting from Apple’s ecosystem of 2.2 billion active iOS devices.\n\nIs Apple Stock a Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nI rate Apple as a Hold ahead of its earnings, though I expect near-term growth to sustain the stock’s momentum, which is trading near all-time highs. Despite this, I see few catalysts that will enable the company to surpass the upwardly revised expectations.\n\nMoreover, Apple’s options chains reflects some volatility, with an expected price swing ahead of earnings of 4.7% in either direction based on an at-the-money $230 strike price for options expiring on Nov. 1. The chart below illustrates the options chain.\n\nAt TipRanks, Apple’s Wall Street consensus is a Moderate Buy, with 23 out of 34 analysts recommending investors Buy the stock. The average price target is $248.90, suggesting potential upside of 7.99%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nI am bullish on Microsoft leading into earnings scheduled for Oct. 30. Despite beating expectations across the board with its previous financial results, that print did not positively impact MSFT stock. And, analysts have revised their projections downward for the upcoming Fiscal Q1 2025 earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the past three months, 15 of 21 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates, and all 26 have revised revenue projections for Fiscal Q1. Current expectations are for EPS of $3.10 (a 3.7% year-over-year increase) and revenues of $64.54 billion (up 14.2%).\n\nLast quarter, a major concern that hurt Microsoft was the announcement of increased infrastructure spending to meet growing demand. This spending is expected to pressure margins in the current Fiscal year. Additionally, the performance of the Intelligent Cloud segment, led by Azure, showed some moderation, with Azure growing by 22% year-over-year in the previous quarter. These revised estimates present a more tempered view, giving Microsoft an opportunity to meet or exceed expectations with its upcoming results.\n\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy?\n\nI rate Microsoft a Buy ahead of its earnings, believing that with lower expectations and more patient investors, the company’s strong cloud performance and sustained gross margins near 70% should be better appreciated. This could help the stock return to its all-time high of $468 per share reached in July of this year.\n\nHowever, the options chain below indicates significant volatility, with an expected price swing of 5.9% ahead of earnings, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, at a strike price of $412.50.\n\nAt TipRanks, Microsoft has a Strong Buy rating from Wall Street, with 26 of 29 analysts rating it a Buy and an average price target of $503.13, suggesting potential upside of 21.84%.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nI have a positive outlook for Alphabet ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Oct. 29, as Wall Street expectations seem balanced and the company may exceed conservative guidance. Analysts have made 17 upward and 18 downward EPS revisions, along with 16 upward and 13 downward revenue revisions in the past three months. The target to beat is an EPS of $1.84 (up 19% year-over-year) and revenues of $86.23 billion (up 12.4% year-over-year).\n\nWhile Alphabet’s Q2 results beat expectations, YouTube’s ad revenue of $8.66 billion fell short of the $8.93 billion consensus, contributing to the mixed revisions. Management also cautioned that operating margins could be impacted by increased depreciation, higher infrastructure costs, and the pull-forward of hardware launches.\n\nDespite concerns about losing market share in Search due to rising AI competition, Google Search showed steady growth in this year’s second quarter, with double-digit growth expected to continue. Any potential weaknesses in YouTube or Search can be offset by Google Cloud, which experienced a 29% revenue increase in Q2, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nIs GOOGL A Buy, Hold or Sell?\n\nI rate Alphabet as a Buy ahead of its earnings, as the stock has fallen nearly 13% since its Q2 report, which I believe to be somewhat of an overreaction. Alphabet appears well-positioned to deliver strong performance for the third quarter, supported by a more balanced market outlook.\n\nCompared to Apple and Microsoft, Alphabet’s options chains below shows the lowest volatility ahead of earnings. The expected price swing is 2.8% in either direction, based on the at-the-money straddle for options expiring on Nov. 1, calculated using a $165 strike price.\n\nAccording to TipRanks, Alphabet is rated a Strong Buy, with 39 analysts recommending Buy and nine recommending Hold. The average price target is $200.92, indicating potential upside of 21.48%.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile analysts are revising estimates upward for Apple, making it harder to beat expectations in a transitional quarter, softer expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet create a better outlook for earnings beats. Though I consider both MSFT and GOOGL to be Buys, I believe Microsoft is the stronger choice as its stock likely has more room to run and it could easily beat modest earnings expectations.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclaimer\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple's 3nm Push Boosts Taiwan Semi's Q3, AI Revenue Set To Triple: Analyst\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock surged after upbeat quarterly print on Thursday.\n\nThe key Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier reported third-quarter revenue of 759.69 billion New Taiwan dollar ($23.50 billion), up 39%, topping $22.4 billion-$23.2 billion guidance and the consensus estimate.\n\nThe contract chipmaker attributed the quarterly performance to robust smartphone and AI-related demand for its 3nm and 5nm technologies.\n\nAlso Read: Nokia Q3: Earnings Miss, CEO Cites Telecom Weakness And Anticipates India Demand Rebound\n\nIts gross margin is 57.8%, up from 54.3% a year ago. The operating margin grew to 47.5% from 41.7% a year ago. It expects fourth-quarter revenue of $26.1 billion-$26.9 billion, above the Street consensus of $24.86 billion.\n\nNeedham analyst Charles Shi reiterated Taiwan Semiconductor with a Buy and a $210 price target.\n\nNeedham: By node, relative to Shi’s estimates, Taiwan Semiconductor’s third-quarter print shows a much more robust performance of 3nm and a slightly weaker performance of 5nm.\n\nThe analyst noted the 3nm upside should be primarily due to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In contrast, 5nm revenue is leveling off after six consecutive quarters of strong sequential growth.\n\nThe gross margin performance, which is now back in the high 50s range, is a positive sign as Taiwan Semiconductor overcomes several cost challenges anticipated by management earlier this year, including 3nm dilution, 5nm to 3nm conversion cost, and electricity cost increases, he said.\n\nInterestingly, the company had flagged 5nm and 3nm wafer prebuild as part of the reason for the gross margin upside, Shi added.\n\nThe analyst noted that Taiwan Semiconductor raised its full-year revenue growth target from “slightly above the mid-20s” to “close to 30%” while maintaining the 10% ex-memory semiconductor growth outlook.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects to triple AI revenue this year, which will account for mid-teens percent of its total revenue.\n\nBased on management commentary, Shi estimates Taiwan Semiconductor’s AI revenue was around $4 billion in 2023 and will likely reach $13 billion in 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has guided AI to account for 20% of the total revenue by 2028, translating to ~$33 billion+ if the 15%+ total revenue CAGR continues through the next four years.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor’s reported revenue split between technology nodes suggests that the non-wafer revenue, the majority of which comes from packaging, saw a meaningful step up from $2.4 billion in the second quarter to $3.2 billion in the third quarter, a 36% increase sequentially.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis could be partially driven by Apple’s ramp that drives InFO revenue. Still, the magnitude of the sequential growth is above seasonality (~20% sequentially) and supports the rumor that Taiwan Semiconductor may have released 60%-80% more CoWoS capacity in the third quarter.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor expects 2024’s CapEx to be slightly above $30 billion, a $1 billion trim to 2024’s CapEx budget. Last quarter, it tightened the CapEx guidance range from $28 billion-$32 billion to $30 billion-$32 billion and effectively raised CapEx by about $1 billion.\n\nOn the bright side, with Taiwan Semiconductor reporting the quarterly CapEx for the first three quarters of the year to be only $6 billion per quarter, it needs to spend ~$12 billion CapEx in the fourth quarter. The magnitude of the step-up is likely driven by the initial 2nm buildout.\n\nPrice Action: TSM stock is up 11.7% at $209.41 at last check Thursday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nCitigroup Remains A Compelling Investment Opportunity: Analysts Take On Q3 Performance\n\nPhoto by wakamatsu.h via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for TSM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Jan 2022 Atlantic Equities Upgrades Neutral Overweight Oct 2021 Cowen & Co.

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, State Street Corp made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 1,255,819 shares of Wolfspeed Inc (NYSE:WOLF), a key player in the semiconductor industry. This transaction increased State Street Corp's total holdings in Wolfspeed to 6,694,555 shares, marking a substantial investment in the company. Despite the large number of shares purchased, this move did not have a significant immediate impact on State Street Corps overall portfolio, which remains diverse and robust.\n\nProfile of State Street Corp\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with WOLF.\n\nState Street Corp, headquartered at One Lincoln Street, Boston, MA, is a prominent financial services provider with a strong focus on investment management. The firm manages a vast equity portfolio valued at approximately $2,285.63 trillion, predominantly in the technology and financial services sectors. State Street Corps top holdings include major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), reflecting its strategic focus on high-growth potential markets. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Wolfspeed Inc\n\nWolfspeed Inc, trading under the symbol WOLF, specializes in the production of wide bandgap semiconductors, focusing on materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitride. These components are crucial for various applications including power supplies and wireless systems. Despite its innovative technology, Wolfspeed has faced financial challenges, as indicated by its current stock price of $16.09 and a market capitalization of $2.04 billion. The company's financial metrics suggest a cautious outlook, with a GF Value suggesting it is a possible value trap. State Street Corp's Strategic Acquisition of Wolfspeed Inc Shares\n\nAnalysis of the Trade Impact\n\nThe recent acquisition by State Street Corp represents a 23.09% increase in their holdings of Wolfspeed shares, reflecting a strategic decision despite the stock's challenging financial indicators. This move has not altered the firm's portfolio significantly in terms of percentage, maintaining a balance across various sectors and investments.\n\nMarket Performance and Investment Rationale\n\nWolfspeed's stock has experienced a significant decline of 62.79% year-to-date, yet it has seen a substantial gain of 65.88% since the transaction date. This volatility highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in the semiconductor sector. State Street Corps decision to increase its stake could be driven by the potential long-term growth in the semiconductor industry, despite the current financial instability indicated by Wolfspeeds GF Score of 58/100 and a Profitability Rank of 2/10.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroader Market Implications\n\nThis transaction aligns with broader trends in the semiconductor industry, which is seeing increased investment despite current market uncertainties. Other significant shareholders like Gotham Asset Management, LLC, and Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio) also maintain substantial positions in Wolfspeed, indicating a general market belief in the sector's recovery and growth potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nState Street Corp's recent acquisition of Wolfspeed shares highlights a calculated risk in a sector poised for future growth. While the immediate impact on State Streets portfolio is minimal, the long-term implications could be more significant, depending on how semiconductor technologies evolve and are adopted in various industries. Investors and market watchers will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Wolfspeed's performance and State Streets strategic moves going forward.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Samsung has said a broad rollout of artificial intelligence tools to its mobile devices has sparked a rise in the number of people in the UK switching to the firm from Apple’s iPhone.\n\nThe Korean phone maker began rolling out its suite of AI tools – known as Galaxy AI – in January and has brought it to a range of phones and tablets, including the last three generations of its flagship S Series phones and its two most recent, lower priced, mid-range FE handsets.\n\nIn contrast, the Apple Intelligence suite of AI tools is yet to launch on the iPhone 16 range which went on sale last month, and will also only be accessible on the top tier iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max from last year’s range, as well as only two of its most recent tablets.\n\nA Samsung UK executive said the company has seen a more than 40% rise in customers switching from Apple handsets to Samsung in the UK since it launched Galaxy AI.\n\nA beta version of the Apple tools is due to roll out this month ahead of a launch in English in December, with other languages to follow over the next year.\n\nBut users in the EU are not currently set to be able to access the tools on iPhone or iPad, as Apple remains in a standoff with the European Union over new competition rules under the Digital Markets Act.\n\nAnnika Bizon, marketing and omnichannel director for mobile at Samsung UK and Ireland, told the PA news agency: “AI should be for everyone. We don’t believe in gatekeeping it for our most premium smartphones on the market.\n\n“That’s why we are rolling it out to the broadest audience possible – bringing AI to tablets for the first time with the Tab S10 and launching the most affordable AI phone on the market with the S24 FE.\n\n“People want to see tangible upgrades when they invest in a smartphone and we are seeing more people make the switch over to Samsung.\n\n“In fact, in the UK we’ve seen a 42% increase in customers moving to us from iOS since launching Galaxy AI.”\n\nBoth companies’ suite of tools include AI-powered features to help with writing and editing text, image editing and generation, as well as recording, transcribing and summarising calls and audio.\n\nSmartphone makers have started introducing the features in response to the generative AI boom sparked by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.",

        "title": "Chip stocks rally as TSMC forecasts strong AI demand for 'many years'",
        "content": "The optimism over AI demand in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSM) blowout third quarter earnings boosted chip stocks Thursday.\n\nTSMC posted a quarterly profit of $325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.1 billion), up 54% from the prior year, surpassing Wall Street’s forecasts. The company also raised its full-year sales outlook, with revenue rising 29% in 2024 compared to last year, bumping up the prior guidance in the mid-20s.\n\nHere’s what else the company reported:\n\nAdjusted earnings per share of 12.54 New Taiwan dollars ($0.39) versus NT$11.55 ($0.36) expected and NT$8.13 ($0.25) in Q3 2023 Revenue of 759.7 billion New Taiwan dollars ($23.5 billion) versus NT$751.1 billion ($23.3 billion) expected and NT$546.7 billion ($17 billion) in Q3 2023\n\nThe positive outlook was largely driven by “extremely robust AI-related demand” cited by TSMC CEO C.C. Wei. The chip manufacturer expects AI revenue to more than triple in 2024.\n\nUS-listed TSMC shares jumped 13% on the news, pushing the company's market capitalization past the $1 trillion mark and fueling a rise in chip stocks across the board. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2.6% Thursday, while Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped 1.3% before paring gains. Qualcomm (QCOM) ticked up 1.3%, and Broadcom (AVGO) surged 2.9%.\n\nAfter underperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) earlier this week, the PHLX Semiconductor (^SOX) index gained 2% Thursday, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.13% increase.\n\nTSMC is one of three companies capable of manufacturing AI chips that have been crucial to the massive wave of AI innovation following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2022. The Taiwanese company dominates rivals Samsung (005930.KS) and Intel (INTC) in the AI semiconductor market. TSMC makes the artificial intelligence chips designed by AI superpower Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices, and those chips are used in data centers to power AI software such as ChatGPT and other popular bots. Other major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, and Broadcom.\n\nTSMC’s sunny third quarter earnings and full-year outlook are a welcome sign for angsty investors worried over the future of the AI space. Wall Street analysts have signaled concerns in recent months over the lack of a near-term return on investment for Big Tech firms spending massive sums on AI infrastructure. The worry is that tech companies could ease spending on AI hardware, causing a downturn in shares of companies like Nvidia and its supplier TSMC. The optimism over AI demand in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's blowout third quarter earnings boosted chip stocks. (REUTERS/Ann Wang/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nThose fears were on display earlier this week, when an AI equipment company’s woes prompted a rout in global chip stocks. Dutch tech giant ASML (ASME.DE) indicated in its third quarter earnings release this week that sales of its machines — which are used by TSMC to make Nvidia’s leading AI chips — would ease. Though ASML’s results were driven by geopolitical concerns and other factors unrelated to the AI chip market, easily spooked investors sold off shares of Nvidia, AMD, and AVGO, with the stocks suffering sharp declines.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC’s results helped those AI chip stocks partially recover from those losses.\n\nAnalysts, however, did put TSMC executives in the hot seat during a call Thursday, probing company leaders about whether there’s an AI bubble.\n\n“We believe the AI demand is real,” Wei responded, “and it will continue for many years.”\n\n“Almost every AI innovator is working with TSMC, and so we probably get the deepest and widest look of anyone in this industry,” he continued.\n\nThe AI chip market is set to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% next year, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Meanwhile, the semiconductor market overall is projected to grow 18% this year and 12% in 2025. IBS data shows the AI chip market — also known as the accelerator chip market — outpacing the sector at large through 2030.\n\nWall Street analysts on Thursday reiterated their Buy ratings on TSM.\n\n“[W]e recommend TSMC stock as a core holding for investors who look to invest in semiconductors, which we view as the foundation of the expanding digital economy,” Needham analyst Charles Shi wrote in a note to investors Thursday.\n\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "The Department of Justice could block Google (GOOGL) from being the default search engine on Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone as part of its antitrust victory against the tech giant.\n\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google monopolized the online search engine market. Analysts at Jefferies (JEF) said a “very likely” outcome could be that the Justice Department will opt to ban Google from paying Apple to be the exclusive search engine on the popular smartphone.\n\nThat could pose a major blow to Apple’s revenues. According to the analysts’ estimates, revenue from this deal is around $25 billion for the year, or about 6.3% of Apple’s revenue and a whopping 20% of its pretax profit.\n\nThis ban could take place over the course of several years and may not altogether prevent Google from having any revenue-sharing agreement with Apple. Instead, it would block the two tech giants from having an exclusive deal that would shut out other search engines.\n\nApple stock was flat as of Thursday morning, trading at $231.96 per share. The tech giant has a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion — the largest in the world.\n\nFederal judge Amit Mehta said in his decision that Google’s exclusive agreements with companies like Apple allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback.\n\nTo address Google’s monopoly in the search engine market, the Justice Department said in a court filing earlier this month that it’s looking for remedies that would prevent and restrain any present and future maintenance of its dominance.\n\nThis would include “behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features” — which could also mean breaking up the company.\n\nWhile the ruling and subsequent DOJ proposals have knock-on effects on the iPhone maker, Apple stock was largely unharmed by the ruling. Jefferies noted that the sales performance of the recently released iPhone 16 and rollout of its artificial intelligence features, Apple Intelligence, are more important short-term drivers.\n\nThe analysts said they are worried that market expectations for next year’s iPhone, the iPhone 17, are too high and that AI hardware tech on smartphones may have to wait until the iPhone 18 in 2026 to be fully developed.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

That never happened and the project was canned after 10 years, but now it appears some of the tech developed by Apple’s car program has found its way into cars built by another automaker.\n\nThe American tech giant wasn’t in cahoots with VW or McLaren, it wasn’t even working with its supplier Foxconn on its increasing endeavors into the automotive world. No, Apple was instead working with Chinese EV maker BYD, reports Bloomberg.\n\nThe iPhone maker reportedly worked with Chinese automaker BYD “for years,” explains Bllomberg. The two companies co-developed long-range batteries that formed the basis for the kind of cells BYD uses in its models today:\n\nApple and the Shenzhen-based company teamed up around 2017 to build a battery system using lithium iron phosphate cells, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn’t been disclosed. The technology was designed to be longer-range and safer than typical electric-vehicle batteries at the time.\n\nThough Apple doesn’t own any of the technology used in BYD’s current Blade batteries, the partnership shows just how far the iPhone maker went in its efforts to produce a car. The tech titan spent roughly $1 billion a year over the past decade on the vehicle project — often seen as one of the company’s “next big things” — before scrapping it in February.\n\nThe technology that Apple developed with BYD would have been highly customized for the once-planned vehicle, according to the people. As part of the secret partnership, Apple engineers brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, they said. BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements using lithium iron phosphate cells — better known as LFP.\n\nBYD now uses the Blade battery tech across its entire lineup of electric cars, with a spokesperson for the company telling Bloomberg that it “holds complete property rights and patent rights for the Blade battery.” BYD now uses the Blade batteries in its electric vehicles. - Photo: John Keeble (Getty Images)\n\nThe tech is set apart in the way it arranges the lithium iron phosphate cells that BYD uses in its cars, explains Autoevolution. This was Apple’s contribution to the project, the site reports, as it follows a similar method to how the tech giant stacks cells in products like its laptops:\n\nAt the time, Apple was working on several different battery technologies, using elements like nickel and alkaline. It had also invested millions of dollars into battery pack design and engineering that would allow space optimization for improved energy density. By combining BYD’s LFP tech with Apple pack design, the Cupertino company believed it could produce a safe, long-range battery system for its car project.\n\nApple reportedly backed away from the collaboration with BYD and looked across the auto industry for another battery partner to work with. The search was short-lived, however, and the tech giant canned its quest to build a car of its own earlier this year after 10 years of work on the project.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared on Jalopnik.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to new highs on a solid start to third-quarter earnings. The benchmark topped 43,000 for the first time early this week and is up 14.3% so far this year. \r\n\r\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 15% this year. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising over the past week, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, Honeywell International Inc. HON, McDonald’s MCD and Apple Inc. AAPL.\r\n\r\nThe third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start, with companies beating estimates and providing a reassuring comment on underlying economic trends. Total earnings for the 48 S&P 500 members that have reported third-quarter results so far are up 5.2% on 4.9% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.9% beating revenue estimates. This is a better beat ratio than the group of companies seen in other recent periods (read: 5 Sector ETFs to Bet on This Earnings Season).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the latest blockbuster jobs and inflation report renewed investors’ confidence in the economy's health. The jobs data showed the biggest jump in six months in September, a fall in the unemployment rate and a solid wage increase, all pointing to a resilient economy. The United States added 254,000 jobs last month, up from a revised 159,000 in August, and unemployment dipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Meanwhile, inflation cooled down to 2.4% in September, down from 2.5% recorded in August and in line with market expectations of 2.3%-2.4%. The inflation rate peaked at a 41-year high of 8.9% in June 2022.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Fed rate cut cycle benefited the stocks. Lower rates primarily benefit cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. Being highly exposed to cyclical sectors, the blue-chip index is set to outperform from this trend. Lower rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market.\n\nDIA in Focus\n\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $37 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 8.6% share. Financials (23.7%), information technology (19.2%), healthcare (17.8%), consumer discretionary (15.3%) and industrials (13.7%) are the top five sectors. \r\n\r\nSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 5 Sector ETFs to Bet on This Earnings Season).\n\nStory continues\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of DIA\n\nJPMorgan is one of the biggest global banks, with assets worth 4.14 trillion and stockholders’ equity worth $340.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. The stock has gained 5.5% in a week and makes up for 3.4% in the DIA portfolio. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.9% for this year. JPMorgan currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Goldman accounts for an 8% share in DIA’s portfolio and has a Zacks Rank #3. \r\n\r\nHoneywell International is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company, with a wide range of products and services. Its diversified portfolio of solutions serves customers globally with aerospace products and services, energy-efficient products and solutions for businesses, and process technology, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials for refining and petrochemicals. HON has risen 5% this year over the past week and makes up for 3.3% of DIA portfolio. Honeywell has an expected earnings growth rate of 10.3% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nMcDonald’s is a leading fast-food chain that currently operates more than 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. The company mainly operates and franchises quick-service restaurants (QSRs) under the McDonald’s brand. The stock has gained 3.8% over the past week and accounts for a 4.8% share in the DIA basket.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIf the summer was about the ROI on AI, or really, the absence of it, how much patience does Wall Street have for tech’s fall earnings?\n\nJudging by the surge in chip stocks, investors waiting for details about where all that infrastructure money is going and when new revenue will be coming will have to wait a while longer. An appreciating asset is its own defense.\n\nAs analysts press tech executives for clearer timelines around the supposed AI transformation, chip names continue to climb. Nvidia is once again threatening Apple as the market’s most valuable company. Semiconductor names are amassing gains, reversing a downfall from August. That reflects the intense demand for AI processing and infrastructure and a disregard for short-term worries over ballooning capex. Chasing the dream is expensive.\n\nAnd once again investors are wondering where the limit is — if it exists.\n\nThird quarter reports are primed to test those boundaries with even more money at stake. The longer the capex hose stays open and the more vehemently executives fuse their identities with the AI wave, the harder it will be to turn back. Megacap tech companies are expected to dedicate $215 billion to AI capital expenditures this year, and according to Goldman Sachs, another $250 billion in 2025.\n\nA slowdown in investment isn’t here yet. But we’ll be looking for clues on how long AI growth will last until company whims, preferences, and future spending start to reveal themselves on spreadsheets. It’s only a matter of time before the imagined productivity gains and “innovative AI use cases” come due.\n\nThe tight, symbiotic ecosystem of selling AI hardware suggests that as soon as Big Tech eases spending or pivots elsewhere, previously robust fundamentals might be destabilized.\n\nThe tech giants largely disappointed Wall Street last quarter. Only Meta came out with a clear victory. While reactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) highlighted how heavy AI investment can become a liability, Zuckerberg showed that Wall Street doesn’t mind swelling capex, as long as every other part of the business is exceeding expectations. That’s a high bar to clear. And it will only get harder as the spending side of the ledger gets bigger without surefire revenue to offset it.\n\nSeeing past risk is a virtue at the top of the corporate ladder. So is suppressing bubble chatter. If the upward trajectory of chip stocks is a bellwether then the tech giants will continue to double down on their mega disbursements. That’s what we would expect from tenacious leadership. Even if everyone else is anxious for answers.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin's Top 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks: Are They Buys Now?",
        "content": "Ken Griffin subscribes to the theory that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. His Citadel hedge fund's portfolio includes over 5,800 holdings. How has this highly diversified strategy worked out for Griffin? Quite well, considering he's currently worth roughly $43 billion.\n\nWith such a big portfolio, it's not surprising that Griffin owns positions in many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Here are his top three AI stocks -- and whether or not they're good picks to buy now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranks as the largest individual stock holding for Griffin and his third-largest holding overall (after two exchange-traded funds). As of June 30, 2024, his hedge fund owned 7.69 million shares of the e-commerce and cloud services giant worth around $1.49 billion. Griffin remains bullish about Amazon, increasing his stake in the stock by nearly 17% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nAI permeates practically every part of Amazon's business. The company uses AI to recommend products for online buyers. Its Alexa is one of the most popular AI assistants. Amazon incorporates AI into its search, boosting e-commerce sales. AI helps the company optimize its warehouse operations. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide array of AI tools to customers.\n\nSure, Amazon (like several of its peers) seemed to be initially caught off-guard by the rapid rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT. AWS also faces stiff competition from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in providing cloud services.\n\nHowever, Griffin is smart to have invested so heavily in Amazon, in my opinion. The company is a leader in AI with the resources to remain among the strongest players. Despite the challenges from Microsoft and Google Cloud, AWS remains the top cloud services provider. I think Amazon stock is still one of the best AI picks around.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) trails behind Amazon as Griffin's second-largest individual stock holding. Citadel owned 5.47 million shares of the iPhone maker worth $1.15 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This reflected aggressive buying by Griffin in Q2: He increased his hedge fund's position in Apple by 93%.\n\nI suspect that AI was a major reason why Griffin added so much to Citadel's stake in Apple. The company at long last introduced its generative AI capabilities, which it calls Apple Intelligence. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that Apple Intelligence could ignite a supercycle of iPhone upgrades that provide a big tailwind for Apple.\n\nOthers aren't so optimistic, though. They think Apple's slow rollout of its generative AI features could backfire. Even if Apple Intelligence does drive incremental growth, much of it could already be baked into Apple's share price with the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of close to 30.\n\nStory continues\n\nI agree to some extent with the skeptics who slam Apple's staggered introduction of its Apple Intelligence capabilities. My hunch is we won't see an overwhelming kick-off of an upgrade supercycle this year. However, I nonetheless expect iPhone sales will increase with momentum potentially accelerating in 2026 and 2027. Apple isn't a slam-dunk near-term pick, in my view, but it's still a stock worth buying for long-term investors.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is Griffin's third-largest AI position and ranks in Citadel's top 10 holdings overall. At the end of Q2, the hedge fund owned 4.84 million shares of the semiconductor and infrastructure software company worth $776.7 million. Griffin increased Citadel's position in Broadcom by roughly 64% in Q2.\n\nAI is a huge growth driver for Broadcom. CEO Hock Tan said in September that the company expects to generate $12 billion from AI in fiscal year 2024. That estimate reflects 23% of Broadcom's projected total full-year revenue. The company has recently launched multiple new AI infrastructure products, including ethernet networking switches designed to accelerate AI workloads.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's growth story isn't as rosy as you might think. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of VMware, the company's revenue increased by only 4% year over year in the latest quarter.\n\nBut Griffin is bullish about Broadcom. So is Wall Street, with 27 of 29 analysts surveyed by LSEG in October recommending the stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" I agree with the consensus: Broadcom is a great AI stock to buy and hold.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 788% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 170% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "Meet The Low-Cost Vanguard ETF That Has 20% Of Its Holdings in Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is surging once again, passing Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the second most valuable U.S.-based company behind Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Nvidia's new Blackwell graphics processing unit architecture could deliver significant performance improvements and cost efficiency, which would be a win for Nvidia and its customers.\n\nFolks looking to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) could simply buy Nvidia stock as a catch-all way to play a rise in computing power demand. But there are also exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to consider.\n\nWith a more than 20% stake in Nvidia, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), here's why the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) stands out as an excellent way to invest in the semiconductor industry without racking up high fees. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe tech sector has evolved\n\nThe technology sector is, by far, the largest sector in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) -- making up 31.7% of the index. One look at its top holdings and it is easy to see why.\n\nCompany Weight in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF Apple 16.2% Nvidia 14.1% Microsoft 13.9% Broadcom 4.4% Adobe 1.7% Salesforce 1.6% AMD 1.6% Oracle 1.6% Accenture 1.4% Cisco Systems 1.4%\n\nData source: Vanguard.\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom have a combined market cap of over $10.5 trillion -- making the sector very top-heavy.\n\nAnd while the tech sector used to be dominated by software and hardware companies, semiconductors are now the largest industry within the sector, making up 28.9% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nSo, while investors could turn to pure-play semiconductor funds like the iShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a better long-term investment. For starters, the iShares Semiconductor ETF has a 0.35% expense ratio compared to just 0.1% for the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical, making an ETF that focuses only on chip stocks volatile.\n\nWith the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, an investor gains access to the infrastructure and processing might that is powering AI, as well as AI-driven tools like those deployed by software companies Microsoft, Adobe, or Apple phones with AI chips.\n\nFactors to consider before buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a great way to invest in today's top tech companies. However, its greatest drawbacks are that it offers little exposure to smaller companies (given the size of the largest tech companies), and it leaves out some important names that you may think are in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Google's parent company, Alphabet, are in the communications sector. So you won't find these four names in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF.\n\nAmazon Web Services is the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure -- which is critical for running global AI models. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms has arguably been the single best example of a company investing heavily in AI (and buying a lot of Nvidia chips) and showing why those investments are paying off.\n\nVanguard offers a low-cost mega-cap growth fund that targets top growth stocks regardless of their sector. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) may be a better fit for investors who want less exposure to tech stocks and better coverage of the largest growth stocks by market cap.\n\nLet ETFs work for you\n\nNvidia has captured the spotlight as the leader in AI innovation in the semiconductor space. Still, some investors may prefer AMD as an underdog that could take market share from Nvidia over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom offers a nice blend of value, growth, and income, given its diversified business and growing dividend.\n\nThe fact that the tech sector has a 20% weighting in these three stocks alone shows how valuable these companies have become. Buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a simple way to add to your exposure to these three names and the rest of the semiconductor industry. It's also an excellent way to avoid the risks of betting on a single company to invest in AI or another trend.\n\nThe best way to approach individual stocks and ETFs is to use them to suit your interests, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Investors who closely follow the sector may prefer to build their tech portfolio around chip stocks and leave out the big software names. But folks looking for a low-cost passive approach may prefer the hands-off nature of simply buying the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and resting easy knowing it is chock-full of semiconductor stocks -- so they won't miss out if the industry continues to soar higher.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a better-than-projected 54% rise in quarterly earnings after strong sales of Nvidia Corp. AI chips offset a sagging mobile industry.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories Chicago Should Consider Furloughs, Higher Booze Tax, Watchdog Says\n\nThe main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported September-quarter net profit of NT$325.3 billion ($10.1 billion), versus an average estimate for NT$299.3 billion. That followed a previously reported 39% climb in revenue during the period.\n\nTSMC’s shares have surged more than 70% this year, outpacing many of Asia’s biggest tech firms in a reflection of outsized expectations around its AI business. Taiwan’s largest company raised its outlook for 2024 revenue in July, underscoring expectations for sustained spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Steady adoption of artificial intelligence should also help fuel sales of iPhones and other gadgets.\n\nWhile official trading of TSMC’s American depositary receipts won’t begin for a few hours, the ADRs are up about 4.5% on Robinhood’s overnight trading platform. TSMC is popular among US retail investors seeking to bet on the AI theme. Shares of Japanese chip gear makers including Lasertec Corp. pared losses in Tokyo after TSMC reported.\n\nFor a liveblog on TSMC’s earnings, click here.\n\nStill, investors will be watching for deviations in outlook after major supplier ASML Holding NV reported only half the orders analysts estimated. The chipmaking gear maker blamed slower-than-expected recovery in the automotive, mobile and PC markets, impacting expansion plans for chip plants. AI remains a bright spot, executives said.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC’s short- to medium-term revenue outlook remains solid despite the potential slowdown in global fabrication-capacity growth implied by ASML — its largest tool supplier — reporting a 3Q book at half the expected level. Strong demand for TSMC’s 2- and 3-nanometer technologies from Nvidia, AMD, Apple and Qualcomm provide an offset. TSMC’s superior production yields, improving EUV machine productivity and leadership in 2.5D and 3D packaging offer further sales support.\n\n- Charles Shum, analyst\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nEven before ASML, some investors have grown cautious about the sustainability of global AI spending. They question whether big tech firms like Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. will continue to splash out on AI chips and data centers without a truly killer AI application.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, TSMC appears to be pursuing a rapid international expansion.\n\nIt’s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That’s on top of construction underway in Japan, Arizona and Germany.\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov and Cindy Wang.\n\n(Updates with share action in the fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. worked with Chinese automaker BYD Co. for years as part of its now-canceled car project, developing long-range batteries that helped lay the groundwork for technology used today, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories\n\nApple and the Shenzhen-based company teamed up around 2017 to build a battery system using lithium iron phosphate cells, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the effort hasn’t been disclosed. The technology was designed to be longer-range and safer than typical electric-vehicle batteries at the time.\n\nThough Apple doesn’t own any of the technology used in BYD’s current Blade batteries, the partnership shows just how far the iPhone maker went in its efforts to produce a car. The tech titan spent roughly $1 billion a year over the past decade on the vehicle project — often seen as one of the company’s “next big things” — before scrapping it in February.\n\nThe technology that Apple developed with BYD would have been highly customized for the once-planned vehicle, according to the people. As part of the secret partnership, Apple engineers brought expertise in advanced battery packs and heat management, they said. BYD contributed manufacturing know-how and advancements using lithium iron phosphate cells — better known as LFP.\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and BYD declined to comment on the joint battery work. But BYD said in an emailed statement that “the concept for the Blade battery originated with BYD engineers, who independently developed this LFP Blade battery. BYD holds complete property rights and patent rights for the Blade battery.”\n\nToday, BYD’s entire car lineup is powered by the Blade system, which uses a battery pack design that people involved in its development say was informed by lessons from the Apple work.\n\nThe seeds of Apple’s BYD collaboration were planted about a decade ago, when the US company was seeking core technologies for its car. BYD engineers previewed early versions of the Blade battery to Apple executives, who admired the technology’s safety and energy storage capabilities. Apple ultimately sought customizations that could enhance the range of an EV, the people said.\n\nAt the time, Cupertino, California-based Apple had already been working on several different batteries, using elements like nickel and alkaline. It had also been investing millions of dollars in battery pack design and engineering to squeeze in as many cells as possible. The two companies sought to combine the separate pack and cell efforts to produce a safe, long-range battery system for the Apple vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the Apple side, the tie-up was led by Alexander Hitzinger, a former senior Volkswagen AG and Porsche executive who oversaw product design for the car project from 2016 to 2019. The company also had enlisted Mujeeb Ijaz, a veteran of the failed American battery startup A123 Systems LLC who worked at Apple from 2014 to 2020.\n\nIjaz oversaw a team of about 50 battery engineers working on the project. His counterpart at BYD was Michael He, vice president of the company’s battery business.\n\nThe Blade is now a signature feature in BYD cars — and a major selling point. The company used its improved range, relative safety and lower cost to generate sales of 3 million electric and hybrid vehicles in 2023, up from 179,054 three years earlier.\n\nIt’s now the biggest automaker in China by sales and briefly surpassed Tesla Inc. to become the top seller of EVs globally. BYD founder and Chairman Wang Chuanfu, a battery engineer himself, is a billionaire.\n\nDespite years of working with BYD, Apple backed away from the partnership and considered systems from other battery makers, the people said. The overall car project suffered numerous delays, and the economics of the EV business eventually proved too daunting.\n\nWhen Apple canceled the car project, it marked a rare high-profile failure for the world’s most valuable company. But the decadelong endeavor did prove useful in some ways. Beyond the battery insights gleaned from the effort, it helped with the development of products such as the Vision Pro headset and the Neural Engine AI processor now present in most Apple devices. The work also has contributed to the company’s nascent push into robotics.\n\n--With assistance from Danny Lee.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore When a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Justice Department will ‘very likely’ kill Google’s billion-dollar deal to be the default search engine on iPhones, Jefferies predicts",
        "content": "Analysts at Jeffries say it's \"very likely\" the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will ban Google's longtime search deal on iPhones, a decision Jeffries predicts could plummet Apple's stocks by as much as 11%.\n\nGoogle has been at the center of the biggest antitrust trial in decades, as the DOJ questions practices that have kept the search engine front-and-center on smartphones and web browsers. Google has paid billions to Apple and others annually to have a prominent spot on devices up until now, but Jeffries analysts on Wednesday predicted the DOJ would ban those deals in the future as it tries to break up any search monopoly. Jeffries estimates the $25 billion deal makes up 20% of Apple's pretax profit, or about 6.3% of total revenue, representing an 8-11% hit on share prices.\n\nThese deals have taken place since 2002 when Google first paid Apple a cut of its search advertising revenue to make Google the default search platform. According to The Financial Times, that gave Google access to Apple's user base, with more than half of all search queries in the U.S. today currently flowing through Apple devices.\n\nDuring the trial, DOJ lawyers argued that Google's practice of paying billions to secure its position on platforms like Apple blocks competitors and prevents innovation. Google has repeatedly countered that its dominance stems from consumer preference and users can easily switch to other search engines if they wish. However, DOJ prosecutors contend that the sheer scale of these payments reveals the lengths Google goes to maintain its monopoly.\n\nEven if the DOJ does end these deals, the effects may take time to materialize. Jefferies estimates it could take three to eight years for a final outcome in court, with the possibility of long appeals. Jeffries also called its own estimates \"pessimistic,\" noting they are part of a model in which there is zero offset in revenue by Apple. If the case is indeed tied up for years, as Jeffries predicts, Apple has plenty of time to course-correct and make up for any potential lost revenue. Jeffries also added the impact could be contained to the U.S. only, depending on the reaction from Europe to any DOJ decision.\n\nRepresentatives from Jeffries, Apple, and Google did not immediately reply to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nIn the meantime, Apple's stock price has remained relatively resilient, bolstered by investor optimism about upcoming products like the iPhone 17 as well as new AI-powered technologies.\n\nStill, should the DOJ block the Google-Apple deal, it will mark a significant shift for both companies and could force Apple to explore its own search engine or deeper AI integrations—a path that carries its own risks. For Google, the stakes are equally high, if not higher. This case could fundamentally disrupt the company’s ability to use financial agreements to dominate the search-engine market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe outcome of the case would also trigger ripple effects across the broader tech landscape, potentially opening doors for competitors such as Microsoft. As regulators across the globe keep a close eye on this case, it’s clear that both Google and Apple stand at the crossroads of a legal decision that could reshape their futures.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s chief people officer is leaving the iPhone maker after less than two years, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking an unusually short tenure for a senior executive at the company.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nInside the ‘Utopias’ of Mexico City How Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought One City’s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided Mexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure\n\nCarol Surface, who started at Apple in early 2023 and reports to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, is departing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced. Apple employees were notified of the exit on Wednesday, they said.\n\nWhen Surface joined Apple, she took over the people role from Deirdre O’Brien, who had been managing that team in addition to the company’s retail stores. With Surface’s departure, O’Brien will return to her prior role of running both groups.\n\nThough Surface remains listed on Apple’s executive biographies website as of Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for Apple confirmed the moves.\n\nThe chief people officer title was created for Surface, who was tasked with overseeing human resources, inclusion, diversity and recruiting for Apple’s roughly 160,000 employees. She previously held a similar role at Medtronic Plc, a health technology company.\n\nSurface had been part of a group of fewer than 20 executives reporting to Cook, who is dealing with a broader changing of the guard at the Cupertino, California-based technology giant.\n\nAt the end of this year, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri is stepping down from that role — though he’s staying on to oversee a smaller array of functions, including real estate and information systems. Dan Riccio, a longtime senior engineering executive who shepherded the Vision Pro, retires this month. Dan Rosckes, the company’s procurement chief, is also exiting. And Matt Fischer, Apple’s App Store head, is leaving in October as well.\n\nThe company’s HR organization has seen other changes recently, with its prior head of diversity and inclusion leaving earlier this year. She was replaced by Cynthia Bowman, who joined from Bank of America Corp.\n\nSurface’s quick departure is rare for executives at her level of seniority. A few years ago, Apple named a new vice president of communications who left after only a matter of months. The company also employed retail chief John Browett for less than a year, but that was more than a decade ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs A Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work How Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium The World’s Central Banks Aren’t Following the Fed’s Lead Anymore Why OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., Oct. 16, 2024 Investment resarch firm Jefferies believes that if the Department of Justice's antitrust action against Google (GOOG, Financial) turns out to be successful, Apple (AAPL, Financial) could lose to one-third of its income from the search behemoth. Targeting Google's partnerships with smartphone manufacturers including Apple, the lawsuit is likely to have major financial reprecussions should the case result in changes in revenue-sharing rules. According to Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, the legal procedure could potentially take up to three to eight years to clear out, with Apple losing one-third of its U.S. Google income. Lee highlighted that, while the potential income loss remains alarming, and in the near-term sales of the iPhone 16 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence have become critical. With around half of Apple's yearly profits coming from the iPhone, it is still the biggest revenue source for the business. Despite the antitrust concerns, Apple's core products are likely to be at the top of the priority list for investors at this point.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\n\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\n\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\n“Unlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one’s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there’s just a lot of money going around.”\n\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\n“We know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.”\n\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\n“Why stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.”\n\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nCramer discussed insights from JPMorgan and Evercore regarding why investors should consider buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, arguing that negativity surrounding the company might be overblown ahead of its earnings report.\n\n“Today, two firms, JPMorgan and Evercore, talked about why you need to buy Apple. Both pieces stress that maybe people have gotten too bearish on the stock ahead of the earnings. So we might need to rethink all that negativity and just buy the darn thing. I mean, it's bizarre that so many people are so eager to hate the stock of one of the greatest companies in history, especially when the stock's been such a great long-term performer. Quizzical, isn't it?\n\nYet this happens whenever they launch a new phone. It feels like almost every day we come in and some analyst lowers their estimates because of tracker work that showed iPhone 16 lead times were short and there's not much demand, right? I mean blah, blah blah.”\n\nCramer noted that the analysts from JPMorgan and Evercore are taking a more optimistic stance. He also emphasized the importance of owning the stock for the long term rather than trading it.\n\n“So many analysts have now shaded down their estimates for Apple that, get this, if business is simply okay, the estimates will prove to be too low. So these two bold analysts at JP Morgan [and] Evercore wanted to take the other side of the trade, the positive side. Plus, many of the objections to Apple may not hold as much water as they did even a couple [of] weeks ago. For example, we know a lot of people were worried about Chinese demand, but get this, if the Chinese government's actually able to stimulate, right, the stimulus plan starts working well, don't you think that China's issues are a smaller concern, more money for consumers in China means more orders for the prestigious iPhone.\n\nThis is why I always say own it, don't trade it. The analysts always try to scare you out of Apple based on incomplete data and from a long-term perspective, think about it, they're always wrong. If you sell Apple in the most recent bout of negativity, you miss a tremendous run over the past week. And then, you did it before that you missed another run, then another and another. No wonder they call this stock the Teflon Don or at least Ben Reitzes over at Melius, a big Apple supporter calls it that, and I like it.”\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL), known primarily for its iconic iPhone, remains one of the most reputable companies in history and is on the brink of a significant upgrade cycle driven by advancements in artificial intelligence. In September, the company introduced a suite of AI-powered features branded as Apple Intelligence. The new offering aims to advance the functionality of the latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs, providing users with tools that facilitate quick writing and summarizing of texts and emails, photo editing, and the creation of personalized images.\n\nWhile the new features were not ready for public release at the launch of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro last month, anticipation is building for the upcoming iOS 18.1, which is expected to be available on October 28. The latest operating system will integrate Apple Intelligence, further expanding the capabilities of Apple devices and promising to improve the user experience significantly.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "TSMC is making chips for Apple in the U.S.",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) has reportedly started making its first chips for a major customer at its new fabrication plant in Arizona.\n\nThe chipmaker is manufacturing A16 chips for Apple at Phase 1 of its Fab 21 in Phoenix, Arizona, independent journalist Tim Culpan reported in September, citing unnamed sources. The chips, which are being made with the 5nm process, are being produced “in small, but significant, numbers,” Culpan said.\n\nTwo people familiar with the matter told Business Insider that production of A16 chips has started but that the facility hasn’t reached full production levels, the publication reported Wednesday.\n\nProduction volume of the A16, which was launched in the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022, “will ramp up considerably” after the second stage of TSMC’s Phase 1 fab is finished, Taiwan-based Culpan said. That would put TSMC’s U.S. site on track to reach its target in the first half of next year, he said.\n\n“The Arizona project is proceeding as planned with good progress,” a spokesperson for TSMC told Culpan. Neither Apple (AAPL) nor TSMC immediately responded to Quartz’s request for comment.\n\nTSMC Arizona’s A16 chips are being manufactured with the same process that it uses for A16 chips in Taiwan, Culpan reported. In September, Bloomberg reported that TSMC’s yield rate, or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process, at its Arizona fab is similar to yield rates at comparable facilities in Taiwan.\n\nIt’s not clear which Apple devices will use the chips, Culpan said.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaker makes an estimated 90% of the world’s advanced chips and counts chipmaking leader Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple as its top partners. In April, the Biden administration announced TSMC would receive $6.6 billion in grants through the federal Chips and Science Act to support its first major U.S. chipmaking hub in Arizona. TSMC’s two chipmaking factories in Arizona are expected to begin production in 2025 and 2028, while some of the anticipated Chips Act funding will support building a third facility.\n\nThe company is expected to report September-quarter revenue of $23.3 billion when it announces earnings Thursday, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the company had sales of $23.6 billion for the quarter.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Dividend Investor 'Feeling Doubly Awesome' By Earning $11,800 Per Year And Beating S&P 500 Shares Portfolio: Top 11 Stocks\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe idea that you can't beat the broader market and see your capital grow by sticking to dividend stocks is becoming outdated. With major tech companies like Meta Platforms, Salesforce and Alphabet, among many others, joining the growing ranks of dividend-paying growth stocks, the opportunities for investors looking for both dividend income and stock price appreciation are expanding.\n\nAbout a year ago, a dividend investor on Reddit shared his success story, saying he was making over $10,000 in passive income and beating the S&P 500 by investing in dividend stocks. He shared screenshots of his investing portfolio, showing his annual income at about $11,800 a year or $991 per month.\n\nWhen asked how much he had invested, the Redditor said his total value was $200,000. Since the investor had highlighted in his post that he was feeling \"doubly awesome\" by making significant dividend income and beating the market, someone asked him whether he had beaten the market for just one year.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing.

Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\n\"3 years in a row,\" the investor responded.\n\nLet's examine some of this portfolio’s biggest holdings to see which stocks helped the investor earn significant dividend income and beat the market.\n\nArbor Realty Trust\n\nArbor Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:ABR) is a mortgage REIT with a dividend yield of over 11%. It was the biggest position in the portfolio of the Redditor making about $11,800 a year in dividends. Analysts believe the future is bright for REITs like ABR amid declining interest rates and hopes of a soft landing. Wells Fargo said in a recent note that \"less restrictive\" policy from the Fed can lay the groundwork for commercial real estate recovery.\n\nAltria\n\nWith an over 8% dividend yield and more than 50 years of consecutive dividend hikes, Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) is perhaps one of Reddit’s most popular dividend stocks despite concerns about the declining use of traditional tobacco products. Analysts believe Altria is making a timely shift toward smoke-free products like vapes and nicotine pouches. MO was the second-biggest holding of the Redditor earning $11,800 a year in dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro\n\nPetroleo Brasileiro ADR (NYSE:PBR) is a state-owned Brazilian energy company. Once famous for its eye-popping dividends, PBR's dividend yield stands at about 13% amid a decline in payouts after a difference of opinion about cash allocation in management. The Redditor, who posted his income report in October 2023, said Petroleo Brasileiro ADR (NYSE:PBR) was his third-biggest holding.\n\nUnited Parcel Service\n\nThe Redditor making $11,800 a year in dividend income had United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) among his biggest holdings. The stock has a dividend yield of about 5% and 15 years of consecutive payout increases. UPS shares are down 15% over the past year. In July, the company reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street estimates on both EPS and revenue. However, the company restarting its $1 billion stock buyback program gave investors something to cheer about.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) has a dividend yield of about 2.6% and the stock has gained 28% over the past year. Citi recently published a bullish note on the semiconductor industry following better-than-expected August data driven by dynamic random access memory. The firm has a Buy rating on TXN.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a dividend yield of about 3.2% and over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Like Coca-Cola, it's considered a defensive stock that investors like for all market cycles. The portfolio screenshots shared by the Redditor making $11,800 annually showed Pepsi among the top holdings.\n\nApple\n\nWhen asked which stocks helped him beat the S&P 500, the Redditor named Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) among the top companies. Apple shares are up 28% over the past year and the company has raised its dividends for more than a decade in a row.\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) was one of the stocks that helped the Redditor beat the S&P 500. The stock is up more than 110% over the past year, thanks to the rising demand for the company's custom AI chips. The stock has a dividend yield of about 1.1%.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) yields over 3% and has increased its payouts yearly since 2011. Cisco's CFO Scott Herren recently said in a conference that the company expects about $1 billion in AI product orders in fiscal 2025, with 30% growth in hyperscalers recorded by the company during the second half 2024 alone.\n\nHome Depot\n\nHome Depot Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares have gained 37% in the past year and the stock yields 2.2%. Home Depot Inc. was among the top holdings of the Redditor making $11,800 a year in dividends. The home improvement retailer has raised its dividends for 15 straight years.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWhen asked about stocks that helped him beat the market, the Redditor said Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the companies that pulled his overall portfolio performance higher than the S&P 500. Microsoft shares are up 26% over the past year and the company announced a 10% bump in dividends last month.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "The tech sector is known for its volatile market action and tendency to deliver strong long-term returns. There are also many failed growth stories and burned-out trends along the way, but the big winners have more than made up for those disappointments. Industry giants like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have made lots of millionaires over the last four decades, and now investors are looking for the next game-changing champion in the same mold.\n\nI'm here to show you a couple of tech stocks that could fill that promise in the long run. A modest investment in MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR) or Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU) could make you millions over the next couple of decades.\n\nNeither one of these companies will have an easy path to that wealth-building future, of course. There are economic challenges and hungry rivals everywhere, and many things can go wrong. But if they play their cards right, these stocks are poised for market-beating returns and decades of shareholder-friendly success.\n\nSo the two names mentioned above are some of my favorite tech stocks to buy today and hold for the long haul. Here's how.\n\nMicroStrategy's massive Bitcoin bet could fuel a future software empire\n\nIt's no secret that an investment in MicroStrategy is a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nThe company owns more of the largest digital currency than almost any other company, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. The only exception is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF(NASDAQ: IBIT), which is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF on the market. MicroStrategy has bought 252,220 Bitcoins so far, and keeps adding to that total every time chairman Michael Saylor can get his hands on some more cash.\n\nThat may not sound like much of a tech stock at first blush. However, Saylor and MicroStrategy have been around for decades, building a respectable suite of enterprise-class data analytics tools. Right now, the aggressive Bitcoin strategy could lay the foundation for epic long-term growth in the software business.\n\nIf Saylor's rosy analysis of Bitcoin's future pricing prospects turns out to be correct -- or at least in the right ballpark -- MicroStrategy would soon have a cash reserve rivaling that of Apple or Microsoft. Saylor's lofty price target of $13 million per coin by 2045 would make the company's current Bitcoin reserves worth nearly $3.3 trillion, not counting any additional Bitcoin buys. Not even Apple can compete with that financial platform today.\n\nIn the tech sector, deep pockets can buy you top-notch engineers and expensive innovation projects. So MicroStrategy is a Bitcoin play today, potentially evolving into a software giant in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku's rock-bottom valuation spells opportunity\n\nCord-cutting isn't a new trend, but it's here to stay. Media-streaming services are taking over the entertainment industry from the old cable, satellite, and broadcast platforms.\n\nRoku was one of the first players on the hardware and software side of this compelling growth story, and remains a leader today. A recent Pixalate report shows that Roku-powered devices hold a 48% share of the connected devices market in North America.\n\nAnd if you think Roku will run out of growth prospects as the U.S. and Canada media markets become saturated with digital streaming platforms -- think again. It's a big world out there and Roku has barely started to explore the foreign business prospects.\n\nChecking up on Roku's financial filings, you'll find that international markets have never produced more than 10% of Roku's total revenues in any given year. In other words, the greenfield growth opportunity is massive.\n\nThe lessons learned in North America should help Roku conquer the digital media world at large. That has turned out to be a plan of game-changing effectivity in the past. If you invested $4,000 in Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) 20 years ago, you'd have more than $1.1 million today. Roku is exploring a similar international growth avenue, and is only getting started.\n\nAt the same time, bears are focused on weak digital advertising sales in recent years, and Roku's stock is trading at the bargain-bin valuation ratio of 2.9 times sales. The low price makes it easier to build a Roku position of game-changing proportions.\n\nI'm not saying that $4,000 invested in Roku today will make you a million dollars by 2044, but any reasonable combination of a solid starting investment and many years of stoic patience should do the job. Long story short, Roku is my favorite stock to buy in the fall of 2024.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,139!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $44,239!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $380,729!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of October 14, 2024\n\nAnders Bylund has positions in Bitcoin, Netflix, and Roku.

        "title": "Intel and AMD Join Forces to Combat ARM's Dominance",
        "content": "Oct. 16, 2024 - Today Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) decided to team up in response to the rising challenge from ARM Holdings in the semiconductor industry. This collaboration will improve software compatibility across their x86-based chips in response to escalating performance of ARM holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) that erode the market share of both companies.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC.\n\nThe x86 architecture is the dominant computing architecture used in laptops, PCs, and data center servers. Intel invented it, and AMD licensed it. Then suddenly ARM came with its computing architecture and presented a competition to both companies by successfully partnering with important clients like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nARM has gained market share due to its energy efficiency and software compatibility. Intel and AMD can't just sit back and watch, they need to do something.\n\nIntel and AMD decided to team up and improve their quality by addressing the same issue they face: compatibility. Intel and AMD use the same x86 architecture but their chips may require software tweaks to work seamlessly together. So, to address this issue, Intel and AMD made an advisory group that consists of leading industry players such as Broadcom, Dell Technologies, Lenovo Group, and Oracle to ensure consistency and compatibility across their chips. So the plan is: Intel and AMD will improve their compatibility and the advisory group will give them feedback.\n\nRecently, Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger stressed that x86 remains very active in the modern world of computing and has great potential for its development in the context of AI. He further stated that scalability has been a unique selling proposition of the architecture stating that x86 still has serious prospects of further advancement.\n\nARM Holdings has significantly impacted the semiconductor industry, particularly in the mobile and embedded markets by its architecture that has eroded the market share of traditional x86 giants like Intel and AMD. Here's why:\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Energy efficiency is the power that ARM possesses that Intel and AMD have struggled with. The architecture is ideal for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets and has high compatibility for embedded systems like IoT devices like smartwatches, and automotive electronics. Licensing Model: AMR's licensing model provides broader flexibility for the clients compared to the traditional way of purchasing chips from Intel or AMD. Ecosystem and Software: ARM's architecture gains support from the open-source communities as they build a robust ecosystem that attracts developers and encourages the creation of applications and solutions specifically for ARM-based platforms. So the support not only comes from the employees but also from the technology community they built. Market Penetration: After successfully penetrating the mobile device market, ARM expanded to other markets like data centers and servers too.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Stock In Buffett Stock Portfolio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list titled Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the top 10 stocks in Buffet's portfolio.\n\nWarren Buffet is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index 2024, the Oracle of Omaha has a net worth of $143 billion, making him the ninth richest person in the world. His wealth would have been much more had he not decided to donate most of his vast fortune to charities. Since 2006, Buffet has donated over $55 billion to various charitable organizations, with a majority of the gifts going to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nBuffet rose to prominence in 1965, after transitioning his investment firm into a conglomerate that held stakes in companies belonging to a broad range of industries. Between then and 2023, his firm earned average annual returns of 19.8%, outperforming most stock indices that delivered returns around the 10 percent mark during this period. However, this year, Buffet seems to be in a defensive mode and is currently in the news for his sell-off spree, significantly reducing his investments in several notable companies.\n\nThere have been mixed opinions about Buffet hunkering down on stocks. Edward Jones analyst, Jim Shanahan, said that the actions make him ‘concerned’ about Buffet’s outlook for the stock market and the American economy. In contrast, Daniel Ives, a Wedbush analyst, is less worried and believes that despite the selling spree, Berkshire still holds the top positions in those stocks by large margins, which should not be viewed as a ‘smoke signal for bad news ahead’.\n\nSo what will Warren Buffet do with all that cash? Andrew Bary, the associate editor at Barron’s, recently stated that the billionaire has been on the look for a major acquisition for some while now, which has so far proven elusive. He believes the Berkshire CEO may just hold the cash for some while, earn interest on Treasury Bills, and wait for potential opportunities to grab in the stock market.\n\nAnother factor that has likely contributed to Warren Buffet dumping stake in some of his top stocks is the speculation around the increase in capital gains tax. The debate on the tax rate has been on for some time now and has even become a talking point in the run-up to the presidential elections. Vice President, Kamala Harris, during a speech in New Hampshire this month, proposed to raise the long-term capital gains tax for wealthy individuals to 28%.\n\nThe current tax rate is 21% when a gain is realized. Massive gains over the long term result in a large tax. Warren Buffet invested in stocks he is currently selling a long time ago, and hence, is sitting on handsome gains. The rationale behind selling these stocks could be to capitalize on the gains as much as possible on the current low tax rate, instead of paying hefty taxes later if the rate were to be increased.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe scanned Warren Buffet’s portfolio, as of June 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $84,248,000,000\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a cornerstone of Warren Buffet’s portfolio for the last several years. However, Berkshire Hathaway’s recent filings revealed it had sold 389,368,450 Apple shares during the second quarter of 2024, representing nearly half of its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nAnalysts believe that while there may be various potential reasons behind the sell-off, it is likely that Warren wanted to lock in gains at a lower tax rate, amid speculations of the capital gains being increased from 21% to 28%. Vltava Fund also believes the decision was influenced by taxation. Here is what the fund stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\nYou probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\n\nDespite the downsizing, Apple remains the top pick in the Buffet stock portfolio, with a holding value of over $84 billion, accounting for 30.09% of the portfolio. Moreover, according to Insider Monkey’s database, 184 hedge funds have investments in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of Q2 2024, making it one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nThe recently concluded third quarter of FY24 was one of the best quarters for Apple in a long while, during which it reported a June quarter record revenue of $85.8 billion, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. Revenue from products grew 2% from last year, driven by the launch of iPad Pro and iPad Air, to reach $61.8 billion. Services revenue also reached an all-time high of $24.2 billion, registering a 14% spike from last year. Gross margin stood at 46.3%, which was within the higher range of the guidance. EPS was recorded at $1.40, beating analysts expectations of $1.35 per share.\n\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant reported $39.3 billion from iPhone sales in Q3, which accounted for nearly half of Apple’s overall revenue for the quarter. The figure was down 1% year-over-year and is attributed to the 6.5% drop in sales in China, where the company faces fierce competition from local manufacturers like Huawei. While the dip in iPhone revenue has caused some investor concern, most remain bullish on the stock after the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the new iPhone 16.\n\nThere is consensus among Wall Street analysts on the stock’s Buy rating with a share price upside potential of 8.58%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st among the Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Tenacious Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "There are many ways to make a million dollars in the stock market, but one method is more reliable than the rest.\n\nHistory shows that patient investors can build a million-dollar portfolio with the help of modest annual returns over a long time. This is a good description of master investor Warren Buffett's strategy, and an even better fit for index fund legend John Bogle. So if you're looking for a million-dollar investment idea, you should really search for companies and stocks that can stay relevant and financially healthy for decades to come.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to introduce you to three tenacious stocks that can carry that heavy weight. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN),  International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM), and Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) should at least match the stock market's average returns for the foreseeable future. Making steady investments in these robust stocks could make you a millionaire over time.\n\nThe secret sauce of durable winners\n\nThe most important quality in long-term business empires is flexibility. My three picks are very different examples of this trait:\n\nIBM has been around for more than a hundred years. What started as a maker of punch-card calculators evolved into a mainframe computing powerhouse and a PC systems pioneer. Now, IBM is leaning into the big-ticket opportunities of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) services. Berkshire was once a large manufacturer of fabrics. Buffett liquidated its textile mills to finance takeovers in various fields. Today, it's a giant of the insurance, manufacturing, transportation, and consumer goods industries with deep interests in other areas. iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been Berkshire's largest holding since 2018. Amazon started as a pure online bookseller, managed in founder Jeff Bezos' garage. The company added more products to its catalog until it became synonymous with the concept of e-commerce in North America. Amazon is expanding its operations around the world, adding a world-class shipping network and a massive cloud computing system along the way, and always hunting for the next big idea.\n\nThese companies are always ready to change with the times. You will often find them in the vanguard of the next marketwide sea change. That's exactly what I want to see in my long-term investments.\n\nSmart ways to invest like a future millionaire\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, but these three companies have proven their ability to stay ahead of the times.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire has built a cross-sector conglomerate for the ages, managed by some of the world's best business minds. Big Blue is turning decades of AI research into a terrific near-term growth driver, surely to be followed by another unexpected strategy shift that will be helpful in the 2040s and beyond. Amazon has been around for 30 years but is still acting like a hungry little upstart with tons of unexplored markets and business ideas.\n\nYou can pick any combination of these stocks to power a diversified investment portfolio in the long run. Getting started with a robust investment today is a good start, but you'll do even better if you commit to building on that investment for years to come. With a dollar-cost averaging strategy, you can buy more shares when they're cheap and fewer when they're not, averaging out market volatility along the way. Automating the process with weekly, monthly, or annual stock buys can help you stay on track.\n\nAnd don't forget to enable a dividend reinvestment program (DRIP) for IBM, where the generous dividend payments make a big difference to your long-term returns: IBM Total Return Price Chart\n\nThere you have it: IBM, Berkshire Hathaway, and Amazon can help you make a millionaire over the next few decades. They may not get the job done quickly, but truly wealth-building investments always take time. You'll follow in the footsteps of Bogle, Buffett, and many other investing geniuses. They should always be a part of a diversified portfolio, but these ultra-flexible companies are almost single-ticker index funds on their own.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Internet Content Stock to Buy?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at $25.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios, 62.3% of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\n\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at $2.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\n\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\n\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\n\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC’s Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nHundreds of millions of people use Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) hardware and software services to access a wide variety of internet content, making it one of the best stocks for internet content investors. Millions of people access the internet via the 1.8 billion Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gadgets that are in use globally. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an internationally recognized supplier of internet content due to its streaming service, Apple TV+, Apple Podcasts, and other media offerings.\n\nIn fiscal Q3 2024, the California-based tech behemoth revealed Apple Intelligence, an AI-powered personal system for its new iPhones, which might spark a supercycle of iPhone upgrades. The company’s $85.8 billion in revenue was up 5% year over year as iPhone sales reached $39.3 billion, while Mac revenue increased 2% to $7 billion. The company’s economic moat is supported by AAPL’s solid financial history, which includes improvements in net income and revenue over the preceding ten years.\n\nMorningstar analysts increased their estimate of the company’s fair value from $170 to $185 based on an increased projection of iPhone revenue. Experts predict that the iPhone market will expand significantly in 2025 and 2026 as a result of Apple’s increasing artificial intelligence capabilities. However, considering that the present valuation accounts for an unsustainable 20% increase in iPhone revenue in fiscal 2025 owing to difficulties in China and slow upgrade cycles, they still believe the company’s stock is expensive.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 400,000,000 shares worth $84.25 billion as of Q2.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than APPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$233 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$234 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Analyst price target for AAPL is US$241, which is 3.1% above our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Model\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$123.0b US$133.8b US$163.8b US$177.5b US$186.4b US$193.6b US$200.3b US$206.7b US$212.8b US$218.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x13 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Est @ 3.88% Est @ 3.47% Est @ 3.18% Est @ 2.97% Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$114.7k US$116.3k US$132.7k US$134.1k US$131.2k US$127.1k US$122.6k US$117.9k US$113.2k US$108.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$219b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.5%) = US$4.7t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.7t÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.3t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$234, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.157. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Qualcomm's stock slipped 2.2% on Tuesday and has declined another 0.9% premarket Wednesday after Citi analysts placed the company on a negative catalyst watch, citing weaker handset demand and other headwinds in its latest note.\n\nCiti expressed concerns about cooling PC and wireless demand—two key sectors that together represent 38% of semiconductor demand.\n\n\"There is also excess inventory in the handset end market (17% of semi demand), which could be a headwind for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM),\" Citi noted, highlighting potential challenges for Qualcomm in the coming quarters.\n\nThe analysts warned that these issues could contribute to lowered forecasts for QCOM's December quarter.\n\nAdding to Qualcomm's challenges, Citi cited the potential loss of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as a customer beginning in 2025 as another downside risk.\n\n\"We are launching a negative catalyst watch on QCOM, given our expectations of lowered forecast in addition to Apple going away beginning in 2025.\" the analysts stated, indicating concerns about further revisions to earnings estimates.\n\nCiti said its own estimates for Qualcomm's December quarter are 11% below consensus, reflecting the company's vulnerabilities.\n\nThe broader semiconductor sector is also facing challenges, according to the bank. Citi predicts a muted third-quarter earnings season.\n\n\"We expect aggregate Consensus estimates to decline during 3Q24 earnings season,\" Citi said, referencing cooling demand in the PC and wireless markets as well as worsening conditions in the automotive sector.\n\nWhile AI demand remains a bright spot for the semiconductor industry, Citi is adopting a more cautious outlook through the end of 2024.\n\nADI emerged as Citi's top pick as the analysts shift to a defensive stance in the sector, alongside other Buy-rated names like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), AVGO, and MU.\n\nWith Qualcomm facing multiple headwinds, Citi's negative outlook could place further pressure on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nQualcomm stock slips as Citi opens a negative catalyst watch\n\nProcter & Gamble set to report tepid revenue growth\n\nASML draws investor scrutiny after warning shocks global chip markets\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple is losing to Huawei in China. Here's why",
        "content": "Since releasing its Mate 60 Pro series last August, Chinese tech giant Huawei has made a comeback in China’s smartphone market, knocking Apple (AAPL) from its pedestal.\n\nHuawei and other homegrown smartphone makers have experienced double-digit growth this year, boosting smartphone shipments in China by 8.9% year-over-year in the second quarter, according to the International Data Corporation.\n\nChina’s Vivo, Huawei, Oppo, Honor — a former subsidiary of Huawei — and Xiaomi made up the top sharers of China’s smartphone market, respectively. Apple, meanwhile, fell to sixth place. And despite cutting prices on some iPhone models to compete, the data showed Apple’s year-over-year sales declined 3.1%.\n\nApple’s iPhone shipments in China experienced “marginal decline” in the second quarter of this year, Counterpoint Research said, noting that during the same period last year, Apple had the third-highest number of shipments — only behind Oppo and Vivo — while Huawei was in sixth place.\n\nApple’s fall in China can be tied to many factors, experts said, including the country’s faltering economy and changes in how its citizens view their country versus the rest of the world amid the pandemic and the growing number of sanctions imposed by the West.\n\n“There’s a higher degree of nationalist sentiment right now within China, of buying local and buying the home team versus buying an American product,” Arthur Dong, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Quartz.\n\nHuawei is the Chinese economy’s “national champion”\n\nSince Huawei was placed on the U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 under former President Donald Trump, the company has faced increasingly tough trade restrictions under President Joe Biden — especially on the latest generation of semiconductors such as those from Nvidia (NVDA), Dong said.\n\nEscalating trade rules on China and Huawei are putting the tech company, which has ties to the Chinese government and which Dong called “a national champion for the Chinese economy,” “in a tough spot right now.”\n\n“Huawei is scrambling right now to try to find alternative sources for these all-important chips, as well as some very significant self-development efforts to try to replicate these technologies and build chips on their own,” Dong said. “With regard to that issue, China is having a really difficult time being able to replicate the chips that sort of fuel AI advancements simply because they don’t have access to the tools and the machinery that build these chips, all of which are within the confines of U.S. export controls.”\n\nDong said he doesn’t see the current situation getting better for Huawei. With another round of restrictions expected over the next few months, the “gaps” that China and Huawei depend on to move around sanctions “are going to be closed,” he said.\n\nApple is no longer a status symbol\n\nIn the early 2010s, Apple was seen as a “legitimate, ultimate symbol of status,” Andy Tsay, professor of business and analytics at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business, told Quartz.\n\nTsay, who is also a visiting professor in Peking University’s MBA program, said his friends in China would “place their orders” with him for iPhones because Apple’s products were more difficult to find there and there were shortages. Now, there are more Apple Stores in the country.\n\n“There really was no comparison, no competitor,” Tsay, who has visited China roughly every year since 2006, said. “Now, people still think Apple is a fine and legitimate luxury product. But the difference is, they’re not fanboys and fangirls anymore.”\n\nOn his most recent visit to China a few months ago, Tsay asked his MBA students, part of China’s professional class, what they thought about their iPhones.\n\nWhile his students told him that they are satisfied with their iPhones, they also said their next phone “won’t necessarily be an Apple,” and that “there are some Chinese options that are pretty good.”\n\n“I’ll get whichever phone has the best price-to-benefit ratio,” Tsay’s students told him.\n\nChina’s undergoing deepening economic woes and a post-pandemic cultural shift\n\nIn 2020, Huawei had 18% of the world market for smartphones, Dong said. Two years later, that number fell to 2%, largely because Huawei was restricted from necessary chips and components, he said, and he doesn’t see the company rebounding soon.\n\n“They’re still facing challenges in the Chinese market because the overall consumer economy of China has gone into a tailspin,” Dong said. “Apple’s problems are mostly related to the fact that the Chinese consumer has gone into hibernation and they can’t afford this kind of phone because their entire economy is, in a sense, collapsing.”\n\nHuawei’s growing sales are “only because their phones are a lot cheaper than Apple’s phones,” Dong said. If Huawei and other Chinese smartphone makers are offering cheaper alternatives, consumers will want those smartphones, he added.\n\nChina is “more isolated” than it was during its superpower status in the 2010s, Tsay said, likely due to anti-Chinese sentiments stemming from the pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, companies are “trying to extricate themselves from being too reliant on China,” and Western governments continue to ban China’s access to certain technologies, such as equipment to build advanced semiconductors.\n\n“You combine that all together with the rise of domestic products, and if people, locally, can feel a little bit good about themselves by supporting the home team, there’s a little bit of something in the trend,” Tsay said.\n\nHuawei’s chips could be “more bark and less bite”\n\nThere are two views of the AI chips in Huawei’s smartphones, Dong said.\n\n“On the one hand, it could send us an alarming signal that China has the ability to create their homegrown chips,” Dong said. “But there are other stories that you will see where these chips have been examined and the engineering analysis on them is that they’re not even close to the capabilities of what Nvidia is producing — that it’s actually several generations and years behind.”\n\nDespite Huawei’s “headline-grabbing” announcements about developing its own chips, Dong said he finds it difficult to imagine how the company has made its advanced chips without access to critical machines and components under trade restrictions.\n\n“This is perhaps more bark and less bite when it comes to this announcement that they have advanced-level chips,” Dong said.\n\nHuawei and Apple’s competition goes beyond AI features\n\nThe competition between Apple and Huawei in China is also tied to the difference in what Apple can offer its U.S. consumers versus its Chinese consumers, Tsay said.\n\nApple’s advantage in the U.S. is its control over its ecosystem, according to Tsay, allowing it to deliver a differentiated user experience. China, however, has a “unique situation” where its “version” of Apple’s iOS is WeChat.\n\n“You almost don’t need the tightly integrated, walled garden of the Apple ecosystem in China to deliver that experience because it already exists inside the WeChat world,” Tsay said. “That gives the local cell phone companies an advantage in the sense that they can use Android or their own version of Android or a brand new operating system — they don’t need to create that self-contained ecosystem that Apple has so painstakingly created over the years because Tencent already did it for them by creating WeChat.”\n\nThe one place the two companies differ, Tsay said, is with Apple’s security and privacy features. “Of course, nobody in China has any expectation of security and privacy when they are online,” he said.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Norges Bank Reduces Stake in Mobileye Global Inc",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Norges Bank executed a significant transaction involving the sale of 84,217 shares in Mobileye Global Inc (NASDAQ:MBLY), an industry leader in autonomous driving technologies. This move reduced the firm's holdings in Mobileye to 4,850,094 shares, reflecting a minor position change of -1.71% in their portfolio. The shares were traded at a price of $13.70 each.\n\nProfile of Norges Bank\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MBLY.\n\nNorges Bank, headquartered at Bankplassen 2, Oslo, is a prominent investment entity known for its strategic equity holdings across various sectors, with a strong emphasis on technology and financial services. The firm manages an impressive equity portfolio valued at approximately $669.35 billion, featuring top holdings in major corporations such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Norges Bank Reduces Stake in Mobileye Global Inc\n\nIntroduction to Mobileye Global Inc\n\nFounded in Israel, Mobileye Global Inc specializes in the development and deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving solutions. Since its IPO on October 26, 2022, Mobileye has been at the forefront of innovating autonomous vehicle technologies, contributing significantly to the Vehicles & Parts industry.\n\nFinancial and Market Analysis of Mobileye Global Inc\n\nAs of the latest data, Mobileye Global Inc holds a market capitalization of $9.87 billion, with a current stock price of $12.175. The company's financial health shows a PE Ratio of 0.00, indicating it is currently not generating profits. The GF Score of 24/100 suggests a challenging outlook in terms of future stock performance. Norges Bank Reduces Stake in Mobileye Global Inc\n\nImpact of the Trade on Norges Bank's Portfolio\n\nThe recent reduction in Mobileye shares by Norges Bank has had a minimal impact on its overall portfolio, with the position now accounting for just 0.01% of its total investments. This adjustment reflects a strategic shift possibly due to the stock's underperformance and the firm's portfolio rebalancing.\n\nPerformance Metrics of Mobileye Global Inc Post-Transaction\n\nSince the transaction date, Mobileye's stock price has declined by 11.13%, with a year-to-date drop of 70.55% and a decrease of 54.42% since its IPO. These figures highlight the stock's volatile journey and the challenges it faces in a competitive market.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Future Outlook\n\nThe market's reaction to Mobileye's financial performance and Norges Bank's recent stock reduction has been tepid, reflecting concerns over the company's profitability and growth trajectory. However, Mobileye's ongoing innovations in autonomous driving technology could pivot its market position if successfully commercialized.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nNorges Bank's decision to reduce its stake in Mobileye Global Inc aligns with the stock's recent performance and market challenges. While the future holds potential for recovery and growth, particularly in the autonomous driving sector, investors should closely monitor Mobileye's strategic initiatives and market adaptation. This transaction by Norges Bank could signify a cautious approach towards an industry fraught with both opportunities and significant risks.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Acknowledges Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Facing ‘Near-Term Headwinds’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the market.\n\n“Never get tired of all-time highs. We are experiencing a time for the market which is what I said would happen when the Fed starts cutting rates when the economy is still solid.”\n\nCramer said that the key reason the market roared to highs was strong earnings from top banks. He said since the Fed’s interest rate cuts have just started, investors believe maybe the “best is yet to come.”\n\nJim Cramer wondered whether this strong performance trend would be a “pattern” in this earnings season.\n\n“We will find out soon enough. We will see if the positive action will be sustained.”\n\nCramer recommended investors to “listen to the calls” this earning season and “ponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.”\n\n“We are at the beginning of one of the year’s four reporting periods. Probably the most exciting. I can’t believe I still get fired up, but man, am I ever.”\n\nFor this article, we watched the latest episodes of Jim Cramer’s ‘Lightning Round’ segment on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he was talking about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). im Cramer acknlowedges Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is Facing ‘Near-Term’ Headwinds\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nTalking about an analyst downgrade on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Jim Cramer acknowledged that iPhone maker is facing some “near-term” headwinds but urged investors to buy the stock.\n\n“When everyone knows there are real issues, though, you will have a limited window to buy the stock after the expected post-weakness.”\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features. But the latest numbers for iPhone 16 do not show much enthusiasm for the new device.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n“You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia Inches Closer to Overtaking Apple in Market Value",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA, Financial) ended at an unprecedented high on Monday, bringing it within close distance of Apple (AAPL,Financial) as the most valuable company in the world. The economic value of Nvidia is at $3.39 trillion and thus, it is behind Apple's $3.52 trillion only, but ahead of Microsoft's $3.12 trillion. This jump attests to solid investors' belief in Nvidia's present and future AI chip products.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nEarlier this year, Nividia briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) to become the world's most valuable company. Nevertheless, the tech giants have since repositioned themselves thoroughly, and their market caps bounced around with more fluctuation for several more months.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street has placed Nvidia among critical contenders for the position of the market leader for next-gen AI tech, manufacturers of which include Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial), Amazon (AMZN, Financial), and Microsoft. TD Cowen analysts indicate that the investment environment in the AI space is competitive and calls for more Australia's needs to invest continuously, which investment is critical in preparing for potential obstacles in the burgeoning field.\n\nNvidia expects further sales growth even if it experiences a production slowdown of the Blackwell chips it is expected to release. Sales of other chips for artificial intelligence deployments are expected to remain steady at least. TD Cowen has placed Nvidia as their Top Pick for investment, and the firm reaffirms its price target of $165.\n\nBefore the reporting season starts emotions are also rather high: both Apple and Microsoft have increased their movements which led to S&P 500 record. Nvidia along with companies like Apple and Microsoft jointly hold appreciable weight at the S&P 500.\n\nAs we look ahead, Nvidia has forecasted revenue surge to almost $125.8 billion thanks to continued investments in AI data centres, according to LSEG data. Still, there is some wariness regarding the further stable growth of AI spending.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK A Morgan Stanley report showed that lead times for Apple's (AAPL, Financial) iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models have grown of late, underscoring robust demand ahead of the first phase of Apple Intelligence, expected to launch on October 28. Though general lead times continue decreasing on a year-over-year basis, the Pro and Pro Max models saw jumps in wait times to 20.5 days and 27.5 days, respectively.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nSlated to be released on the iOS 18.1 update, Apple Intelligence's first phase will likely offer enhancements to Photos and Safari, a new Siri interface, along with improved writing capabilities. Moreover, these changes are likely to be available across all users by December, and non-English upgrades are scheduled by March 2025.\n\nLead by Erik Woodring, Morgan Stanley analysts have hailed Apple's effective supply chain management for its lower lead times compared to yesteryears. Additionally, early component preparation by suppliers should help prevent supply constraints that usually delay iPhone shipments.\n\nFurthermore, as we look to target the low-end smartphone market, Apple's iPhone SE4 is likely to be widely available by March 2025 for around $499. Also, accessible on October 23 will be the new iPad Mini, tailor-made for Apple Intelligence.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif. Tuesday saw tech behemoth Apple (AAPL, Financial) revealing a new iPad mini with AI in mind. Backed by a robust A17 Pro processor and 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, the latest iteration of the iPad mini hopes to offer customers a significantly improved experience.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nPerhaps the biggest plus point is it's designed to fit incredibly well with Apple Intelligence, arguably the company's biggest catalyst. Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, stated, \"With the powerful A17 Pro chip, faster connectivity, and support for Apple Pencil Pro, the new iPad mini delivers the full iPad experience in our most portable design at an incredible value.\"\n\nThe device costs around $499 for the 128GB variant, and the new iteration of the iPad is still in pre-order only for now and will likely be sold beginning October 23. With the first phase of Apple Intelligence scheduled to be released with iOS 18.1 on October 28, this launch effectively aligns with the general progression towards AI. Along with other AI-driven technologies, the upgrade will offer a new-look Siri interface and fresh writing tools. Also, December will offer more advanced features; with non-English upgrades scheduled by March next year.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In August 1997, Apple was on the edge of collapse. Its finances were in shambles and the tech giant that once stood at the forefront of innovation was nearing bankruptcy.\n\nEnter Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, Apple's longtime rival, who unexpectedly became the story’s hero. Gates stepped in with a $150 million investment, a move that saved Apple and became one of the most talked-about moments in tech history.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\n\"Apple was in very serious trouble,\" Steve Jobs admitted at the 2007 D5 tech conference alongside Gates. At the time, Jobs had just returned to Apple and found the company desperately needing help. His willingness to reach out to Gates – someone who had been a fierce competitor – marked a turning point for the company. As Jobs explained during the conference, \"Apple was very weak and so I called Bill up and we tried to patch things up.\"\n\nMicrosoft’s investment was more than just financial support; it represented a shift in mindset. According to Jobs, \"Apple didn't have to beat Microsoft. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they'd forgotten who Apple was.\" This mentality allowed both companies to coexist, with Microsoft becoming the largest software developer for Apple's Mac platform.\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nWhen Jobs announced the deal at the 1997 MacWorld conference, Gates made an appearance via satellite to a chorus of boos from the audience. But for both companies, it was a win. Microsoft gained a business opportunity, while Apple got the boost it needed to stay afloat. Reflecting on the investment a decade later, Gates said, \"That's worked out very well.\"\n\nIn an iconic moment, Steve Jobs publicly thanked Gates for his help, telling him, \"Bill, thank you. The world's a better place.\" This gratitude was even immortalized on the cover of Time Magazine, a symbol of the profound impact this partnership had on the tech world.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nDespite a very public rivalry, the investment marked a turning point for Apple and the personal relationship between Gates and Jobs.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a 60 Minutes interview with Charlie Rose, Gates recalled visiting Jobs on his deathbed and grew emotional. Reflecting on their relationship, Gates explained: “He and I, in a sense, grew up together. We were within a year of the same age and we were kind of naively optimistic and built big companies. And every fantasy we had about creating products and learning new things – we achieved all of it. And most of it as rivals. But we always retained a certain respect and communication, including even when he was sick.”\n\nThough the deal raised some eyebrows, it wasn't the end of competition between Apple and Microsoft. Both companies continued to thrive, shaping the tech industry’s future together.\n\nTheir collaboration was a powerful reminder that rivals can find common ground, even in the most unexpected circumstances.\n\nRead Next:\n\nGroundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $500 Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple on Tuesday launched its new generation of the iPad mini packed with AI features including writing tools and an improved Siri assistant, as the iPhone maker races to boost its devices with artificial-intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe new iPad mini is powered by Apple's A17 Pro chip, which is used in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. With a six-core central processing unit, the A17 Pro would boost CPU performance by 30% compared to the current generation iPad minis and is central to running Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI software.\n\nApple said it would roll out the first set of AI features in the U.S. version of the English language this month through a software update with iPadOS 18.1.\n\nThe features will be available for iPads with A17 Pro or M1 chips and later generations, Apple said, adding it will roll out additional features including image-generation tools, Genmoji and ChatGPT-powered capabilities over the next several months.\n\nApple in September unveiled its long-awaited, AI-boosted iPhone 16 lineup, but with the AI features still in test mode, the company failed to excite some investors while early sales data raised some questions around demand.\n\nStill, research firm Canalys on Monday said the iPhone 16 would help Apple's sales in the fourth quarter and drive momentum into the first half of 2025, after Apple reached a record high third-quarter shipments.\n\nThe iPad mini, starting at $499, is available for pre-orders starting on Tuesday and will begin arriving to customers and Apple store locations next week, Apple said.\n\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

The rally has cemented Apple’s status as the world’s largest company, with a market valuation above $3.6 trillion.\n\nWhile there’s been a strong advance by bit tech companies more broadly, Apple’s has been particularly strong. The stock has risen 37% over the past six months, more than twice the 15.5% gain of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nApple has been supported by excitement over the introduction of an iPhone with AI features, which went on sale last month. Earlier on Tuesday, the company introduced a new iPad mini built for similar capabilities.\n\nEvercore ISI issued a tactical outperform trading call on the stock ahead of its quarterly results, expected later this month.\n\n“Bearish investors remain focused on the Chinese smartphone market, but we think the risk here is overstated and can be offset by growth in developing markets and a strong upgrade cycle in the US where our survey work points to strong upgrade demand, driven in part by AI,” the firm wrote.\n\nMelius Research is also positive on the stock, citing its “unparalleled buyback” and writing that growth is picking up amid a “multi-year cycle ahead in iPhone.”\n\nThough early signs of demand for the phone have been tepid, investors have continued to embrace the stock, seeing it also as a safe haven against macroeconomic uncertainty.

The versatility and advanced capabilities of the new iPad mini are taken to a whole new level with support for Apple Pencil Pro™, opening up entirely new ways to be even more productive and creative. The 12MP wide back camera supports Smart HDR 4 for natural-looking photos with increased dynamic range, and uses machine learning to detect and scan documents right in the Camera app.\n\nThe new iPad mini features all-day battery life and brand-new experiences with iPadOS® 18. Starting at just $499 with 128GB — double the storage of the previous generation — the new iPad mini delivers incredible value and the full iPad experience in an ultraportable design. Customers can pre-order the new iPad mini today, with availability beginning Wednesday, October 23.\n\n\"There is no other device in the world like iPad mini, beloved for its combination of powerful performance and versatility in our most ultraportable design. iPad mini appeals to a wide range of users and has been built for Apple Intelligence, delivering intelligent new features that are powerful, personal, and private,\" said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. \"With the powerful A17 Pro chip, faster connectivity, and support for Apple Pencil Pro, the new iPad mini delivers the full iPad experience in our most portable design at an incredible value.\"\n\nA17 Pro Unlocks Powerful Performance\n\nThe new iPad mini gets a major update with A17 Pro, delivering incredible performance and power efficiency in an ultraportable design. A17 Pro is a powerful chip that unlocks a number of improvements over A15 Bionic in the previous-generation iPad mini. With a 6-core CPU — two performance cores and four efficiency cores — A17 Pro delivers a 30 percent boost in CPU performance.1 A17 Pro also brings a boost in graphics performance with a 5-core GPU, delivering a 25 percent jump over the previous generation.1 A17 Pro brings entirely new experiences — including pro apps used by designers, pilots, doctors, and others — and makes it faster than ever for users to edit photos, dive into more immersive AR applications, and more. The new iPad mini brings true-to-life gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — as well as support for Dynamic Caching and hardware-accelerated mesh shading. From creating engaging content faster than ever in Affinity Designer, to playing demanding, graphics-intensive AAA games like Zenless Zone Zero, users can take the powerful performance and ultraportable iPad mini anywhere.\n\nBuilt for Apple Intelligence\n\nWith the power of the A17 Pro chip, the new iPad mini delivers support for Apple Intelligence. Deeply integrated into iPadOS 18, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device, and Private Cloud Compute offers the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.\n\nThe first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in U.S. English this month through a free software update with iPadOS 18.1, and available for iPad® with A17 Pro or M1 and later. Apple Intelligence delivers experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them:2\n\nWith Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Siri® becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPad. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words, can maintain context from one request to the next, and now, users can type to Siri. Siri also has extensive product knowledge to answer questions about features on iPad and other Apple devices. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description, and with the new Clean Up tool, they can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.\n\nAdditional Apple Intelligence features will be rolling out over the next several months:\n\nImage Playground allows users to create playful images in moments. Image Wand is a new tool in the Apple Pencil® tool palette that can transform a rough sketch into a polished image. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji™ by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be able to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users’ content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. With ChatGPT integrated into experiences within iPadOS 18, users have the option to access its expertise, as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities, within Siri and Writing Tools without needing to jump between tools. And privacy protections are built in so a user’s IP address is obscured, and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT’s data-use policies apply for those who choose to connect their account.\n\nEven Faster Connectivity\n\nWith faster wireless and wired connectivity, users can do even more on iPad mini while on the go. The new iPad mini supports Wi-Fi 6E, which delivers up to twice the performance than the previous generation,3 so users can download files, play games online, and stream movies even faster. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with peers, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad mini are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad mini in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier. The USB-C port is now up to 2x faster than the previous generation, with data transfers up to 10Gbps, so importing large photos and videos is even quicker.\n\nIncredible Camera Experience\n\nGreat cameras, along with the incredibly portable form factor of iPad mini, enable powerful mobile workflows. The 12MP wide back camera delivers gorgeous photos, and with Smart HDR 4, they will be even more detailed and vivid. Utilizing the powerful 16-core Neural Engine, the new iPad mini uses artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically identify documents right in the Camera app and can use the new True Tone® flash to remove shadows from the document. The 12MP Ultra Wide front-facing camera in portrait orientation, with support for Center Stage™, is great for all the ways customers use iPad mini.\n\nMagical Capabilities with Apple Pencil Pro\n\nApple Pencil Pro unlocks magical capabilities and powerful interactions, turning iPad mini into a sketchbook users can take anywhere. Apple Pencil Pro can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. Users can roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper, and with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark. Apple Pencil Pro features support for Find My®, and pairs, charges, and is stored through a new magnetic interface on the new iPad mini. iPad mini also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.\n\niPadOS 18 Brings Powerful and Intelligent New Features\n\nIn addition to the groundbreaking capabilities of Apple Intelligence, iPadOS 18 brings powerful features that enhance the iPad experience, making it more versatile and intelligent than ever. iPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML® that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver powerful AI features right on device.\n\nDesigned for the unique capabilities of iPad, Calculator delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions, as well as basic and scientific calculators with a new history function and unit conversions. With Math Notes, users are now able to type mathematical expressions or write them out to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. They can also create and use variables, and add an equation to insert a graph. Users can also access their Math Notes in the Notes app, and use all of the math functionality in any of their other notes. In the Notes app, handwritten notes become more fluid, flexible, and easy to read with Smart Script and the power of Apple Pencil. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting. And as users write with Apple Pencil, their handwriting will be automatically refined in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible. With new Audio Recording and Transcription, iPad can capture a lecture or conversation, and transcripts are synced with the audio, so users can search for an exact moment in the recording. New levels of customization come to iPad, and users have even more options to express themselves through the Home Screen with app icons and widgets that can be placed in any open position. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make them appear larger to create the experience that is perfect for them. Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, delivering quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls. Users can even organize new controls from third-party apps in the redesigned Control Center. The Photos app receives its biggest update ever, bringing users powerful new tools that make it easier to find what they are looking for with a simplified and customizable app layout that takes advantage of the larger display on iPad and helps users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Users have new ways to stay connected and express themselves in Messages, with all-new animated text effects, redesigned Tapbacks, and the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time.\n\nBetter for the Environment\n\nThe new iPad mini is designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The new iPad mini meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from all packaging by 2025.\n\nToday, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations and, as part of its ambitious Apple 2030 goal, plans to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.\n\nPricing and Availability\n\nCustomers can pre-order the new iPad mini starting today, October 15, on apple.com/store, and in the Apple Store® app in 29 countries and regions, including the U.S. It will begin arriving to customers, and will be in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Resellers, starting Wednesday, October 23.

        "title": "'Soft landing' optimism spurs broad Wall Street rebound at big banks",
        "content": "The biggest banks staged a broad Wall Street rebound in the third quarter, as corporate clients got more comfortable issuing new debt and pursuing mergers while some traders recorded one of their best quarters in years.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) said Tuesday that its investment-banking fees were up 20% from the year-ago period. Bank of America reported its highest third-quarter trading revenue in more than a decade. And Citigroup‘s investment-banking fees were up 44%.\n\nExecutives at these banks are optimistic that the start of an interest rate-cutting cycle at the Federal Reserve — which last month reduced its benchmark rate by 50 basis points — will mean more deals in the near future.\n\n\"My recent conversations with clients have been quite constructive,” Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts Tuesday. “The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity.\"\n\nCEO Jane Fraser said in a statement that \"in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction.\"\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan touted \"year-over-year growth in investment banking and asset management fees, as well as sales and trading revenue.\"\n\nCombined investment banking fees at Goldman, Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which reported its results last week, were $6.5 billion. That amounted to a 27% rise from a year earlier and 1% increase from the last quarter.\n\nCombined trading revenue for those same Wall Street giants was $23.4 billion, a 6% increase from a year earlier and a 3% increase sequentially.\n\nAnother big Wall Street player, Morgan Stanley (MS), releases its third-quarter earnings Wednesday.\n\nThe results thus far offer the latest sign that a two-year-long dealmaking drought appears to be ending, helping banks to cushion uneven results in their consumer operations. Overall profits at Bank of America and Citigroup fell when compared to the year-earlier period.\n\nCertainly there are some uncertainties that could upend that optimism, including unrest in the Middle East and the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election in November.\n\n\"The big unknown, or the big factor that's out there remains, you know, more of the geopolitical issues, but also what happens with the US election, and we'll kind of have to see how that plays out,\" said Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, in 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGoldman finds itself in a much stronger position than it was a year ago when its CEO was grappling with a slump in dealmaking, the costly exit from consumer lending, and a series of high-profile departures from the firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestment banking fees were $1.8 billion, up 20% from the year-ago period, as companies issued more debt and equity. Even its advisory fees were up slightly thanks to a revival in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nGoldman’s trading revenue rose 2% year over year, driven primarily by a strong performance from its equities traders, while asset and wealth management revenue increased 16%.\n\nFixed-income trading did not do as well. Revenues from that unit were down.\n\nGoldman’s stock is up this year more than any of its other big-bank rivals. It was roughly flat in Tuesday morning trading.\n\nBank of America also outperformed expectations for its Wall Street operations, as revenue from trading rose 12% and revenue from equity and debt issuance increased 16% and 37%, respectively.\n\nThe bank’s sales and trading revenue was up for its 10th consecutive quarter and reported its highest third quarter performance in more than a decade.\n\n\"For our clients, and whether that's institutional or individual investors, things feel pretty, pretty reasonable,\" Jim DeMare, president of Bank of America global markets business, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"The US economy has been surprisingly resistant, meaning a hard landing seems to be not a topic today and a soft landing with some kind of leaning towards a no-landing seems to be becoming popular,\" he added.\n\nInvestment banking was definitely a bright spot for Citigroup, which helped the lender post a smaller-than-expected profit drop in the third quarter. Net income fell to $3.2 billion from $3.5 billion a year ago.\n\nLike Goldman, it did well in equities trading but trading of bonds fell.\n\nIts stock fell by more than 2% in Tuesday morning trading.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple Poured $1B A Year Into Its Car Project Before Abandoning It. Tim Cook's Company Now Pulls Plug On Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit In California: Here's More\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has terminated its self-driving vehicle testing permit in California. The decision follows the company’s earlier abandonment of its electric vehicle project.\n\nWhat Happened: The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed that Apple requested the cancellation on Sept. 25, with the permit officially ending on Sept. 27, according to macReports.\n\nThis move aligns with previous reports by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, indicating Apple’s retreat from the electric vehicle market after a decade-long effort.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nBeating the market through ethical real estate investing' — this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors – here’s how to join with just $100 Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nApple’s permit, granted in 2017, allowed the testing of autonomous vehicles with safety drivers on public roads. The permit was initially set to remain valid until April 2025.\n\nThe company had been utilizing leased Lexus SUVs, outfitted with sensors and cameras, to experiment with self-driving technology on California streets.\n\nSee Also: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nThis cancellation marks a significant shift in Apple’s strategy, effectively closing the chapter on its autonomous vehicle ambitions.\n\nThe decision comes just days before Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its Robotaxi, highlighting the competitive landscape in autonomous vehicle development.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple’s decision to end its self-driving car testing in California is a major development in the tech and automotive industries.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\n\nBull Market and Investor Sentiment\n\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\n\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy and 7 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\n\nIt’s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\n\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn’t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\n\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\n“Now is the time to just be cautious. Don’t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won’t work,” the portfolio manager told CNBC’s “The Exchange.\n\n“While our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don’t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\n\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\n\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock’s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you’ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\n\ndavid-dvoracek-19-rJG0QENU-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, as it reduces its reliance on the hardware business. While the company is best known for its iPhone product line, it’s also a key player in cloud computing, offering various services, including game subscriptions and app sales.\n\nThe iPhone product line accounted for 52% of Apple’s $296.1 billion revenues for the three quarters that ended in June. Likewise, Apple has moved to reduce its reliance on the iPhone product line by focusing on the service front, which is expected to be a key driver of long-term value.\n\nConsequently, the company has been growing its prospects in advertising, supporting products, cloud service, app store sales, and payments. During the most recent three-month period, services sales increased by 14.1% to $24.2 billion.\n\nMoreover, the service sector boasts of a significantly greater gross margin than hardware, at 74% compared to 35.3% for hardware sales. They also provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is exactly what shareholders want.\n\nEven as Apple faces slow hardware sales, it is increasingly investing in artificial intelligence as it seeks to enhance user experience with its devices. New devices are coming with AI-powered software to help summarize text, boost writing skills, and edit photos as Apple seeks to fuel sales.\n\nThere is no doubt that Apple trades at a premium as a growth stock with a price-to-earnings multiple of 34.7 compared to an average P/E of 28 for the S&P 500. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s premium valuation is expected, given its robust growth on the services front, as it also strengthens its hardware products with AI. Its ability to generate and return value through stock buybacks while offering a 0.44% dividend also underscores why it is a solid long-term growth stock.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street believe Apple is a strong buy with an average price target of $248.90, implying a 9.32% upside potential from current levels. Overall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. According to the Insider Monkey database, Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $84.25 billion\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Shares of Nvidia closed at their highest ever on Monday, putting the heavyweight AI chipmaker on the brink of dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company.\n\nWith investors betting on strong demand for its current and next-generation AI processors, the Santa Clara, California company's stock climbed 2.4% to end the day at $138.07.\n\nIn June, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company. It was overtaken by Microsoft, and the tech trio's market capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.\n\nThe latest gains lifted Nvidia's market value to $3.39 trillion, just below Apple's $3.52 trillion value and above Microsoft's $3.12 trillion.\n\nNvidia has been Wall Street's biggest winner from a race between Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and other major tech companies to dominate emerging AI technology.\n\n\"We believe the major companies in AI ... face an investment environment characterized by a Prisoner's Dilemma — each is individually incentivized to continue spending, as the costs of not doing so are (potentially) devastating,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a report on Sunday.\n\nTD Cowen reiterated its $165 price target for Nvidia, which it called its \"Top Pick\", and it said demand for the company's current generation of AI chips remained strong.\n\nNvidia in August confirmed reports that a ramp-up in production of its upcoming Blackwell chips was delayed until the fourth quarter, but downplayed the impact, saying customers were snapping up existing chips.\n\nAs investors gear up for quarterly reporting season, Apple rose almost 2% and Microsoft added 0.7%, helping propel the S&P 500 up 0.8% to its own record high close.\n\nNvidia, Apple and Microsoft account for about a fifth of the S&P 500's weight, giving them a hefty influence in the index's day-to-day gains and losses.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the contract manufacturer that produces Nvidia's processors, is expected to report a 40% leap in quarterly profit on Thursday, thanks to soaring demand.\n\nAnalysts expect spending to build out AI data centers will help Nvidia's annual revenue more than double to nearly $126 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nWhile Nvidia's rally has lifted the S&P 500 to record highs, investors worry optimism about AI could evaporate if signs emerge of a slowdown in spending on the technology.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "Qualcomm Set For 50% Surge In Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 Shipments By Late 2024, Analyst Predicts\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is shooting upward after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo commented on the company’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 shipments.\n\nThe analyst noted that Qualcomm’s stock price has already factored in the negative impact of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) developing its own 5G chips. The company is poised to benefit from better-than-expected momentum in the fourth quarter of 2024 and favorable trends in 2025, including AI smartphone and AI PC growth and increased System on Chip (SoC) prices due to the adoption of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s (NYSE:TSM) 3-nanometer process, as per Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nAlso Read: China Is Eating Apple’s Lunch: Where Smartphone Maker Ranks Vs Asian Competitors\n\nAccording to the analyst, among Qualcomm’s mobile SoCs this year, the most expensive and profitable Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 (SD8G4) will see most of its 2024 shipments in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo noted that compared to SD8G3, SD8G4’s second-half 2024 shipments would likely increase 50% to 9 million units, with an ASP increase of 15% to $180, contributing significantly to fourth-quarter 2024 revenue and profit.\n\nThe analyst noted that the significant growth in SD8G4 shipments is attributed to a more extended shipping period, increased demand from Samsung, and recent Chinese smartphone market dynamics.\n\nChinese brand smartphones reached about 80% market share during the recent Golden Week holiday sales, with shipments growing 20% (versus iPhone, which was flattish), which will likely continue through the fourth quarter of 2024, Ming-Chi Kuo said.\n\nAs per the analyst, the market share of high-end smartphones (above 4000 RMB) in China will likely grow from 25%–30% in 2023 to 30%–35% in 2024.\n\nHe added that Chinese smartphone market shipments will likely grow by 3% to 280 million units in 2024, and continued growth is likely in 2025.\n\nPrice Action: QCOM stock is up 3.32% at $175.63 at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nAlso Read:\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Boosts Sales, But Base Models Lag, Analyst Says\n\nLatest Ratings for QCOM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 JP Morgan Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for QCOM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks right now.\n\nTechnology Sector’s ‘High Bar’\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on October 10, Drew Pettit, Director of US Equity Strategy at Citi Research, shared his thoughts about the upcoming earnings season and its potential impact on the market. With the Dow and S&P 500 reaching new closing highs, Pettit raised the question of whether earnings would justify the current valuations. The technology sector has been on a tear, with many software names running up significantly in recent weeks. However, Pettit’s warning suggests that investors should be cautious about getting too caught up in the hype. He noted that when there’s a high bar, investors should be prepared for potential disappointments.\n\nPettit sounded a note of caution when it came to the tech sector, particularly software stocks. He noted that software has the highest bar within tech, not just in terms of growth expectations but also in terms of monetization. Many software companies are not seeing the expected growth in the next three years, which is already priced into their valuations. This mismatch between expectations and reality could create volatility in the sector.\n\nIn terms of specific guidance, Pettit expects companies to use the current uncertainty as an excuse to walk down expectations for Q4. This is a typical trend in US markets, where companies tend to set low expectations and then beat them. Pettit advises investors to focus on companies that can deliver on their promises.\n\nOverall, Pettit’s comments suggest that investors should be cautious about the tech sector, particularly software stocks, and focus on companies that can deliver on their promises. He also emphasizes the importance of looking beyond the current quarter and focusing on long-term growth prospects.\n\nTech Sector Will Thrive Despite Short-term Challenges\n\nDan Flax, Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman is bullish on the technology sector, with a focus on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the next generation of workloads and are executing well on their product cycles. Flax expects concerns about cyclical headwinds to remain a factor but also sees select opportunities in the sector. He also noted that enterprise customers are looking to adjust to changes in the landscape cyclically and invest in transforming their organizations, which will drive technology spending in the second half of the decade.\n\nAs investors navigate the current market landscape, it is essential to approach the tech sector with a sense of caution. While the sector has been experiencing a significant upswing, investors should focus on companies that have a proven track record of delivering on their promises, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding certain stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 most profitable tech stocks right now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to compile an initial list of the 40 largest technology companies by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to companies with positive TTM net income and 5-year net income growth informed by reputable sources, including SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into 5-year growth rates, and Macrotrends, which supplied information on trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income. Then we sorted the stocks in ascending order, according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple (AAPL): Leading the Pack Among the Most Profitable Tech Stocks Right Now\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nTTM Net Income: $101.95 Billion\n\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 12.85%\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world’s largest technology companies, known for its iconic products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to influence consumer electronics and technology industries globally. The company has a loyal customer base and innovative hardware-software integration makes it a leader in consumer technology.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has achieved remarkable success with its Vision Pro, capturing 57% of the total value in its category globally in Q1, despite only holding a 17% unit selling share.\n\nOn June 28, the Apple Vision Pro was launched in major Asian markets including China and Japan, as well as key Western countries such as Germany, France, and the UK in September, which will potentially boost the company’s market share.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has integrated various LLM models in its products that position it well in the AI competition and is a key driver of its success. By allowing users to select various LLM models, including ChatGPT, to utilize with Siri, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can generate revenue from the LLM that comes preloaded on the devices.\n\nThis approach ensures that the company can benefit from the growing demand for AI applications without needing to develop the best model. Analysts expect the company to increase its earnings by 15.16% this year. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovative strategy, dominant position in the cloud and AI markets, and strong growth prospects make it an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of most profitable tech stocks right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock Apple Inc. (AAPL) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of +5.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.5%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.54 indicates a change of +13.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.48 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $390.59 billion and $422.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +8.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "For roughly six decades, Warren Buffett has generated wealth-building returns for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders. The legendary investor has an uncanny knack for finding superior businesses with underappreciated growth opportunities. Buffett's talents have made him one the wealthiest people in the world -- and created many millionaires among Berkshire's shareowners.\n\nYou, too, could grow richer alongside Buffett by investing in his best ideas. Here are two of Berkshire's largest stock holdings, both of which remain solid buys today.\n\nWarren Buffett stock to buy No. 1: Occidental Petroleum\n\nBuffett has long appreciated the value of reliable and cost-effective energy sources. One of his favorite companies is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Berkshire owns over $14 billion worth of the oil and gas producer's common stock, along with additional preferred stock and warrants that give it the option to increase its stake in the future.\n\nOccidental's operations are providing its customers with dependable energy at a time when conflicts in Europe and the Middle East threaten to disrupt international supply networks. Occidental owns some of the most valuable acreage in the U.S., including 2.8 million acres in the oil-rich Permian Basin.\n\nMoreover, Occidental's $12 billion acquisition of CrownRock in August bolstered its ability to produce low-cost energy, with some assets even capable of generating a profit when oil trades for less than $40 per barrel. With the price of crude oil currently trading for more than $75 per barrel, Occidental and its shareowners stand to profit handsomely.\n\nOccidental earned $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. The company is prudently using some of this cash to pay down debt and strengthen its balance sheet. It's also passing some of this cash on to shareholders via dividends. Occidental raised its quarterly cash payout by 22% to $0.22 per share in February. Its stock currently yields a solid 1.6%.\n\nLooking ahead, decarbonization solutions represent a massive growth opportunity. Occidental's expertise with enhanced oil recovery techniques, which use carbon dioxide to harvest more oil from older fields, should give it a powerful advantage in the high-potential area of carbon capture, utilization, and storage. CEO Vicki Hollub plans to supply the technical know-how that other businesses will use to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground or harvest it for other use cases. Hollub thinks there could eventually be 1,000 such carbon capture facilities across the globe.\n\nStory continues\n\nExxonMobil estimates that the market for these and other carbon management services will grow to a shocking $4 trillion by 2050. Occidental is likewise enamored with the industry's prospects. So much so that its leadership believes its carbon-related ventures could one day produce more profit than its oil and gas operations. Consider buying Occidental's shares now before more investors come to appreciate this innovative energy producer's vast growth potential.\n\nWarren Buffett stock to buy No. 2: Apple\n\nMuch has been made of Buffett's decision to sell roughly half of Berkshire's stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). But what many investors overlooked was that the legendary investor decided to hold on to 400 million shares of the technology titan, a stake valued at a whopping $88 billion dollars.\n\nIt's clear why Buffett made sure Apple remains Berkshire's largest stock holding by far. (Its stake in its second-biggest holding, American Express, stands at roughly $42 billion.) The iPhone maker is still one of the most profitable businesses in history, and it could be on the verge of a massive artificial intelligence-fueled upgrade cycle.\n\nIn September, the tech giant unveiled Apple Intelligence. The suite of AI-powered features promises to make the company's latest iPhones, iPads, and Macs even more useful. People can use Apple's new \"personal intelligence system\" to quickly write and summarize texts and emails, edit photos, and create personalized images. Apple also gave Siri, its personal assistant technology, an AI-driven performance upgrade to improve its ability to understand and respond to natural language prompts.\n\nImportantly, Apple designed its new AI tools with privacy in mind, so user data is used only for specific user requests and never stored. That's in stark contrast to several of Apple's AI rivals, which have been criticized for misleading users about the true extent of their data-collection activities and failing to protect user confidentiality.\n\nApple's new AI features are thus expected to boost sales of its phones and computers -- and allow it to charge higher prices for its devices over time. Demand for advanced AI features should also lift Apple's high-margin services revenue via higher App Store sales.\n\nWith more than 2.2 billion devices in use around the globe, Apple is in prime position to become a formidable force in the rapidly expanding AI arena. All told, Wall Street expects the tech leader to grow earnings by more than 11% annually over the next half-decade. That's an impressive pace of expansion for a $3.5 trillion business. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit as Apple enters a new phase of AI-powered growth.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\n\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August’s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\n\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\n\nUnderstanding Inflation Trends and Federal Reserve Strategy\n\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's ‘Money Movers',he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\n\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\n\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\n\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets a range of technology products, including smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories, while also offering related services. The product lines include the iPhone, a series of smartphones running on the iOS operating system. It is the 5th most profitable stock on our list.\n\nThe Mac line consists of personal computers based on macOS, including laptops such as the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, as well as desktops like the iMac and Mac Pro. The iPad, a multipurpose tablet operating on iPadOS, includes models like the iPad Pro and iPad mini.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) operates primarily on a geographic basis, with reportable segments that include the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Rest of Asia Pacific. Each segment is managed separately to cater to local customer needs and market conditions.\n\nOn October 6, Bloomberg reported that the company is moving away from its traditional annual product upgrade cycle to allow for more frequent releases and fewer delays. Previously, the company updated major products like iPhones and Macs on a set schedule, unveiling software in June and launching devices in September and October.\n\nHowever, the growing range of products has made this approach impractical. As a result, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is adopting a staggered release strategy, as can be seen by its upcoming AI tool, Apple Intelligence, set to launch on October 28 with iOS 18.1. The shift aims to improve innovation and enable revenue generation outside the holiday quarter.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Piper Sandler recently maintained a Neutral rating on the shares with a price target of $225. In an investor note, the advisory said it surveyed about 13,500 teens as a part of the firm's Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2024 survey, and based on the responses, it continued to believe the stock was fairly valued at current levels, as the data did not suggest a 2024 super cycle. However, Piper noted upgrade expectations were up from the 20% level in its Spring 2024 survey. In addition, only about 30% of teens were upgrading any of their Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which to the firm felt low given the enthusiasm. Piper acknowledged that the average iPhone among teens was about 3 generations behind the iPhone 16, meaning these older models could just be due for an upgrade.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy if Trump Wins in November?",
        "content": "Only once in U.S. history has a former president who lost reelection after his first term managed to become president again. The last time it happened was in 1892 when Grover Cleveland became the first -- and, so far, only -- president elected for two non-consecutive terms.\n\nBut Cleveland might soon have company. Former President Donald Trump is running neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race. If elected, his policies could impact the businesses of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" companies: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? Former President Donald Trump. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nTrump's proposals that could impact the Magnificent Seven\n\nThree major Trump proposals could impact the Magnificent Seven the most. The GOP presidential nominee's proposed corporate tax cuts arguably belong at the top of the list.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed legislation that overhauled the federal corporate tax rate structure. Previously, large corporations paid federal taxes of 15% to 35%. After the Trump tax cuts, these businesses paid a flat tax of 21%. The former president wants to slash this rate to 15% if he's elected again.\n\nAnother key part of Trump's economic policy for a potential second term is the implementation of across-the-board tariffs. He promises to impose tariffs of up to 20% on all imported products. Trump, who has referred to himself as \"Tariff Man,\" wants to impose tariffs of 60% on goods imported from China. He has also threatened to enact tariffs of 100% on products made in Mexico.\n\nWhen Trump was president before, he was a fan of deregulation. Reducing federal regulations is likely to be a major focus again if he returns to the White House. Trump wants to eliminate 10 existing regulations for every new regulation. One promise that's especially relevant to the Magnificent Seven is his pledge to repeal an executive order signed by President Biden that regulates artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHow the Magnificent Seven could be affected\n\nPaying less in federal taxes should be good for all the Magnificent Seven. However, the impact of Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts perhaps won't be as great as it might seem. As the following table shows, none of these giant companies pay the 21% federal tax rate in place now.\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate in the Last Fiscal Year Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.7% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18.0% Nvidia 12.0% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nSteeper tariffs could especially impact the Magnificent Seven companies that rely on imported products and components. Although the companies would probably pass the increased costs along to consumers, the higher prices could negatively impact sales.\n\nApple would likely be the hardest hit by tariffs because of its global supply chain. All the others could also feel some effects of higher tariffs. The Magnificent Seven members that generate more revenue from services, particularly Alphabet and Meta, would probably be the least impacted by Trump's proposed tariffs.\n\nWhat about Trump's deregulation focus? I think the major cloud service providers -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- could be helped by reduced AI regulations. So would Nvidia and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Meta and Tesla.\n\nHowever, Trump has specifically criticized Alphabet, telling Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo in a recent interview, \"Google has been very bad. They've been very irresponsible. And I have a feeling that Google's going to be close to shut down, because I don't think Congress is going to take it.\" The former president has also called Meta's Facebook \"a true enemy of the people\" in a social media post.\n\nAnd while Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports Trump for president, Trump's proposed policies could hurt Tesla. The GOP presidential nominee has railed against federal incentives for electric vehicles in the past. On the other hand, he told an audience at one of his rallies, \"I'm for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly.\"\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins\n\nSo, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump wins in November? I think it's a close contest between Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft might be helped more by Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts because it pays the highest effective tax rate of the Magnificent Seven companies. Both Microsoft and Nvidia could be hurt to some extent by the former president's tariffs but helped by his regulatory stance. Neither has been singled out for attacks by Trump as Alphabet and Meta have nor have the industries in which they operate been the target of his ire like Tesla.\n\nI believe Nvidia has stronger growth prospects than Microsoft, though. If I had to pick just one Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Trump returns to the White House, I would buy Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This week in Bidenomics: The 'election trade' is on",
        "content": "It’s finally here. Not the election itself, but the clearest opportunity yet to bet on election winners and losers.\n\nInvestors have been eyeing the election all year, since the outcome has major implications for tax policy, trade, immigration, and many companies that could benefit or suffer from forthcoming changes. But many factors affect the value of stocks and other assets, including economic developments and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Inflation and jobs data, plus the Fed’s interest rate cuts, have largely been driving markets for most of 2024.\n\nThose factors are now fading into the background, at least until Election Day on Nov. 5. The latest reports on jobs and inflation show, reassuringly, that the economy remains strong as inflation fades. There won’t be any interest rate news out of the Fed until after the election, so Wall Street is looking for different market-moving triggers.\n\nTheir names are Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. In an Oct. 11 report, analysts at Citi explained “how to trade the US election,” based not just on who wins the White House but on which party controls each chamber of Congress. “With September [jobs] out of the way, Election Day quickly approaching, and polls being quite close, elections should now become a much larger, more consistent driver of markets,” the Citi analysts explained. Place your bets: Harris and Trump (AP Photo/File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOrdinary investors might want to sit this one out. There are countless permutations of stock, bond, commodity, and currency price fluctuations that could occur as markets price in a Harris or Trump victory. “It’s all about getting through the event and having a clear winner on Nov. 6,” said Jeff Hirsch, editor in chief of the Stock Trader’s Almanac. “Specific stocks and sectors vis a vis the two candidates are less important, from my perspective.”\n\nThat won’t stop active traders from speculating on the election outcome, and the action could temporarily affect the direction of 401(k) plans and other routine investments. The stock market typically rises during an election year, as it has in 2024, with the S&P 500 up 22% so far. But October can be shaky. Volatility jumps and stocks tend to wobble. So far this month, volatility has tipped upward, on cue, with stocks up a tad.\n\nElection bets are based on four basic scenarios: Harris or Trump winning with their party gaining full control of Congress, or Harris or Trump winning while Congress remains split between Democrats and Republicans. That will determine if the next president governs with a friendly Congress able to pass partisan legislation or with a divided Congress unable to pass the president’s favorite bills.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the odds of Harris or Trump winning are roughly 50-50, there's a good chance the next president will have a divided Congress. Investing firm Raymond James puts the odds of a Republican sweep with Trump as president at 30%, and the odds of a Democratic sweep with Harris as president at 25%. Harris winning with a split Congress is 25% likely, with a Trump win and divided Congress at 20%.\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nEach combo portends different policies affecting markets. Taxes are a prominent example. Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate, and she might be able to do that if she wins with Democratic control of Congress. Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate and eliminate a variety of other taxes, which he might be able to do if he wins with Republican control of Congress. A divided Congress, with either president, would probably bring the fewest tax changes. Who's the favorite? CBS News hosts a vice presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance (L) and Gov. Tim Walz. (Michele Crowe/CBS via Getty Images) (CBS Photo Archive via Getty Images)\n\nEither president could impact markets through regulation and other executive actions, with no need for congressional action. The biggest changes under Trump would be more tariffs, protectionist trade wars, and the deportation of migrants. Harris would represent more of the status quo, including the ongoing rollout of billions in green energy subsidies and aggressive support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInvesting firms are busy calculating the first-, second-, and third-order effects of such changes on the value of individual assets. Oppenheimer, for instance, recently highlighted five Trump-friendly stocks and five Harris-friendly stocks. On the Trump ledger: Tractor Supply (TSCO), Goldman Sachs (GS), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and AT&T (T). On the Harris ledger: Five Below (FIVE), KKR (KKR), Sunrun (RUN), AppLovin (APP), and Comcast (CMCSA).\n\nCiti’s election trades range from broad sectors to more arcane plays involving the strength of the dollar and currency exchanges. Solar stocks, for instance, tend to rise when Harris seems more likely to win, and vice versa. Crypto-related assets do better when Trump’s election odds rise. As for the election-related currency trades, it should suffice to say, don’t try this at home.\n\nThe overall market might enjoy a relief rally once the election is finally over, but some shares could rise or fall based on expected changes once there’s more clarity about the next four years.\n\nInvesting firm Evercore, for instance, points out that the auto and electronics industries would be most exposed to a new Trump trade war. But Trump’s focus on more fossil fuel production could benefit oil and gas producers. Harris wants more caps on drug prices, which could dent drugmaker profits. But her efforts to build more housing could benefit home builders.\n\nBuy or sell accordingly.\n\nThere’s also the prospect of a contested election, with no clear winner for days or weeks after Nov. 5. That could spook markets more than any campaign policy. If we dodge that bullet, however, we’ll be back to parsing Fedspeak and scrutinizing economic data in just a few weeks.\n\nIt'll probably feel welcome.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Set to Launch iOS 18.1 and Apple Intelligence, Shifting from Annual Upgrade Cycle Amid Concerns Over iPhone Demand",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Latest reports, first published by news platform Bloomberg, suggest that the company plans to launch iOS 18.1 and Apple Intelligence later this month at an event that will also debut new Macs and an iPad mini, with shipments starting in early November. Per the news publication, this represents a moving away from the annual product upgrade cycle. Apple stock has been impacted by concerns around slowing demand for new iPhones as well as delays in the release of Apple Intelligence on new devices. Apple Intelligence is a suite of AI features that the company is marketing for the new devices that run on AI-optimized chipsets.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese authorities are investigating four Taiwanese employees at Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple Inc.’s main assembly partner, for suspected criminal activities including bribery, according to Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\n\nThe quartet were detained by the police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said earlier this week. Zhengzhou is where Hon Hai, the flagship company of Foxconn Technology Group, operates the world’s largest iPhone assembly plant. Local media in Taiwan reported that the four Hon Hai employees were detained earlier this year.\n\n“The suspects are being investigated by the relevant authorities over suspected criminal acts including bribery and misappropriation of funds,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said late Friday. She added that authorities are still investigating and will strictly handle the case in accordance with the law and protect the parties’ legal rights.\n\nA Foxconn representative didn’t have any immediate comment on the TAO’s statement outside of regular office hours.\n\nFoxconn’s iPhone plant in Zhengzhou — called “iPhone City” because it cranks out the majority of Apple’s marquee devices — is considered one of the country’s signature manufacturing projects. It employs hundreds of thousands of workers and delivers a major boost to the economy of the land-locked province of Henan.\n\nThe latest detentions came after Chinese regulators last year conducted tax audits and reviewed land use by Foxconn when company founder Terry Gou was bidding to become the leader of democratic, self-ruling Taiwan, which China sees part of its territory. Chinese tax authorities handed out a 20,000 yuan ($2,800) fine to a Foxconn subsidiary for overstating expenses. It is still unclear whether Chinese regulators have completed their probe into Foxconn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are “full.”\n\n“If you see what’s happening, numbers (earnings)  have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don’t want to get ahead of that.”\n\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the “anchor” of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\n\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve’s next moves.\n\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9,  Wolfe Research’s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a “substantial” majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is “off the table.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): iPhone 16 Delays Due to Supply and New Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 16 delivery times are lagging behind historical trends, but analysts suggest this could be due to stronger supply and high-end buyers holding off for the upcoming Apple Intelligence.\n\n“In Week 3 of our Apple Product Availability Tracker, delivery lead times are showing trends which, if continued, will explain the weaker lead times for the Pro models in the initial weeks as only an aberration led by a combination of better supply mix as well as delay in pick up in momentum from higher-end consumers awaiting the release of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence,” J.P. Morgan analysts, led by Samik Chatterjee, stated in a note to investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nShipping times for iPhone 16 base models in the U.S. improved to 10 days in week three, compared to 17 days the previous week. However, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models saw no change, remaining at 23 and 29 days, respectively. The trend in China mirrored this, with base models seeing faster delivery times while Pro versions stayed steady.\n\n“In aggregate, although overall lead times for the iPhone 16 models are still lower relative to iPhone 15 last year, narrowing of the gap between the two groups (Base vs. Pro) over the last week as well as steady lead times for the Pro models are highlighting the likelihood that the initial slower momentum in demand for the Pro models is correcting itself with the release of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence drawing closer,” Chatterjee added.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s data echoed this sentiment. “iPhone 16 lead times as of Sept 27th are still tracking lower than the past 3 iPhone cycles, but lead times for 16 Pro/Pro Max models are now extending/stabilizing across all regions that we track, an unexpectedly positive development,” noted analysts led by Erik Woodring.\n\nInterestingly, lead times for the Pro and Pro Max have grown by two days since last week, a trend more in line with the iPhone 12 and 13 models, rather than the iPhone 14 and 15, which saw shorter wait times at this stage in the cycle. “But interestingly, iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max lead times have extended by 2 days since last Tuesday, an unexpectedly positive trend that more closely resembles the trajectory of the better-performing iPhone 12 and 13 Pro/Pro Max models,” Woodring added.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, it still lags behind TSM's stronger growth trajectory.\n\nTSMC Could Outpace Broadcom In the Trillion-Dollar Race\n\nWhile both stocks are positioned to benefit from AI, TSMC has the edge, with superior technical indicators and greater market cap potential.\n\nWith an imminent leap toward $1.23 trillion in market cap if it meets analysts’ upside potential, TSM appears more likely to reach the trillion-dollar club before Broadcom.\n\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

        "title": "AI 'Godfather' Yoshua Bengio: We're 'creating monsters more powerful than us'",
        "content": "Whether you think artificial intelligence will save the world or end it — there’s no question we’re in a moment of great enthusiasm. AI, as we know, may not have existed without Yoshua Bengio.\n\nCalled the “Godfather of Artificial Intelligence,\" Bengio, 60, is a Canadian computer scientist who has devoted his research to neural networks and deep learning algorithms. His pioneering work has led the way for the AI models we use today — such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude.\n\n\"Intelligence gives power and whoever controls that power — if it's human level or above — is going to be very, very powerful,\" Bengio said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. \"Technology in general, is used by people who want more power: economic dominance, military dominance, political dominance. So before we create technology that could concentrate power in dangerous ways — we need to be very careful.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bengio and two colleagues — former Google (GOOG) VP Geoffrey Hinton (winner of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics), and Meta (META)’s chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun — won the Turing Award (known as the Noble Prize of computing). In 2022, Bengio was the most cited computer scientist in the world. And Time magazine has named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nDespite helping to invent the technology, Bengio has now become a voice of caution in the AI world. That caution comes as investors continue to show a great deal of enthusiasm on the space — bidding up shares of AI plays to fresh records this year.\n\nAI chip darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock is up 162% year to date, for example, compared to the S&P 500's 21% gain.\n\nThe company is now valued at a staggering $3.25 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data, trailing Apple (AAPL) slightly for the title of most valuable company in the world.\n\nI interviewed Bengio on the possible threats of AI and which tech companies are getting it right.\n\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhy should we be concerned about human-level intelligence?\n\n\"If this falls in the wrong hands, whatever that means, that could be very dangerous. These tools could help terrorists pretty soon, and they could help state actors that wish to destroy our democracies. And then there is the issue that many scientists have been pointing out, which is the way that we're training them now — we don't see clearly how we could avoid these systems becoming autonomous and have their own preservation goals, and we could lose control of these systems. So we're on a path to maybe creating monsters that could be more powerful than us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOpenAI, Meta, Google, Amazon — Which big AI player is getting it right?\n\n\"Morally, I would say the company that's behaving the best is Anthropic [major investors include Amazon and Google]. But I think they all have biases because of the economic structure in which their survival depends on being among the leading companies, and ideally being the first to arrive at AGI. And that means a race — an arms race between corporations, where the public safety is likely to be the losing objective.\n\nAnthropic is giving a lot of signs that they care a lot about avoiding catastrophic outcomes. They were the first to propose a safety policy where there's a commitment that if the AI ends up having capabilities that could be dangerous, then they would stop that effort. They are also the only ones along with Elon Musk who've been supporting SB 1047. In other words, saying 'yes, with some improvements we agree that having more transparency of the safety procedures and results and liability if we cause major harm'.\n\nThought on the huge run up on AI stocks, like Nvidia?\n\n\"What I think is very certain is the long term trajectory. So if you're in it for the long term, it's a fairly safe bet, except if we don't manage to protect the public... [Then] the reaction could be such that everything could crash right? Either because there's a backlash from societies against AI in general or because really catastrophic things happen and our economic structure crumbles.\n\nEither way, it would be bad for investors. So I think investors, if they were smart, would understand that we need to move cautiously and avoid the kind of mistakes and catastrophes that could harm our future collectively.\"\n\nThought on the AI chips race?\n\n\"I think the chips clearly are becoming an important piece of the puzzle, and of course, it's a bottleneck. It's very likely that the need for humongous amounts of computation is not going to disappear with the kinds of events, the scientific advances I can envision in the coming years, and so it's going to be a strategic value to have high end AI chips capabilities — and all the steps in the supply chain will matter. There are very few companies able to do it right now, so I expect to see a lot more investments going on and hopefully a bit of a diversification.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Salesforce introducing 1 billion autonomous agents by 2026?\n\n\"Autonomy is one of the goals for these companies, and it's a good reason for it economically, commercially, this is going to be a huge breakthrough in terms of the number of applications that this opens up. Think about all the personal assistant applications. It requires a lot more autonomy than what current state of the art systems can provide. So it's understandable they would aim for something like this. The fact that Salesforce (CRM) is thinking they can reach it in two years, for me, is concerning. We need to have guardrails, both in terms of governments and technologically, before that happens.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom vetoed California's SB 1047 — Was that a mistake?\n\n\"He didn't give reasons that made sense to me, like wanting to regulate not only the big systems but all the small ones... There's a possibility that things can move quickly — we talked about a few years. And maybe even if it's a small possibility, like 10% [chance of disaster] we need to be ready. We need to have regulation. We need to have companies already going through the moves of documenting what they're doing in a way that's going to be consistent across the industry.\n\nThe other thing is the companies were worried about lawsuits. I talked to a lot of these companies, but there's already tort law, so there could be lawsuits anytime, if they create harm. And what the bill was doing about liability is reducing the scope of lawsuits... There were 10 conditions, you need to have all of these conditions for the law to support the lawsuit. So I think it was actually helping. But there's an ideological resistance against any involvement — anything that's not the status quo, any more involvement of the state into the affairs of these AI labs.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be the world's largest company, with a $3.4 trillion market cap, but that doesn't mean it will retain that place forever. Some cracks in Apple's armor could make it vulnerable, allowing other companies to pass Apple in market cap.\n\nHere are three stocks that could be worth more than Apple five years from now.\n\nWhat's wrong with Apple?\n\nApple isn't the company it used to be. It used to be at the forefront of innovation and consistently released game-changing products. It hasn't done that for some time, and even the latest iPhone (iPhone 16) seems to be struggling despite its much-hyped Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAll of this adds up to a business that hasn't grown its sales since 2022. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite that, Apple's stock fetches a premium valuation, trading for 30.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's a premium price tag for a company that hasn't grown at all, leaving it susceptible to other stocks surpassing it. If it doesn't show growth soon, the premium will not be maintained.\n\nPlenty of other stocks could surpass Apple if this happens, and all of them are likely better investments right now.\n\nNvidia and Alphabet are within striking distance\n\nFive years from now, the three companies that I think can pass Apple are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). These three are obvious choices, as they round out the rest of the top four largest companies in the world.\n\nUnderstanding why these three could surpass Apple is key, as they all have different reasons.\n\nStarting with the second-largest company, Nvidia, it is nipping at Apple's heels. It's only 5% away from dethroning Apple, and with the massive demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence (AI) model creation, it's nearly a surefire bet to be larger than Apple.\n\nDespite its incredible growth this year, Wall Street still expects 42% revenue growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026). That far exceeds anything Apple will put up, but Nvidia trades for 47 times forward earnings -- a far greater price tag than investors are paying for Apple.\n\nIt will take some time for this premium to come down, but I think it's possible over the course of five years.\n\nMicrosoft is next in line, only 11% away from the top spot. Microsoft has been a stalwart, growing revenue by more than 15% over the past year. It also rides on the back of AI, with its cloud computing division, Azure, leading the way for the company. It trades for 31.5 times forward earnings, nearly identical to Apple's price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Microsoft actually has the growth to support this valuation. So, as the market comes to its senses with Apple stock, don't be surprised to see Microsoft pass Apple in market cap.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft could easily surpass Apple in the next few years, Alphabet's chances are slightly lower.\n\nAlphabet needs help from a valuation standpoint to pass Apple\n\nAlphabet's case rests on its premium increase and Apple's decrease. Alphabet's revenue growth has been in the low teens for the past year, which places it far above Apple.\n\nHowever, Alphabet doesn't fetch the premium Apple does and trades for 21.5 times forward earnings. That's cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades at 23.5 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet were to fetch the same premium as Apple (30.5 times forward earnings), it would have 42% upside. That would give it a $2.88 trillion market cap, only 19% away from Apple. If Alphabet continues its pattern of growth and Apple continues its pattern of stagnation, that would be an easy gap to close over five years, allowing Alphabet to surpass Apple.\n\nAdditionally, Apple's premium could decrease to the market average, which would provide a similar effect to Alphabet's rise.\n\nI think there is a strong chance Apple is worth less than these three if it doesn't start growing sales soon. If it launches a new product that's a hit, then these projections likely won't hold true.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has asked Alphabet's Google and Apple to block Chinese fast fashion e-commerce firm Temu in their application stores in the country so it cannot be downloaded, a minister said on Friday.\n\nThe move was intended to pre-emptively protect the country's small and medium-sized businesses against cheap products being offered by PDD Holdings' Temu, communications minister Budi Arie Setiadi told Reuters, even though authorities have not found any transactions yet by its residents on the platform.\n\nTemu's rapid growth has triggered scrutiny over its low-cost business model of sending parcels to customers from China by several countries.\n\nTemu's business model, which connects consumers directly with factories in China in order to significantly reduce prices, is \"unhealthy competition,\" Budi said.\n\n\"We're not here to protect e-commerce, but we protect small and medium enterprises. There are millions we must protect,\" the minister said.\n\nJakarta will also block any investment by Temu in local e-commerce if it makes such a move, Budi said, adding he has not heard of any such plan.\n\nBudi also said the government plans to request a similar block for Chinese shopping service Shein.\n\nTemu, Shein, Apple and Google did not respond to requests to comment. Temu can still be downloaded in app stores in Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia forced China's ByteDance social media platform TikTok to close its e-commerce service in the country last year to protect local merchants and users' data.\n\nMonths later, TikTok agreed to buy a majority stake in Indonesian tech conglomerate GoTo's e-commerce unit in order to stay in Southeast Asia's biggest e-commerce market.\n\nOn Tuesday, Indonesian homegrown e-commerce Bukalapak.com denied reports about an acquisition plan by Temu.\n\nIndonesia's e-commerce industry is set to expand to about $160 billion by 2030 from $62 billion in 2023, according to a report by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and consultancy Bain & Co.\n\n(Reporting by Ananda Teresia; Editing by Kim Coghill)",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI News You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\n\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\n\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee recently downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy with a price target of $205. In an investor note to clients, the analyst said the advisory was positive on the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence as Apple was the only hardware-software integrated player that could leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services. However, per Lee, smartphone hardware needed rework before being capable of serious AI with a likely timeline of 2026/27. The high expectations for iPhone 16/17 were premature, contended the analyst. The analyst further noted the expectations of 5% to 10% unit growth for the iPhone were unlikely to be met.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "While there are a number of prominent money managers on Wall Street, none are followed as closely by the investment community as Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett.\n\nOne reason investors gravitate to the Oracle of Omaha is his track record. Though he's not infallible, Buffett has overseen a nearly 5,500,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s. On an annualized total return basis, which includes dividends, Berkshire Hathaway has practically doubled up the return of the benchmark S&P 500 spanning six decades. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe other lure for investors is Buffett's willingness to be an open book. Whether through his annual letter to shareholders or during Berkshire's annual meetings, Buffett often shares the characteristics he looks for in \"wonderful companies,\" as well as offers his take on the American economy.\n\nBut what Warren Buffett might be best known for is his penchant for value investing. There's little that puts a smile on his face more than being able to put his company's capital to work in a time-tested company with a sustainable moat at an advantageous price.\n\nThough there are plenty of examples of the Oracle of Omaha nabbing amazing value stocks throughout history, there's one stock he keeps buying regardless of valuation.\n\nWarren Buffett has a knack for finding amazing deals hiding in plain sight\n\nDespite selling more than 500 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) between Oct. 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's top holding represents the perfect example of Warren Buffett stumbling on an amazing company at a highly favorable price point.\n\nWhen Buffett began building his company's stake in Apple during the first quarter of 2016, the tech giant's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio ranged from 10 to 12, which was well below that of the S&P 500. With the exception of the dot-com bubble, Apple's stock had never been cheaper.\n\nWhile its iPhone has remained dominant, in terms of domestic smartphone market share, Apple's growth has been spearheaded by its Services division. This is a subscription-driven segment designed to keep users loyal to its ecosystem of products and services. It should also improve the company's operating margin over the long run, as well as lessen the revenue peaks and troughs associated with iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nToday, Apple is hardly a bargain. As of the closing bell on Oct. 8, Apple's stock was valued at a multiple of more than 34 times TTM earnings per share (EPS). Although Buffett hinted during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May that paring down his company's stake in Apple was done for tax purposes, it's quite possible valuation also came into play.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's No. 3 holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), serves as another example of Warren Buffett pouncing on a time-tested business that was historically inexpensive.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, Buffett invested $5 billion into BofA to shore up its balance sheet and received preferred stock and warrants in return. When this investment was announced in August 2011, Bank of America was trading at less than 38% of its book value. Something of an unwritten rule on Wall Street is to buy high-quality bank stocks at or below their book value and unload them at or near two times book value.\n\nIn the years since the financial crisis, Bank of America has been able to put its legal issues firmly in the rearview mirror. What's more, it's benefited immensely from being the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks. The 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve between March 2022 and July 2023 added billions of dollars in net interest income to BofA's bottom line.\n\nBut with Bank of America stock now trading at a 16% premium to its book value, it's perhaps no surprise that more than $10 billion in BofA stock has been unloaded by Buffett since mid-July.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is unwavering in his desire to get a good deal -- with one exception. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the only stock Buffett keeps buying, regardless of its valuation\n\nDespite spending a small fortune to build up Berkshire Hathaway's stakes in Apple, Bank of America, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum, there's one stock that dwarfs them all, in terms of the amount of money Warren Buffett has invested.\n\nHowever, investors aren't going to find this company listed in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs. This is the filing that provides investors with a concise snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest money managers have been buying and selling.\n\nRather, investors will have to dig into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results to find evidence of Buffett purchasing his favorite stock. Toward the end of each quarterly filing, just prior to the executive certifications, you'll find the page that lists Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase activity -- because the stock Buffett keeps buying, regardless of valuation, is shares of his own company.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's share buyback program has evolved quite a bit since the midpoint of 2018. Prior to July 2018, buybacks were only allowed if Berkshire Hathaway's stock fell to or below 120% of its book value. Since Berkshire's stock never fell below this line-in-the-sand threshold, Buffett was never able to spend a penny on buybacks.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's board amended the rules governing buybacks to allow Warren Buffett and then right-hand man Charlie Munger (who passed away in November 2023) more freedom to execute buybacks. These simplified new rules allowed for indefinite share repurchases with no end date as long as:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and Warren Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap.\n\nThere's a lot of leeway with this second point, which is what allows Buffett to regularly buy back his company's stock. Since July 2018, Buffett has spent close to $78 billion repurchasing shares of Berkshire Hathaway, including $345 million during the June-ended quarter.\n\nAdditionally, buybacks have been made in all 24 quarters (through June 30, 2024) since these new repurchase rules were enacted. You'd have to go back to 2008 to find the last time Berkshire Hathaway's stock was as pricey as it is now, relative to its book value... and yet Buffett keeps buying! BRK.A Price to Book Value Chart\n\nBecause Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, conducting buybacks is the easiest way for Buffett to reward his company's shareholders and incent long-term thinking. Steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term investors.\n\nTo boot, companies with steady or growing net income, like Berkshire, tend to enjoy an EPS boost with fewer shares outstanding. This can make their stock more attractive to investors.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway sitting on an all-time record $276.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, as of the end of June, the Oracle of Omaha has every incentive to keep buying back his company's stock, regardless of valuation.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Most Popular Stock Among Mutual Funds According To Goldman Sachs?",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ List Of Stocks Popular With Mutual Fund Managers: Top 20 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks among the list of stocks that mutual funds are buying according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAs the fourth quarter of 2024 starts, the market is once again back to debating about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. The latter half of September saw some much overdue optimism on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve kicked off its rate cut cycle through a 50 basis point cut. Since the day of the rate cut and the close of September, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ index gained 2.6% and 3.5% respectively.\n\nHowever, the start of October saw the return of nervousness that investors have been dealing with since the start of the rate hiking cycle and worries of a recession. The S&P and the NASDAQ dropped by 1.1% and 1.5% after labor market data saw the US market add 254,000 in nonfarm payrolls and 8.040 million overall jobs measured by the Labor Department’s JOLTS survey. Both of these releases beat economist expectations, leading to sharp drops in markets as investors now factored out a 50 basis point cut at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe latest drops despite a strong labor market are indicative of how investors expect nothing but a perfectly balanced data set since in August, Magnificent 7 stocks, which are generally dependent on robust discretionary and corporate spending, lost $800 billion in market value after unemployment jumped by 4.3% in July for its highest value since September 2021.\n\nHowever, even though markets pared back their gains in October, the fact still remains that drops due to a strong labor market are nevertheless better than ones that follow a slow market. This is because the former scenario promises a robust economic outlook. Soon after the fresh labor data that caused jitters in October, investment bank Goldman Sachs was out with yet another 2024 target for the benchmark S&P index. The bank now expects the S&P to close 2024 at 6,000 points, a sizeable bump over its first 2024 target of 4722 points, with the latest estimate being its fourth revision of the 2024 target so far. The first revision saw the bank bump up 2024’s S&P closing estimate to 5,100 points in late 2023, and two subsequent revisions saw further upside as it predicted that the index would close out at 5,200 and 5,600 points.\n\nThe latest revision now sees the bank estimate that the index will close at 6,000 points – for a 4.3% upside over the recent closing value of 5,751 points. It is based on the bank’s optimism about the third quarter earnings cycle, as the index revision was followed by an upward earnings revision as well. Heading into earnings, Goldman believes that in 2025, the S&P’s earnings per share will now sit at $268. This is a 4.7% upward revision from the bank’s previous estimate of $256 and it assumes that earnings will grow by 11.2% next year over the 2024 earnings estimate of $241. This isn’t the only growth estimate in the banks’ latest market outlook since the report also sees it introduce an S&P earnings target for 2026. As per Goldman, in 2026, the S&P will deliver earnings per share of $288 to mark a 7.4% annual growth and a stronger 19.5% growth over this year’s earnings.\n\nFor a market that first struggled with worries of a recession in August and is now re calibrating expectations for the interest rate cut cycle, it’s important to see what’s driving the bank’s optimism. Led by chief US equity strategist David Kostman, analysts have built their optimism on the back of strong economic performance. In the note, Kostin comments that his firm’s “forward EPS estimates reflect a steady macro outlook.” He adds that “the primary driver of the upward revision to our 2025 EPS estimate is greater margin expansion,” since the “macro backdrop remains conducive to modest margin expansion, with prices charged outpacing input cost growth.” This backdrop, as you might expect, is driven by bullish expectations about the US economy. As per Kostin, the 2025 EPS estimate is driven by Goldman’s assumption that “sales will grow by 5%, roughly in line with nominal GDP growth (vs 4% previously).”\n\nYet, despite the optimism, the analysts are also wary about short term turbulence in the stock market. October is the last month before a hotly contested US presidential election, and investors have also felt jitters from ongoing hostilities in the Middle East. Consequently, Kostin warns that as “everyone is in the pool” right now, with the election looming and the mutual fund fiscal year ending on October 31st, stocks could see some shifts as the big players rotate their positions. As an example of the volatility that the market is facing right now, the analyst points out that the Chicago Board’s CBOE volatility index jumped by 30% over the past five trading days to signal that “volatility is no longer the coach on the sidelines: it is the player on the field.”\n\nSpeaking of mutual funds, they’ve done quite well this year. We took a look at the brief performance of mutual funds as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Top Fund Manager Stock Picks: 25 Best Overweight Stocks. This revealed that as per BofA, during the first quarter, 64% of actively managed mutual funds beat their benchmarks during Q1, for their best set of performance over the past 17 years. This also marked a significant improvement over last year’s performance when 38% of these funds had beaten the benchmarks.\n\nThe Fed’s interest rate cut also means that hedge fund shifted their positions. Financial services firms and banks in particular benefit from interest rate cuts as their deposit costs drop and they can earn more by maintaining existing rates. Consequently, according to Goldman, in the week before the Fed interest rate cut, hedge funds bought banks and financial services stocks at the fastest pace since 2023. This falls in line with what UBS Wealth Management’s Brad Bernstein shared in his comments after the rate cut when he explained that lower rates make financials attractive since “the improving yield curve for their balance sheet and what that means for their ability to lend at higher rates and pay cheaper rates on cash savings.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of Goldman Sachs’ top stocks that are popular with mutual fund managers, we used the bank’s list of 20 Russel 1000 stocks that mutual fund managers had grown their positions in during Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked by the number of funds that increased their portfolio allocation versus those that had decreased it.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nAn investor confidently checking stock market fluctuations on a laptop computer.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of  Mutual Funds: 31\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer technology company that is a global giant. Its best selling and most valuable product is the iPhone lineup. The iPhone is responsible for 52% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s sales, and the firm’s hypothesis is dependent on its ability to generate stable revenue through regular upgrade cycles. Its resources, as evidenced by a whopping $28.3 billion in cash and equivalent also mean that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is able to continuously innovate its product lineup. The biggest example of this is the MacBook lineup where the firm has successfully replaced x86 processors made by Intel with its custom chips. This has allowed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to de link its supply chain from an unreliable partner and benefit from tighter ecosystem control. However, the firm’s reliance on the iPhone means that if the phone disappoints, its shares tumble. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock lost 3% in mid September after an analyst note speculated that 2024 iPhone sales were lower over its predecessor over the year ago comparable period.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks popular with mutual fund managers according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) once nearly ran out of cash 24 years ago, during the dot-com bubble crisis of 2000. It was once reportedly left with just 10 months of cash, with its stock price plunging to $7 from $107.\n\nFast forward to 2024, Amazon is expected to have nearly as much cash on its balance sheet as rivals Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) combined by 2027.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nWhat Happened: Amazon is projected to amass $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments by the end of the year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, reported Business Insider.\n\nThis figure surpasses the cash reserves of tech giants Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft, which stand at $112.8 billion and $108.1 billion, respectively.\n\nBy 2027, Amazon’s cash reserves are expected to approach $400 billion, a significant shift for a company traditionally focused on reinvestment rather than cash accumulation.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nWall Street is now speculating whether Amazon will follow in the footsteps of other tech companies by returning some of this cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.\n\nApple is projected to have a cash pile of $106.51 billion, while Microsoft is expected to amass $300.88 billion, putting the combined total at $407.39 billion for two of the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nFor context, during the dot-com bubble crash in 2000, Amazon's stock plummeted and the company's cash reserves were falling, too. Bezos, though, was unfazed. \"Well, we are a famously unprofitable company,\" he said.\n\n\"And that is a conscious strategy and an investment decision.\"\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nWhy It Matters: Amazon’s increasing cash reserves come at a time when the company is making strategic moves to bolster its market position.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a significant investment in Amazon, purchasing 76,505 shares despite concerns about the company’s growth trajectory. This move followed a Wells Fargo downgrade, citing slowing growth and increased competition.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is preparing for the holiday season by boosting its workforce by 250,000 to meet the demands of the retail surge. This hiring spree highlights Amazon’s commitment to maintaining its competitive edge in the retail sector.\n\nAs Amazon’s cash reserves grow, the company faces pressure to balance reinvestment strategies with potential shareholder returns, a decision that could significantly impact its future financial trajectory.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

        "title": "One Tech Tip: Here's what you need to do before and after your phone is stolen or lost",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Phones hold so much of our digital lives — emails, social media and bank accounts, photos, chat messages and more — that if they ever get stolen or go missing, it can cause major disruption beyond just the loss of a device.\n\nIn some places, phone thefts have surged so much it's now an everyday problem, with thieves on electric bikes snatching them out of pedestrians' hands, swiping them off restaurant tables or pickpocketing them on the subway.\n\nIn Britain, where 200 phones are stolen every day in “snatch thefts,” the government has pledged to crack down on the crime and is meeting with tech companies and device makers to come up with solutions.\n\nHere are steps you can take before and after your phone goes missing:\n\nBasic protections\n\nThere are things you can do to make it less painful if your phone is stolen. Because some of these features are more technical in nature, people often overlook them.\n\nLock down as much as you can. At a minimum, require a password or biometric scan to unlock the device. You can also add similar requirements to important individual apps — like your banking account, WhatsApp or Signal — to protect your finance or chats from thieves.\n\nAlso, activate the find my device feature, which is available for both iOS and Android. Samsung also offers its own service called SmartThings Find.\n\nYou'll probably have lots of precious photos saved on your camera roll. It's a good idea to back them up, along with contacts, calendar items and other files. Google and Apple offer cloud-based backup services, although the free versions have limited storage space. You can also back up your files to an external hard drive, memory card or a laptop.\n\nSome police forces and phone companies advise turning off message previews, which prevents thieves trying to break into your accounts from seeing reset or login codes when the phone is locked. To do this on an iPhone, for example, go to the notifications section of your settings menu, and tap Show Previews.\n\nTurn on newer features\n\nRecent iOS and Android updates include a number of new functions designed to make thefts less attractive.\n\nIPhone users can turn on Stolen Device Protection, which makes it a lot harder for phone thieves to access key functions and settings. Many thieves will want to wipe the data off and reset so they can resell it, but with this feature on, they'll need a face or fingerprint scan to do so. Apple also recently updated its “ activation lock ” feature to make it harder for thieves to sell parts from stolen phones.\n\nAndroid phones, meanwhile, can now use use artificial intelligence to detect motion indicating someone snatched it out of your hand and is racing away on foot or a bike, and then lock the screen immediately. And there's a feature called Private Spaces that lets you hide sensitive files on your phone.\n\nStory continues\n\nJot down your device number\n\nTake note of your phone's serial number, also known as an IMEI number. It can link you to the phone if it does eventually get recovered. Call it up by typing (asterisk)#06# on your phone's keypad. If you’ve already lost your phone you can also find it in other places like the box it came in.\n\nIf its stolen\n\nIf you're unlucky enough to have your phone stolen, notify police. Call your insurance company if you have a policy that covers the device. Inform your phone company so they can freeze your number and issue a replacement sim card or esim. Notify your bank so they can watch out for suspicious transactions.\n\nTracking your device\n\nTry to locate your phone with find my device feature. For iPhones, go to iCloud.com/find from a web browser while Android users should head to www.google.com/android/find. Samsung also has its own service for Galaxy phones.\n\nThese services will show your phone's current or last known location on a map, which is also handy if you’ve just lost track of it somewhere in the house. Apple says even if a phone can't connect to the internet or has been turned off, it can use Bluetooth to ping any nearby Apple devices using the same network behind its AirTags tracking devices. Google says newer Pixel phones can be located “for several hours” after they've been turned off using similar technology.\n\nYou can get the phone to play a sound, even if it’s on silent. You can also put the phone in lost mode, which locks it and will display a message and contact details on the screen for anyone who finds it. Lost mode on iOS also suspends any Apple Pay cards and passes.\n\nIf the device shows up in an unfamiliar location on the map, and you suspect it has been stolen, experts say it's better to notify police rather than trying to get it back yourself.\n\nCybersecurity company Norton says, “Confronting a thief yourself is not recommended.\"\n\nFinal steps\n\nIf you can’t find your phone, there are some final steps to take.\n\nLog yourself out of all your accounts that might be accessible on the phone, and then remove it from your list of trusted devices that you use to get multifactor authentication codes — but make sure you can get those codes somewhere else, such as email.\n\nThen, as a last resort, you can erase the phone remotely so that there's no chance of any data falling into the wrong hands. However, take note: Apple says that if the iPhone is offline, the remote erase will only happens the next time it come back online online. But if you find the phone before it gets erased, you can cancel the request.\n\nGoogle warns that SD memory cards plugged into Android phones might not be remotely erased. And after the phone has been wiped, it won't show up on the Find My Device feature.\n\n___\n\nIs there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

        "title": "Cramer On Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): ‘Own It’",
        "content": "We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer on Netflix and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer.\n\nRecently, Mad Money’s host, Jim Cramer addressed what he called a “ridiculous plethora of sell-side downgrades,” noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.94%, the S&P 500 decreased by 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.18% on Monday. While he acknowledged the session’s poor performance, he cautioned that paying too much attention to downgrades can be detrimental for long-term investors.\n\nCramer urged investors not to get overly influenced by the negative sentiment on Wall Street and emphasized the importance of staying committed to strong companies, even when their stock prices experience volatility. He recounted the history of the bull market, stating:\n\n“When I look at the history of this incredible bull market, and it has been an incredible bull market, it’s littered with buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell, buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell. These downgrades scare you out of amazing stocks at levels that may temporarily be too high, but will recover later. If you listen to the downgrades, though, you’ll never recover with it.”\n\nIn discussing the challenges investors face, Cramer pointed out that many get rattled by analyst downgrades and might sell their shares in solid companies, which can make it difficult to buy back in later.\n\n“In the last decade, the toughest thing to do is to hold on to good stocks. But analysts and commentators love to take aim at big long-term winners. Their jeremiads have scared so many people out of some amazing gains.”\n\nHe observed that complacency can be prevalent on Wall Street, with bullish investors often overlooking risks while bearish ones miss out on potential opportunities. For those considering action based on a downgrade, Cramer advised waiting for a bounce to sell, but he noted that timing such moves is “incredibly hard,” even for seasoned traders.\n\nCramer emphasized that when analysts downgrade stocks that have already taken a hit and overlook positive aspects, it can create a challenging environment. However, he believes it is still possible to profit. Here’s what he said:\n\n“I need you to understand that when analysts downgrade after stocks have already been hammered, when really good investors ignore the positives, then, it may be a grim time. But not so grim that we can’t make money by focusing on the fundamentals of the companies. And not just the economy, the Fed, interest rates and oil.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 7 and October 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Cramer On Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): ‘Own It’\n\nCramer On Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): ‘Own It’\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a prominent designer and marketer of a diverse range of consumer electronics, including smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and wearables. Cramer discussed Jefferies’ recent downgrade of the stock, which included a mixed assessment.\n\nHe discussed that while the analysts expressed a long-term positive view of the company’s unique ability to integrate hardware and software for affordable AI services, they also highlighted that the smartphone hardware needs significant updates for advanced AI, potentially delaying progress until 2026 or 2027. Talking about the analysts’ report, he said:\n\n“Listen to this: ‘We like Apple Intelligence long term as Apple is the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.’\n\nSo far so good, right? Then, though, quick pivot to the negative: ‘Smartphone hardware needs rework before being capable of serious AI with likely timeline of 2026/27.’… Jeffries claims the high expectations for the iPhone 16 and 17 are premature and the price-to-earnings multiple is near an all-time high. And you know what? That’s all true.\n\nApple really is facing some near-term headwinds. The hardware may not be ready, but all this tells me is what everybody else has been saying for weeks now, real issues for the 16. When everyone knows there are real issues, though, you’re going to have a limited window to buy the stock after the expected post-quarter weakness. Unless you believe that nothing good will happen until 2026/27… If you believe that, it means that you think Tim Cook’s authorizing the sale of phones that he knows are substandard. It’s almost as though the entire history of Apple refusing to issue hardware before its time never happened. I mean, it’s like you can’t trust the guy. I say that’s some Joseph Stalin-level revisionist history for you. This downgrade is betting against Apple’s entire culture of excellence. Even when they argue that the valuation is too high, that presumes Apple’s service revenue stream gross margin bonanza will somehow taper off. I don’t buy it.”\n\nCramer also noted potential benefits from the Chinese government’s economic measures, given the company’s exposure to that market. He mentioned strong sales reported by T-Mobile and said:\n\n“Oh, and by the way, let’s remember [the] Chinese government finally training the bazooka on their flailing economy. It looks like their consumers will get some free money. That’s huge because Apple’s got a ton of exposure to China… With all the talk about the iPhone 16 disappointing, does it matter that T Mobile, one of the biggest sellers of the thing, told me personally that sales are good? I think it should matter… I say own it. Don’t trade it too hard.”\n\nIn 2023, the iPhone achieved a significant milestone by becoming the leading smartphone in the market, surpassing Samsung for the first time, according to IDC. Despite this achievement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) still held only 20% of all smartphone shipments last year, which points to considerable room for further growth. The introduction of new AI services and features could substantially increase the iPhone’s appeal and solidify its position in the competitive smartphone market.\n\nThe company has shown strong profitability, generating $101 billion in profit from $385 billion in revenue over the past year. In the latest quarter, service sales grew by 14.1%, reaching $24.2 billion, with this category enjoying a much higher gross margin of 74% compared to the 35.3% margin for products.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.”\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Bank of Nova Scotia marked a significant portfolio addition by acquiring 12,227 shares of Captivision Inc (NASDAQ:CAPT), a company based in the Republic of Korea. This transaction, categorized as \"New Holdings,\" was executed at a price of $3.72 per share. Despite the substantial number of shares purchased, this new holding represents a modest 0.04% of the firm's total portfolio, reflecting a strategic yet cautious investment approach.\n\nBank of Nova Scotia: A Profile\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CAPT.\n\nBank of Nova Scotia, headquartered at 44 King Street West, Toronto, is a prominent financial institution known for its diversified investment portfolio. The firm manages an equity portfolio worth $50.51 billion, with significant positions in technology and financial services sectors. Its top holdings include major corporations like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm's investment philosophy focuses on leveraging growth in these sectors to ensure robust returns. Bank of Nova Scotia's Strategic Acquisition of Captivision Inc Shares\n\nIntroduction to Captivision Inc\n\nFounded recently with its IPO on November 16, 2023, Captivision Inc, formerly known as Glaam Co Ltd, operates in the building materials industry. The company specializes in the innovative G-Glass technology, a transparent glass that can display media images, integrating ICT solutions with traditional building materials. Despite its groundbreaking product, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest $62.871 million. Bank of Nova Scotia's Strategic Acquisition of Captivision Inc Shares\n\nFinancial Health and Stock Performance\n\nCaptivision's financial metrics present a challenging picture. The company has a Return on Assets (ROA) of -271.95% and a concerning Altman Z score of -20.93, indicating significant distress. The stock's performance has been equally troubling, with a year-to-date price decline of 47.53%, and a GF Score of 11/100, suggesting poor future performance potential.\n\nMarket Context and Strategic Implications\n\nThe timing of Bank of Nova Scotia's investment coincides with a nearly 45.7% decline in Captivision's stock price since the transaction date, which might suggest a value-oriented purchase strategy aiming to capitalize on potential future recoveries. This acquisition aligns with the firm's history of investing in technology-driven companies, albeit at a notably cautious scale, possibly due to the high-risk profile of Captivision.\n\nFuture Outlook and Implications\n\nLooking ahead, Captivision Inc's innovative product line could position it for recovery and growth, particularly if it successfully capitalizes on the burgeoning market for smart building materials. For Bank of Nova Scotia, this investment, although small, could either represent a strategic foothold in an emerging market or a speculative play on Captivision's recovery potential. Investors and market watchers will undoubtedly keep a close eye on how this plays out in the evolving landscape of technology-integrated building solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe transaction's impact on Bank of Nova Scotia's portfolio is minimal at present, but its future implications could be more significant, depending on Captivision's operational turnaround and market penetration efforts. This move by Bank of Nova Scotia may well be a precursor to more substantial investments in similar technologies, reflecting a broader strategic shift towards innovative building materials.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have seen fantastic returns of 305% over the past five years",
        "content": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price has soared 292% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Meanwhile the share price is 1.2% higher than it was a week ago.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Apple achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 18% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 31% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this freereport showing consensus revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nWhen looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Apple the TSR over the last 5 years was 305%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nApple provided a TSR of 28% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 32% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for Apple you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this freelist of undervalued companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) TV+ will soon be available on Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Video, as streaming platforms continue to consolidate to resemble the cable offerings they’ve largely outcompeted.\n\nLater this month, Prime Video subscribers will be able to add Apple’s streaming service for $9.99 a month, adding to Amazon’s more than 100 existing add-on subscription options, the company said Wednesday.\n\n“As we continue to expand our offering and make it easy for customers to personalize their streaming experience directly in one app, we are proud to welcome Apple TV+ and its popular and critically-acclaimed shows, films and events to Prime Video,” said Mike Hopkins, senior vice president and head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nApple TV+ is home to popular series including Ted Lasso and The Morning Show, as well as movies and live sports.\n\nAmazon and Apple join other platforms in bundling their services to boost subscriptions and viewership. In July, Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced that they would offer a new bundle that combines all of their streaming platforms — Disney+, Hulu and Max — under one monthly subscription plan.\n\nDespite the influx of entrants into the streaming business, for many, it hasn’t yet been a profitable endeavor. They face steep competition, particularly from established streaming behemoth Netflix (NFLX).\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in February that he believes Prime Video could become a “large and profitable business,” The Wrap reported. In the second quarter, advertising revenue grew 20% year over year to $12.77 billion. The company also added ad tiers earlier this year, and has said it’s planning to ramp up its ad load in 2025.\n\nOther media giants have also been struggling to keep pace with the growing demands of the streaming market. Disney CEO Bob Iger acknowledgedin March thatnearly five years after its debut, the company’s streaming platform is still lagging behind the industry’s “gold standard” Netflix.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional cable companies are adding streaming offerings in an attempt to bolster their customer base. Charter Communications (CHTR), the parent company of Spectrum, announced earlier its month that it will offer its cable TV subscribers free access to Peacock (CMCSA), Disney+, Max, and others.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Chinese police have taken into custody four Taiwanese employees at Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple Inc.’s main assembly partner, the latest in a spate of detentions that have rattled investor confidence in the country.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Urban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\n\nPolice in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou detained the quartet on charges of breach of trust, according to a statement from Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council on Wednesday. Zhengzhou is where Hon Hai, the flagship company of Foxconn Technology Group, operates the world’s largest iPhone assembly plant.\n\nThe four employees are all Taiwanese, according to Elsie Tsai, spokeswoman for Taiwan’s semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation, which provides administrative support for Taiwanese with their affairs in China.\n\nThe employees have not damaged Hon Hai’s interest in any way, the council said in the statement, citing its understanding from the company. The incident could have been a result of some local police officers abusing their power, according to the council.\n\nLocal media in Taiwan reported that the four Hon Hai employees were detained earlier this year.\n\nA Foxconn representative did not have immediate comment on Thursday, which is a holiday in Taiwan. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office also did not immediately respond to a faxed inquiry.\n\nIt’s unclear what exactly triggered the move. Foxconn’s iPhone plant in Zhengzhou — called “iPhone City” because it cranks out the majority of Apple’s marquee devices — is considered one of the country’s signature manufacturing projects. It employs hundreds of thousands and delivers a major boost to the economy of the land-locked province of Henan.\n\nLast year, Chinese regulators conducted tax audits and reviewed land use by Foxconn when company founder Terry Gou was bidding to become the leader of democratic, self-ruling Taiwan, which China sees part of its territory. Later in 2023, Chinese tax authorities handed out a 20,000 yuan ($2,800) fine to a Foxconn subsidiary for overstating expenses. It is still unclear whether Chinese regulators have completed their probe into Foxconn.\n\nBeijing has taken aggressive actions against the staff of foreign firms in recent years as tensions with the US and its allies mount, spurring concerns about the safety of employees at multinational firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn executive at Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc. was indicted for espionage in August.\n\nBefore that, Beijing fined US-based Mintz Group about $1.5 million for illegal data collection, months after officials raided its offices and detained five of its Chinese employees.\n\nMore similar incidents took place in 2023. American consultancy Bain & Co. said Chinese authorities questioned staff at its Shanghai office, and security officials publicized a raid at Capvision, a consulting firm with headquarters in New York and Shanghai, accusing the company of abetting espionage efforts by foreign forces.\n\nAuthorities also detained an executive and two former employees of WPP Plc, one of the world’s biggest advertising companies.\n\n--With assistance from Jing Li.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Musk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms China Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "From small to extraordinary: The effect of compounding in investing",
        "content": "Apple Inc. is an excellent example of compounding, writes Robert Gill. (Credit: Annice Lyn/Getty Images files)\n\nAs William Shakespeare wrote, “How poor are they that have not patience.”\n\nCompounding is one of the most elementary and popular investing strategies available to all levels of investors, from the most sophisticated pension funds to college students opening their first investment account.\n\nHowever, taking advantage of the benefits that compounding yields takes a considerable amount of both patience and conviction, which are characteristics that are found more naturally in some of us than in others.\n\nYou need to have the capacity to remain invested for the long-term — despite the volatile swings of the stock market — to have enough time to let compounding work its magic.\n\nHow does compounding work to build wealth\n\nThe foundation of compounding is simple: it multiplies savings or investments at an accelerated pace. Compounding is what happens when you earn returns on not just your original investment, but also on accumulated returns you receive over time.\n\nCompounding returns are returns calculated on both the initial principal and all of the previously accumulated increase in value of the shares. There’s one caveat: the returns you receive need to be reinvested and may not be withdrawn. You need to have some patience.\n\nAs Berkshire Hathaway’s legendary investor Charlie Munger liked to say, “The big money is not in the buying and the selling … but in the waiting.”\n\nOne of the beautiful things about compounding is that it is a powerful mechanism that works its magic regardless of how much money you start with. However, you will want to have some time.\n\nTime is what amplifies the impact of compounding. The greater the number of compounding periods, the larger the effect of compounding. This means that it is possible to achieve impressive returns without requiring a high degree of effort.\n\nIndeed, there is a misconception in investing that activity creates value. While this can be the case, often an investor would be better off if they refrain from taking action, and simply remain patient, giving the investment time to compound its value.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever patience isn’t the only characteristic required for compounding to occur; conviction and profitability are also essential ingredients.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett says that “the ideal business is one that earns very high returns on capital, and that keeps using lots of capital at those high returns. That becomes a compounding machine,” as you allow the business time to grow and evolve.\n\nIndeed, the rate of growth achieved through compounding can be so remarkable that it can bewilder the human mind.\n\nHard to imagine how explosive compound growth can be\n\nNoted physicist Alfred Bartlett has stated that, “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.”\n\nWhen growth rates double a few times or more, it means that you should be prepared for astronomical growth. The full implications of such explosive growth are difficult to grasp, particularly as compounding picks up momentum and growth becomes exponential.\n\nNevertheless, examples of exponential growth are visible all around us, and increasingly so: English economist Thomas Malthus addressed the problem of exponential human population growth as early as 1798.\n\nBut there are many more recent examples. Consider computing power, energy consumption, internet communication traffic and data storage. These are all examples of exponential growth.\n\nIt is the role of investors to ensure their portfolio benefits from some exposure to such exponential growth.\n\nNow let’s take a look at an astounding example of how long-term compound growth has led to some impressive wealth creation.\n\nTake Apple stock as an example\n\nApple Inc. has the distinction of being not only one of the most recognizable brands in the world, but also one of the world’s most valuable companies by market capitalization. The company happens to be an excellent example of compounding, and our firm has held it in our model portfolio for clients for close to two decades.\n\nSo let’s take a closer look. Apple had its initial public offering (IPO) in December, 1980, at $22 a share.\n\nThe stock has split five times since the IPO, and on one occasion in 2014 shares split seven-for-one.\n\nA stock split is when a company divides its stock into multiple shares, effectively lowering the price of each share without changing the company’s market value. Think of it as cutting a cake into smaller slices; the cake remains the same size but more people can enjoy a slice.\n\nNow stay with me as we do some simple math with Apple shares: If one share trading at $20 splits two-for-one, the result is two shares trading at $10. In the case of Apple, their shares have split so many times from their original $22 IPO price, that on a split-adjusted basis, Apple’s IPO share price was a mere $0.09. And that’s not all – the company paid quarterly dividends from April, 1987, to October, 1995, and again from July, 2012.\n\nThe result is that a $1,000 investment during the IPO in December, 1980, adjusted for stock splits and dividends, is worth about $5.6 million today. This extraordinary outcome is due to the astounding magic of patient compounding.\n\nThe concept of compounding is a cornerstone of prudent investing, offering many benefits, including growth of assets, steady returns, and lower commission fees.\n\nHowever, despite its many benefits, it’s essential for investors to be aware of the potential drawbacks of compounding, such as portfolio concentration, greater time monitoring your portfolio, and remembering that this is not an infallible investment strategy.\n\nWith the difficulty in finding stocks that are true long-term compounders, the best path for an educated investor may be to aim for a modest degree of compounding while primarily focusing on selecting a portfolio of high-quality investments.\n\nMoreover, as your financial situation becomes more complicated, you may want to seek some input from a professional when it comes to managing your investment portfolio.\n\nNevertheless, by carefully balancing the pros and cons of compounding and aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals and risk tolerance, investors can construct portfolios that offer a favorable risk-return profile over the long-term.\n\nRobert Gill is senior vice-president and portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel, which offers individual investors and institutions actively managed investment solutions and advice.

        "title": "Huawei's China smartphone sales in August beat Apple for first time in 46 months: report",
        "content": "Smartphone sales of Huawei Technologies on the mainland surpassed those of Apple in August - the first time in 46 months, according to a new report by research firm CINNO - as the US-sanctioned company continues to ride on the success of its 5G handset comeback last year.\n\nThat aligned with findings from government think tank China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, which reported a 12.7 per cent year-on-year decline in foreign smartphone shipments, including Apple's iPhone, in the same month. Those shipments fell to 1.87 million units in August, from 2.14 million a year earlier, as domestic smartphone shipments rose 26.7 per cent to 24.05 million during the same period.\n\nCINNO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nCompetition between Huawei and Apple in the world's biggest smartphone market has taken on new significance, as the Shenzhen-based telecommunications equipment giant has seen a revival of its handset business amid the US tech giant's recent struggles on the mainland.\n\nStrong demand for Huawei's high-end handset models, such as the Mate and Pura series, as well as foldable smartphones like the recently launched Mate XT, helped lift the firm's average selling price and wholesale revenue to record highs in the second quarter, according to TechInsights. It said China remains Huawei's core market, accounting for 89 per cent of its global smartphone shipments.\n\nChina's smartphone market has steadily gained momentum this year, with more consumers gravitating towards local brands. Huawei, which leads the market, had a 17.5 per cent share in the first half, when total domestic shipments exceeded 140 million units to grow 7.7 per cent from a year ago, according to data from research firm IDC.\n\nHuawei's Mate XT trifold 5G smartphone generated plenty of buzz last month, when it was released on the same day Apple's iPhone 16 series hit store shelves in almost 60 countries.\n\nAhead of the new iPhone's release, Apple fell out of the top-five smartphone vendor rankings in China during the second quarter. Apple's market share on the mainland shrank to less than 14 per cent, according to IDC.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant's revenue in the Greater China region - comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan - reached US$14.73 billion in the June quarter, down 6.5 per cent from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers inside an Apple Store in Shanghai when the iPhone 16 series was officially released in almost 60 countries on September 20, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Customers inside an Apple Store in Shanghai when the iPhone 16 series was officially released in almost 60 countries on September 20, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nApple's iPhone assembly orders mostly remained unchanged from previous market estimates, according to Kuo Ming-chi, an Apple-focused analyst at TF International Securities.\n\n\"Suppliers had been asked to continue producing two [iPhone 16] Pro models during China's National Day holiday, indicating that demand for the Pro models has generally met expectations so far,\" Kuo wrote in an X post on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Apple chief executive Tim Cook had expressed confidence over the firm's long-term prospects in China, mainland consumers' enthusiasm for the iPhone 16 has suffered because Apple Intelligence - the firm's on-device artificial intelligence (AI) system - will not be available in the Chinese language until next year. Generative AI systems are also heavily regulated in the country.\n\n\"The next focus will be the impact on US market demand [or] shipments after Apple Intelligence becomes available in late October,\" Kuo said. He maintains his previous production estimate for the iPhone 16 series at 88 million to 89 million units in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\n\nApple will begin selling TV+ subscriptions through Prime later this month, Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Amazon Prime Video, said Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles.\n\n“What we offer channel partners is hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world,” Hopkins said. “Having this engagement around the world with Prime Members accessing Prime Video is a real great platform for other partners to be able to reach them.”\n\nAmazon markets more than 100 streaming services via its channels store, enabling customers to watch shows from Max, Paramount+ and Hallmark within Prime Video. Those services rely on Amazon to expand their audience.\n\nApple TV+ was one of the only major streaming services not available in the store, along with Netflix and Walt Disney Co.’s main properties. Those two are among the few with streaming services that have more viewers than Prime Video.\n\nApple has invested billions of dollars in original programming over the last few years, earning industry awards and critical praise. But its streaming service has yet to attract as many subscribers as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nThe agreement expands an existing relationship between the companies. In 2017, Amazon started offering a Prime Video app on the Apple TV set-top box, while Prime Video is integrated into the Apple TV app across the iPhone maker’s device lineup.

        "content": "Legendary Apple Co-Founder Steve Jobs Once Said, 'Being The Richest Man In The Cemetery Doesn't Matter To Me:' Maybe That's Why...\n\nIt’s been over a decade since legendary Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs left us, but his impact on the world of technology and beyond continues to resonate.\n\nOn Oct. 5, the anniversary of his passing, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect on the journey of this tech visionary who transformed not just how we use computers, but how we live our daily lives.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nThe Early Days: A Spark Of Genius\n\nJobs’ story begins in San Francisco, where he was born in 1955 and later adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. From an early age, he showed a keen interest in electronics, tinkering with gadgets in his family’s garage.\n\nAs a teenager, Jobs’ rebellious spirit and thirst for knowledge led him to Reed College. Though he dropped out after just one semester, he continued to audit classes that piqued his interest.\n\nOne of these was a calligraphy course, which might seem like an odd choice for a future tech mogul. But Jobs later credited this class with influencing Apple’s groundbreaking approach to typography and design.\n\nSee Also: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\n\nMost Valuable Company Today Had Humble Beginnings\n\nThe story of Apple’s humble beginnings in a garage has become the stuff of Silicon Valley legend.\n\nIn 1976, Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Company. Their first product, the Apple I, was essentially a circuit board that hobbyists could use to build their own computers.\n\nHowever, the Apple II, released in 1977, really put them on the map.\n\nThe Apple II wasn’t just a computer for geeks – it was a machine that regular people could use.\n\nApple today has a market capitalization of $3.448 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nTrending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nThe Macintosh Revolution\n\nFast forward to 1984, and Apple was ready to change the world again with the Macintosh.\n\nThis was the first commercially successful computer to feature a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse.\n\nIf you’ve ever used a computer with icons and windows (which, let’s face it, is pretty much every computer nowadays), you can thank Jobs and his team for pushing this revolutionary idea into the mainstream.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut It Was Not Always Smooth Sailing\n\nIn 1985, after a power struggle with then-CEO John Sculley, Jobs left Apple, the company he had co-founded. It was a huge blow, but Jobs wasn’t one to sit idle.\n\nHe went on to found NeXT, a company that aimed to create high-end computers for the education market. While NeXT didn’t achieve the commercial success Jobs had hoped for, it would later play a crucial role in Apple’s future.\n\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\n\nFrom Side Project To Animation Powerhouse\n\nDuring his time away from Apple, Jobs also bought a little computer graphics division from Lucasfilm. This would become Pixar Animation Studios.\n\nUnder Jobs’ guidance, Pixar went from a tech company to an animation powerhouse, releasing groundbreaking films like “Toy Story” and forever changing the landscape of animated storytelling.\n\n...And Then The Prodigal Son Returns\n\nBy the mid-90s, Apple was struggling. The company that had once been at the forefront of personal computing was floundering, with a confusing product line and declining sales.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Apple announced that it was acquiring NeXT in 1996, bringing Jobs back into the fold as an advisor.\n\nHe quickly became interim CEO (or “iCEO” as he jokingly called himself) and set about turning the company around.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n\nThe Apple Renaissance\n\nJobs’ return to Apple marked the beginning of one of the greatest comebacks in business history. He streamlined the product line, focusing on simplicity and design.\n\nThe result? A string of iconic products that would redefine entire industries:\n\nThe iMac (1998): A colorful, all-in-one computer that made technology fun and accessible. The iPod (2001): Not the first MP3 player, but the one that made digital music mainstream. The iPhone (2007): A device that put the internet, a music player, and a phone in your pocket, changing the way we communicate forever. The iPad (2010): Bridging the gap between smartphones and laptops, creating a new category of device.\n\nTrending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nThe Jobs Philosophy\n\nWhat set Jobs apart wasn’t just his ability to create great products, but his unwavering commitment to certain principles:\n\nSimplicity: Jobs believed that technology should be intuitive and easy to use.\n\nDesign: He saw beauty in minimalism and insisted that even the parts users couldn’t see should be well-designed.\n\nIntegration: Jobs pushed for seamless integration between hardware and software, creating ecosystems that just worked.\n\nHe once said, \"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful [at Apple], that’s what matters to me.\"\n\nThe Final Chapter\n\nIn 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Despite this setback, he continued to lead Apple, overseeing some of the company’s most innovative years.\n\nHowever, his health struggles eventually led to him stepping down as CEO in Aug. 2011.\n\nOn Oct. 5, 2011, he passed away, leaving behind a legacy that had fundamentally changed multiple industries – computing, music, movies, telecommunications, and retail.\n\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nThe Legacy Lives On\n\nToday, Apple continues to be one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies. While it has evolved under the leadership of Tim Cook, many of Jobs’ core principles still guide the company.\n\nBut Jobs’ influence extends far beyond Apple. His vision of technology as a tool to enrich our lives has shaped the entire tech industry. From the smartphones we carry in our pockets to the way we consume media, Jobs’ fingerprints are everywhere.\n\nHe once said, “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” He was certainly one of those people, and the world is all the richer for it.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next:\n\nStudies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\n\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States​. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\n\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\n\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Unlike other hyperscalers, Apple has not pledged a lot of money towards building AI data centers, but has instead focused on developing the chips needed to power these data centers. Even though Apple announced plans to spend nearly $430 billion in capital expenditures over a five year period ending in 2026, most of this capital is geared towards direct spending on US-based suppliers, capital expenditures in the US, and other projects, including dozens of Apple TV productions, per news platform Bloomberg. However, the most significant Apple investment in data centers by far is the Apple Chips in Data Center Project. Under this project, the firm is working with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to design and produce data center chips.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple’s Dan Riccio, Key Executive in Both the Jobs and Cook Eras, to Retire",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s Dan Riccio, who oversaw the company’s push into mixed-reality headsets and previously served as its hardware engineering chief, is retiring.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters? From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\n\nThe veteran executive, a vice president who reports to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, is leaving Apple this month, according to people with knowledge of the move. Employees in Riccio’s Vision Products Group, which includes a couple thousand engineers working on headsets and related technology, were told they would become the responsibility of John Ternus, Apple’s hardware boss.\n\nMike Rockwell, Riccio’s current lieutenant, will continue to lead the Vision Products Group on a day-to-day basis, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes aren’t public. A spokesperson for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment.\n\nRiccio’s exit marks one of the most significant departures from Apple’s management team — though it’s been in the making for some time. Three years ago, he switched from being a senior vice president to a vice president and left the 12-person executive team, a step toward his eventual retirement.\n\nThe executive spent 26 years at the company and was known at times for an abrasive style and controversial moves, but he also made key hires and encouraged acquisitions that resulted in major new products. His tenure included overseeing some of Apple’s biggest bets, including development of the Vision Pro headset and the failed bid to make a car.\n\nSince stepping down from the top hardware engineering post in early 2021, Riccio has led the Vision Products Group, or VPG, which includes the Vision Pro work. He was one of the biggest advocates for the device and served as a bridge between the group and Apple’s top executive team.\n\nTurning the Vision Pro into a hit has been an uphill fight for Apple. The headset, which melds augmented and virtual reality, was plagued by problems with weight, overheating and a high price. But it’s still seen as a stepping stone toward more commercially successful devices.\n\nOther projects struggled to even get to the product stage. When Riccio ran Apple’s hardware division, he led Apple’s push into self-driving cars, an endeavor that was abandoned this year. An earlier attempt to make Apple television sets was shuttered nearly a decade ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Apple also brought several major devices to market under Riccio’s watch, including AirPods, the iPad Pro and the first large-screen iPhones. Riccio became Apple’s hardware chief in 2012 upon the exit of Bob Mansfield. When Riccio left that job, he was replaced by Ternus.\n\nRiccio’s transition to a smaller role in recent years fits a pattern for Apple. After Phil Schiller stepped down as head of marketing in 2020, he remained in charge of the App Store. And the company is trying a similar tack with Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, who is leaving his job at the end of this year but staying on to oversee real estate and information security efforts.\n\nRiccio was a key player under Steve Jobs before Cook took over in 2011, and his departure represents one of the biggest changes since the 2019 exit of design guru Jony Ive. A larger shake-up still lies ahead. Many members of Apple’s management team are nearing retirement age at the same time, including Cook, who turns 65 next year.\n\nBloomberg News reported in March that Riccio, who joined Apple in 1998 as a director in its product design group, was nearing retirement. Dan Rosckes, Apple’s procurement chief, is also retiring imminently, Bloomberg reported this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMusk Reveals Why He’s Jumping Into Trump’s Arms How Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession Rate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy Hamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "content": "Is The iPhone Losing Its Buzz Among Teens? Piper Sandler Finds Out\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Matt Farrell surveyed around 13,500 teens to see Apple Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone upgrade expectation among them.\n\nNotably, Apple unveiled the iPhone 16 in September, and early pre-order data shows that demand for the iPhone 16 may be lower than expected due to a lack of reasons for existing iPhone owners to upgrade to the latest model.\n\nThe analyst’s survey results indicate that 22% of teens plan to upgrade to an iPhone 16 this Fall/Winter, slightly down from 23% in Fall 2023 and 24% in Fall 2022. However, this is an increase from 20% in the Spring 2024 survey, adds the analyst.\n\nAs per the Fall 2024 survey, Farrell notes that 87% of teens owned an iPhone, consistent with historical levels. Additionally, 88% of teens expect their next phone to be an iPhone, aligning with recent survey trends.\n\nMoreover, the analyst writes that only about 30% of teens intend to upgrade any Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which seems low considering their enthusiasm.\n\nRelated: Apple iPhone 16 Selling At A ‘Greater Rate Than Last Year,’ Says T-Mobile CEO Amid Reports Of Lower Demand: ‘People Are Buying Pros, They’re Buying Maxs...They’re Buying Up The Food Chain’\n\nThe analyst notes that the average iPhone among teens is roughly three generations behind the iPhone 16, suggesting these older models may be overdue for an upgrade.\n\nIn addition, Farrell says that over 70% of teens own AirPods, and 25% plan to purchase them in the next six months.\n\nAlso, more than 30% of teens surveyed own an Apple Watch or iPad, adds the analyst.\n\nThe analyst rated the company Neutral with a price target of $225.\n\nAlso Read: Apple Revenue Growth ‘Just Too Slow For Investors To Get Excited About’: Analyst Highlights Advertising As Future Catalyst\n\nPrice Action: AAPL shares are up 1.22% at $228.52 at the last check Wednesday.\n\nImage via Unsplash\n\nRead Next:\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Boosts Sales, But Base Models Lag, Analyst Says\n\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Equal-Weight Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Strong Buy Jan 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "title": "Analyst: Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 Holiday Sales Hopes At Risk Amid ‘Disappointing Sell-Throughs’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year “well beyond” 5,700.\n\n“Bull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that’s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.”\n\nLee said that he’s inclined to buy “risks outright” as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\n“Small caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.”\n\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may have reduced its iPhone 16 production for the December quarter by 3 million units, according to a supply chain check by Barclays. Analysts Tim Long and George Wang noted, “We believe AAPL may have cut roughly 3M units at a key semiconductor component for the Dec-Q, which, if confirmed, would be the earliest build cut in recent history.”\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to roll out its Apple Intelligence features in the U.S. starting mid-October with the iOS 18.1 update. However, the Chinese-language rollout will not begin until 2025, with Europe seeing a similarly staggered introduction.\n\nBarclays believes iPhone shipments for the September quarter could reach 51 million units, assuming favorable channel fill. But the December quarter appears increasingly at risk due to recent order cuts, disappointing sell-throughs, a staggered Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout, limited AI adoption outside the U.S., and minimal hardware differentiation. The firm maintains its Underweight rating on Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "DOJ’s Google breakup remedy puts tech world on notice",
        "content": "The US Justice Department said in a new court filing that it may recommend a break up of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as an antidote to unhealthy competition in the search engine market, showing just how far Washington is willing to go to rein in Big Tech.\n\nDOJ lawyers used a 32-page document to outline a framework of options for DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta to consider, including \"behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search.\"\n\nGoogle in a blog post said that \"DOJ’s radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\"\n\nIts stock fell slightly in pre-market trading Wednesday.\n\nThe proposal is the first step from the Justice Department to break up a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nThat case — which the DOJ referenced in its Tuesday court filing — resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.\n\nThe move by DOJ also sends a signal to other tech giants currently facing antitrust cases from DOJ and other Washington regulators as part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nThe case against Google targeting its dominance in search resulted in a landmark decision in August, where DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta sided with DOJ and concluded Google illegally monopolized the online search engine market and the market for search text advertising. DOJ said in a new court document that it is considering a breakup of Google, among other options, as potential remedies in a landmark antitrust trial. A judge has to make the final decision. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nMehta concluded that Google’s agreements with browser providers and devices powered by Google’s Android operating system stifled rivals from entering and growing within the markets.\n\nIt will now be up to Mehta to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nDOJ is expected to provide a more detailed document by Nov. 20 outlining these remedies. But the 32-page document filed late Tuesday offers several points of focus beyond forcing Google to sell parts of its business.\n\nOne has to do with contracts that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said to prevent further harm they may seek to limit or terminate Google’s use of those contracts that use Chrome, Play and Android to advantage Google search, as well as \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products, potentially with or without the use of a choice screen.\" Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers the data that it uses to refine its search algorithms, and limit the company's dominance over search text ads.\n\nDOJ suggested the judge should also consider blocking Google from illegally monopolizing related markets, in addition to the search and search text advertising markets.\n\nIt may ask the judge to force Google to give websites more ability to \"opt out\" of \"any Google-owned artificial-intelligence product.\"\n\nGoogle pushed back on the DOJ's suggestions.\n\n“We believe that today’s blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Court’s decision about Search distribution contracts,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nGoogle faces antitrust challenges on other fronts. It is currently defending itself in a separate lawsuit from DOJ alleging a monopoly in the technology used to but and sell online ads.\n\nAnd earlier this week another federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store as part of the resolution of a suit brought by Epic Games Inc.\n\nDOJ cited that ruling in its Tuesday court filing that outlined a Google breakup as one possible remedy, noting that the judge in the Epic Games case said remedies should \"bridge to moat\" to combat network effects.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Deciding to Sell Shares of This Well-Known Stock",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) needs little introduction. In fact, the iPhone maker is now the most valuable company in the world thanks to anticipation for its new Apple Intelligence artificial intelligence (AI) platform and some recent weakness in the shares of rival Microsoft, which Apple replaced in the top spot.\n\nHowever, not every investor has been impressed with the tech giant, as a number of high-profile billionaires sold the stock in the second quarter, according to 13-F filings from the SEC. Let's take a look at three of the top investors who sold Apple stock, and what these sales may mean for you. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nNo investor gets more attention than Warren Buffett, and some investors were stunned when his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) conglomerate unloaded much of his stake in Apple, a company he's touted as \"probably the best business I know in the world.\"\n\nBuffett has also said he thinks of Apple as Berkshire's third business, after its wholly owned insurance and railroad subsidiaries.\n\nGiven Buffett's past comments on Apple, it might be surprising that Berkshire is dumping its shares of the iPhone maker, following a similar move in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway sold 389.4 million shares, or roughly half of its stake in the company, worth roughly $80 billion.\n\nIt wasn't clear why Berkshire decided to sell Apple stock. Buffett alluded to the threat of a higher capital gains tax rate, which seemed to have faded since earlier this year, and selling Apple does help to clear the deck for Berkshire's tax liability. Notably, Berkshire's keeping that money in Treasury bills rather than investing it in other stocks.\n\nBuffett's comments in Berkshire's shareholder letter show he believes the stock market is expensive, and he likely views Apple similarly as it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.\n\n2. D.E. Shaw\n\nDavid Shaw is the billionaire behind the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Shaw is a computer scientist known for investing strategy on math and algorithms called quantitative trading.\n\nD.E. Shaw was also a seller of Apple stock, shedding 4.8 million shares to raise roughly $1 billion. The hedge fund still has nearly 10 million shares of Apple stock.\n\nShaw has owned the stock since the first quarter of 2004, meaning the stock is up nearly 50,000% since the fund first started buying it. While it's unclear why D.E. Shaw is selling the stock, Apple's valuation likely played a role, and taking profits after a 20-year run makes sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's hard to fault the fund for selling the stock after a gain of nearly 500 times its initial investment.\n\n3. Susquehanna International Group\n\nBillionaire Jeff Yass of Susquehanna was also dumping shares of Apple in the second quarter. Like D.E. Shaw, Susquehanna is also known for its quantitative trading strategy, and that fund dumped 2.6 million shares of Apple stock in the second quarter, leaving it with 6.2 million shares.\n\nSusquehanna has also owned Apple stock for a long time, first buying it in the third quarter of 2008. In other words, it also has significant gains to cash in on, so it's not surprising to see it sell the stock now that its valuation is close to as high as it's been in modern history.\n\nShould you sell Apple?\n\nBefore you consider selling Apple, it's worth noting that all three of these billionaire-led funds still own some shares of Apple, and they've all held the stock for at least several years.\n\nAt this stage, Apple's potential gains seem more limited due to its valuation and market capitalization of around $3.5 trillion, but its economic moat remains as strong as ever, especially as Apple Intelligence looks set to entrench its installed base even further. Therefore, there's no need to sell Apple stock right now.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "Affirm shares jump in pre-market after Morgan Stanley upgrade to 'equal-weight'",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) rose 3.4% in pre-market trading on Wednesday after Morgan Stanley upgraded their rating on the stock, signaling renewed optimism around the company’s future prospects.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts upgraded Affirm to “equal-weight” from its prior “underweight” rating and raised their price target to $37 from $20.\n\nThe revision stems from the analysts' belief that Affirm has positioned itself to attract more affluent customers, a shift that could dramatically improve the company's growth trajectory.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s updated view flags three initiatives that Affirm has recently implemented to appeal to higher-income consumers.\n\nFirst, the integration of Affirm’s services with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Wallet, which became available in mid-September, allows Affirm to tap into Apple Pay’s typically wealthier user base.\n\nThe analysts project that this move alone could add nearly $2 billion in incremental transaction volumes by FY26, up from earlier estimates of $1.0 to $1.5 billion.\n\nThis partnership is particularly vital because Apple Pay users tend to be younger and higher-income, aligning well with Affirm’s goals of expanding its reach beyond its traditional customer base.\n\nSecond, Affirm has increasingly focused on offering 0% promotional financing in partnership with merchants and manufacturers.\n\nThese types of offers are highly attractive to high-income consumers, who are often more responsive to promotions tied to big-ticket purchases.\n\nThe analysts noted that Affirm's direct engagement with manufacturers is a smart move, as manufacturers are often more willing to subsidize promotional financing than merchants with slimmer margins.\n\nBy expanding these promotions, Affirm is expected to see higher usage rates among wealthier consumers, a key demographic that has been somewhat elusive for the company in the past.\n\nThird, Affirm is leveraging lower interest rates to offer more competitive pricing on its financing products. With the ability to reduce borrowing costs, Affirm can offer a wider range of promotional interest rates beyond 0%, such as 1.99% or 4.99%.\n\nThis flexibility enhances its appeal to more affluent customers who are accustomed to low-rate financing options. According to Morgan Stanley, these combined efforts in distribution, promotion, and pricing create a powerful toolset for Affirm to capture and retain higher-spend demographics, positioning the company for stronger long-term growth.\n\nThe upgrade is also supported by the easing regulatory pressure on the Buy Now, Pay Later industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has taken a more measured approach to the sector, noting that BNPL providers, including Affirm, are complying with new regulations regarding consumer protection.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis reduced regulatory risk, combined with Affirm’s enhanced consumer engagement strategies, has improved the company's outlook in the eyes of Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\nWhile Affirm has historically faced concerns about its customer base skewing towards lower-income, lower-credit-quality segments, Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe that the company’s recent moves mark a meaningful pivot toward a more lucrative customer demographic.\n\nThey also note that Affirm’s efforts to improve its underwriting practices and customer engagement are laying the groundwork for sustainable, long-term profitability.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s analysts acknowledge that while the stock’s recent rally has brought it closer to their new price target of $37, they see potential for continued upward estimate revisions as the company gains further traction with its new initiatives.\n\nThey cite upcoming earnings, particularly the next report in November, as the next key catalyst for the stock, which could provide further clarity on the success of these strategic shifts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAffirm shares jump in pre-market after Morgan Stanley upgrade to 'equal-weight'\n\nRio Tinto goes all in on lithium with $6.7 billion Arcadium buy\n\nBoeing halts talks, withdraws pay offer to union as strike drags on\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For almost 60 years, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been on a pedestal. During that time, he's watched his company grow into a trillion-dollar business, as well as delivered a cumulative return for his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that tops 5,600,000%!\n\nOne of the reasons the Oracle of Omaha is so widely followed on Wall Street -- aside from his company's outsized returns since the mid-1960s -- is his willingness to share the characteristics he looks for when putting Berkshire's capital to work. Buffett has regularly touted businesses with sustained moats, strong management teams, and exceptional capital-return programs. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut one of the unsung heroes of Buffett's long-term success has been portfolio concentration. Buffett and longtime right-hand man Charlie Munger, who passed away in November, long believed that their top ideas are deserving of more investment capital.\n\nDespite Berkshire Hathaway holding stakes in 43 stocks and two index funds, a whopping 67% ($210.4 billion) of the $315 billion portfolio Buffett oversees at his company is invested in just five unstoppable stocks.\n\nApple: $90.7 billion (28.8% of invested assets)\n\nEven though more than 500 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) have been sold by Buffett since the start of October 2023 -- potentially for tax purposes -- this tech goliath is still the far-and-away largest holding for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWhile Apple is lauded for its ultra-popular physical devices, including the iPhone, which holds a greater than 50% share of the domestic smartphone market, it's the company's Services segment that packs the most punch moving forward. A subscription service-driven operating model should steadily lift the company's operating margin over time, as well as help smooth out the revenue fluctuations that typically occur during iPhone replacement cycles.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha is also a big-time fan of Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since the start of 2013, Apple has bought back $700.6 billion worth of its common stock, which would be enough to buy all but nine of the 499 other S&P 500 components. These buybacks have reduced Apple's outstanding share count by more than 42% and boosted its earnings per share.\n\nAmerican Express: $41.8 billion (13.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe second-largest holding in the $315 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP). AmEx is the second-longest continuous holding for Berkshire Hathaway (since 1991).\n\nWhat's made American Express such a phenomenal stock to own for decades has been its ability to \"double dip.\" On one hand, AmEx is the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. This is to say that it's generating highly predictable processing fees from merchants. On the other hand, it's also a lender and is able to bring in annual fees and net interest income from its cardholders. During lengthy periods of economic growth, AmEx's ability to double dip is undeniably beneficial.\n\nFurthermore, American Express has a knack for attracting affluent clientele. High-earning individuals are less likely to alter their spending habits than the average-earning cardholder. In theory, this should help AmEx navigate economic turbulence better than most lenders.

Between July 17 and Oct. 2, the Oracle of Omaha has green-lit the sale of roughly 240 million shares of BofA, equating to around $9.8 billion. Nevertheless, it's still Berkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding.\n\nThe beautiful thing about bank stocks is their strong cyclical ties. Even though recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they're historically short-lived. Only three of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II have stuck around for 12 months, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months in length. By comparison, most economic expansions endure for multiple years. These lengthy periods of growth allow bank stocks like BofA to prudently grow their loan portfolios.\n\nBank of America has also been able to fully take advantage of the most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades. The 525-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate between March 2022 and July 2023 has added billions of dollars in net interest income to Bank of America's bottom line each quarter\n\nCoca-Cola: $28.1 billion (8.9% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, and the true definition of an unstoppable stock, is consumer staples juggernaut Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola, which has been a continuous holding for Berkshire since 1988, is providing Buffett's company with a whopping 60% dividend yield, relative to its cost basis.\n\nCoca-Cola's ongoing success is a reflection of its geographically diverse operations. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia, it's operating in every other country and has more than two dozen brands generating over $1 billion in annual sales. This level of geographic breadth allows Coca-Cola to generate predictable cash flow in developed markets, while moving the organic growth needle in faster-growing emerging markets.\n\nCoca-Cola's marketing is also top-notch. According to the annually released \"Brand Footprint\" report from Kantar, Coca-Cola has been the most-chosen brand by consumers for 12 consecutive years. Being able to lean on more than a century of history, as well as connect with a younger audience via digital media platforms, has made Coca-Cola one of the strongest and most easily recognized brands in the world.\n\nChevron: $17.9 billion (5.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe fifth unstoppable stock that, along with Apple, American Express, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola, cumulatively accounts for two-thirds of Berkshire Hathaway's $315 billion of invested assets, is integrated energy behemoth Chevron(NYSE: CVX).\n\nWarren Buffett doesn't have nearly $18 billion invested in this global oil and gas giant on a whim. A wager this large signifies an expectation that the spot price of crude oil will remain elevated or perhaps head even higher.\n\nMultiple years of reduced capital investment by energy majors (including Chevron) during the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, strongly suggests the supply of crude oil will remain tight for the foreseeable future. When the supply of an in-demand energy commodity is constrained, it's not uncommon for its spot price to benefit.\n\nAdditionally, the Oracle of Omaha likely appreciates the \"integrated\" aspect of Chevron's operations. Though it generates its juiciest margins from its upstream drilling segment, Chevron also owns transmission pipelines and downstream chemical plants and refineries. These segments generate predictable cash flow and can operate as a hedge in the event that the spot price of crude oil declines. In short, they're playing a key role in supporting Chevron's meaningful capital-return program.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "38.3% of Warren Buffett's $315 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Under Warren Buffett's leadership as CEO, the Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) investment company has delivered a compound annual return of 19.8% since 1965. That would have been enough to turn an investment of $1,000 back then into a whopping $44.7 million today. By comparison, the same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $338,311 over the same period. That's why investors closely monitor Berkshire's every move.\n\nThe conglomerate's success stems from Buffett's simple investment strategy: He likes companies with steady growth, robust profitability, strong management teams, and shareholder-friendly initiatives like stock buyback programs and dividend schemes. One thing Buffett and his team never do is chase the latest stock market trend, so you won't find Berkshire piling into red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nWith that said, three existing stocks in Berkshire's $315 billion portfolio of publicly listed securities are deploying AI into their legacy businesses in unique ways. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Amazon: 0.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nE-commerce is Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) core business, but the company is also home to the world's largest cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon is using AWS to build a dominant presence across the three core layers of AI:\n\nInfrastructure: AWS designed its own data center chips for AI development. One of them is called Trainium, which offers cost savings of up to 50% during the AI training process, compared to infrastructure powered by competing chips like those supplied by Nvidia. Large language models (LLMs): AWS developed a family of LLMs called Titan. Businesses can use them to accelerate the build-out of their own AI software applications. Titan LLMs are available on the Bedrock platform through AWS, along with a selection of other models from third-party AI start-ups like Anthropic. AI software: AWS offers a powerful AI virtual assistant called Q. It's capable of generating computer code to help developers accelerate their software projects, and businesses can also use it to extract valuable insights from their internal data.\n\nBut Amazon is also integrating AI into its e-commerce segment. It developed a virtual assistant called Rufus, which can answer shoppers' questions and even help them with product comparisons. Plus, Amazon launched Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers during the recent second quarter of 2024, which uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers. That could be a huge cost saver over the long term, because it will reduce the number of orders that are returned for a refund.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for failing to identify the opportunity sooner. Still, as long as Berkshire continues to hold the stock, it will likely benefit from Amazon's fast-growing presence in the AI space.\n\n2. Coca-Cola: 8.9% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest soda company, and it likes to experiment with technology to help improve efficiency, connect with customers, and create new opportunities to generate revenue. The company is now deploying AI in a variety of ways, and it even appointed a \"head of generative AI\" last year to oversee its efforts.\n\nSo far, Coca-Cola has used AI to craft marketing campaigns, and even to design a promotional version of its flagship soda. Coca-Cola Y3000 captures what the drink might taste like in the year 3000 by using AI to analyze mountains of customer data.\n\nBut back in April, Coca-Cola made its largest AI commitment to date. It agreed to spend $1.1 billion on Microsoft's Azure AI cloud services platform over five years, to help improve workplace productivity, supply chains, marketing, and more.\n\nBerkshire spent $1.3 billion building its stake in Coca-Cola stock between 1987 and 1994, and it has never sold a single share. That position is now worth a whopping $28 billion. Plus, Berkshire is on track to earn $776 million in dividend payments from the beverage giant this year alone.\n\nAlthough there was no way Buffett could have foreseen the AI revolution back then, his investment conglomerate will reap substantial rewards if this technology drives more revenue and earnings for Coca-Cola.\n\n3. Apple: 28.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion. The company is rolling out its Apple Intelligence software, which it developed in partnership with OpenAI to bring AI to the latest generation of iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.\n\nApple Intelligence can interpret messages and emails, and draft responses on command. It can also summarize content with a single tap, and prioritize notifications based on what is important to each individual user. Plus, Apple Intelligence will empower the Siri voice assistant with the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT application, which will make it more useful than ever.\n\nApple Intelligence will utilize Apple's latest chips, including the A18 Pro (for the iPhone), and the new M4 (for the iPad and Mac computers), which were specifically designed in-house for processing AI workloads. They allow AI features to function on-device, which creates a faster user experience because they don't have to send requests to external data centers for processing.\n\nBerkshire spent approximately $38 billion buying Apple stock between 2016 and 2023. Earlier this year, that position was worth over $170 billion, which accounted for almost half of the conglomerate's entire stock portfolio (by value). However, Berkshire sold 13% of its stake during the first quarter, which Buffett said was for tax reasons, and then it sold 49% of its remaining position in the second quarter.\n\nIt's possible the gigantic sales reflect Buffett's cautious view on the stock market overall, because the S&P 500 index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2, which is 55% more expensive than its long-term average of 18.1. Berkshire is now sitting on a record $277 billion in cash, so Buffett and his team might be waiting to pounce in the event of a market correction.\n\nNevertheless, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, so the conglomerate will still benefit nicely if Apple Intelligence pushes consumers to upgrade to the latest devices to access its features.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 9, 2024 – Zacks Value Investor is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\n\nThe Cheapest Mag 7 Stocks in 2024\n\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7? (6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "TSMC Sales Beat Estimates in Sign of Solid AI Chip Demand",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. posted a better-than-expected 39% rise in quarterly revenue, assuaging concerns that AI hardware spending is beginning to taper off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World’s Most Unequal Nation From Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums Singapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes Chicago’s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil Should Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\n\nThe main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported September-quarter sales of NT$759.7 billion ($23.6 billion), versus the average analyst projection for NT$748 billion. Taiwan’s largest company will disclose its full results next Thursday.\n\nHsinchu-based TSMC is one of the key companies at the heart of a global surge in spending on AI development, producing the cutting-edge chips needed to train artificial intelligence. Its sales have more than doubled since 2020, with the seminal launch of ChatGPT sparking a race to acquire Nvidia hardware for AI server farms.\n\nIn recent months, however, views have begun to diverge on whether the AI-driven growth momentum will last.\n\nSome investors have cautioned that the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google can’t sustain their current pace of infrastructure spending without a compelling and monetizable AI use case. That skepticism has led to a pullback in AI stocks, including flag bearer Nvidia, earlier this year.\n\nStill, TSMC shares have more than doubled since the launch of ChatGPT, with its market capitalization briefly crossing the $1 trillion mark in July. That month, Taiwan’s largest company also lifted its outlook for 2024 revenue growth after quarterly results beat estimates.\n\nThe revision underscored TSMC’s view that AI spending will remain elevated despite growing US-Chinese trade tensions. In both countries, startups and tech firms from Microsoft Corp. to Baidu Inc. are splurging on AI infrastructure in a race to develop applications.\n\nSome analysts worry that delays in the delivery of Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips might disrupt the industry, though most investors don’t view that as a long-term issue for TSMC. With Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. both struggling to get ahead in the business of bespoke chipmaking, TSMC’s market leadership is expected to help prop up margins.\n\nNvidia’s key server assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. earlier this week also reaffirmed demand for AI hardware remains solid. Hon Hai Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that his company plans to boost server production capacity to meet “crazy” demand for the next-generation Blackwell chips, echoing similar remarks from Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nWhile Apple’s A18 chip orders may decline due to soft demand for new iPhone 16s, robust orders from Nvidia and Intel are likely to offset any revenue shortfall for TSMC.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) closed the most recent trading day at $225.74, moving +1.83% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.97%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.3%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.45%.\n\nThe the stock of maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has risen by 0.35% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.21% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.41%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on October 31, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.60, up 9.59% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $94.53 billion, indicating a 5.62% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.17% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Apple is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 29.4. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 15.42.\n\nOne should further note that AAPL currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.32. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.71.\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 185, this industry ranks in the bottom 27% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But making decent money with dividends on a limited budget is not easy. Let's look at a success story where a young investor started with small investments and reached a reasonable income goal in just two years.\n\nAbout two years ago, an investor shared his story on r/Dividends, a discussion board on Reddit with more than 580,000 members interested in dividend investing. He started investing during the pandemic with just $100 deposits.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

In 2021 his dividend income stood at $305. This shows the power of compounding and letting money work for you.\n\nThe investor, who said he was 28 years old, was asked how much he invested to reach this income level. Here is what he said:\n\n\"50k invested, 2-3k per month in 2022, previous years less.\"\n\nWhile $1,000 a year is not much, it's a nice start for those looking to get into income investing with small contributions from their salary or savings.\n\nThe Redditor also shared his stock portfolio with fellow investors.

        "content": "Apple iPhone 16 Pro Boosts Sales, But Base Models Lag, Analyst Says\n\nKeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel said his September Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone carrier survey was slightly weaker, and Key First Look Data results were better.\n\nThe analyst’s carrier survey indicates that iPhone 16 sales in September were slightly below store expectations and normal seasonal trends.\n\nDemand for the iPhone 16 Pro and Max remained relatively healthy, owing to camera upgrades, but the base models were still weaker.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iPhone 16 Demand Gains Momentum As Delivery Times Steady: Analyst\n\nStore inventories are down to one day inventory outstanding (DOI), above prior year levels at launch. Apple AI was still a non-factor in driving near-term demand.\n\nKey First Look Data reflects an increase in iPhone demand, with Apple Store iPhone spending growth of 15% year-on-year during the first ten days of launch and 7% growth Y/Y during the launch weekend.\n\nNispel’s Key First Look Data shows indexed spending growth of 22% M/M in September, above the three-year average of 2%.\n\nThe Y/Y indexed spending accelerated to 7% from a 10% decline in August. In addition, when comparing the first ten days of new iPhone availability versus the comparable prior year, results were 12% Y/Y, though tailed off quickly.\n\nThe analyst noted that the results benefitted from an additional two days of iPhone availability compared to the prior year. In addition, he noted a benefit to iPhone 15 sales before the launch of iPhone 16 and initial demand that was modestly better Y/Y.\n\nNispel noted that his combined September carrier survey and Key First Look results were neutral for the Apple supply chain, which included Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Cirrus Logic, Inc (NASDAQ:CRUS), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), Qorvo, Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions, Inc (NASDAQ:SWKS).\n\nNispel maintained his Overweight rating and a price target of $210 on Broadcom based on 36 times his fiscal 2025 consolidated EPS of $5.90. Broadcom is trading at a forward consensus P/E of 29 times, compared to a three-year historical average of 18.\n\nThe analyst reiterated his Overweight rating on Cirrus Logic with a price target of $165, based on 19 times his fiscal 2026 EPS estimate of $8.65. Cirrus Logic is trading at a consensus P/E of 16 times compared to its three-year historical forward consensus P/E of 14.\n\nHe maintained his estimates and Sector Weight rating on Qualcomm, which has a fair value of $167, based on 15 times his fiscal 2025 EPS of $10.89. Qualcomm is trading at a forward consensus P/E of 15 times, compared to a three-year historical average of 13.\n\nStory continues\n\nNispel reiterated his Sector Weight rating on Qorvo, which has a fair value of $100, based on 14 times his fiscal 2026 EPS estimate of $6.95. Qorvo is trading at 13 times consensus forward P/E, compared to a three-year historical average of 13.\n\nThe analyst remained Sector Weight on Skyworks Solutions with a fair value of $95, based on 15 times his 2025 EPS estimate of $6.25. Skyworks Solutions is trading at a forward P/E of 15 times, compared to a three-year historical average of 11.\n\nNispel’s $216 fair value on Apple is based on 21.8 times his 2025 adjusted EBITDA versus big tech comps of ~18.5 times.

        "content": "Nvidia, AMD Lead The Pack, Broadcom Stable, Intel Falters: Analyst's Latest Take\n\nKeyBanc analyst John Vinh shared mixed quarterly supply chain findings for the semiconductor sector. The analyst revised several company estimates and price targets.\n\nThough most end markets were weak in analog, he noted indications of auto getting closer to a bottom. Traditional server and AI strength is sustained, with Blackwell on track to launch in the fourth quarter without further delays, as per Vinh.\n\nAlso Read: What’s Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Monday?\n\nThe analyst’s feedback on the iPhone 16 launch appears to be better than feared but could be better. Therefore, Vinh downgraded Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Synaptics Inc (NASDAQ:SYNA) to Sector Weight.\n\nGiven increased price competition, he expects Qualcomm to lose market share to Mediatek in the mid-to-low-end segment of the smartphone market. This headwind will compound the impacts of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ramping up its internal modem.\n\nThe Synaptics downgrade reflects its underperformance versus its IoT peers, given limited growth catalysts within its Enterprise & Automotive segment, representing almost 60% of overall revenues and the company’s highest margins. Vinh flagged increased competition in the Chinese market from local chipmaker HiSilicon as another headwind.\n\nAdditionally, the analyst’s findings were most favorable for Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), mixed for Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and negative for Monolithic Power Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:MPWR), Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU), Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC). He also fine-tuned his estimates on Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM).\n\nVinh noted that Nvidia’s Blackwell will likely ramp into mass production beginning in December, contributing over $7 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. He said Hopper demand remains strong, with fourth-quarter revenues increasing ~15% sequentially.\n\nAMD’s positive catalysts included traditional server demand, the inflection in Genoa instances in the cloud, demand for MI300X remains on track to ship 500K GPUs in 2024, and a possible update on its next-generation GPU and CPU at its AI event on Thursday.\n\nFor Broadcom, Vinh flagged sustained networking demand from improving traditional server demand, share gains from its 800Gb optical DSP launch, and higher revision of CoWoS demand. Broadcom’s upsides could be offset by Apple preparing its Wi-Fi 7 radio for the iPhone 17 in 2025.\n\nFor Micron, Vinh flagged oversupply as Micron prompts Samsung to convert its unused HBM capacity back to traditional DRAM to survive the competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonolithic Power Systems remains vulnerable, given RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorization) for Nvidia H100 AI servers related to field failures associated with Monolithic Power Systems’ power modules increasing again, affecting its market share on Blackwell.\n\nVinh highlighted his adverse findings from Asia for Marvell Technology. According to the analyst, Marvell is vulnerable to market share loss from the next-generation AWS Trainium 3 loss to Alchip, Google’s second-generation Axion ARM CPU, and Nvidia’s development of its 1.6T optical DSP.\n\nVinh mentioned his negative findings from Asia for Intel. The analyst highlighted Intel’s server market share loss to AMD and the ramp of Blackwell posing a headwind for Intel. He also flagged the lack of a cost-down AI CPU targeted at mass market AI PCs is likely to result in a share loss for Intel and disappointing feedback on Intel’s AI chip Gaudi 3.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNext-Gen Nvidia GPUs Could Be Revealed at CES 2025 – What You Need to Know\n\nLatest Ratings for QCOM\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight Feb 2022 JP Morgan Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for QCOM\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "title": "Why Apple (AAPL) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again",
        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Apple (AAPL). This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.90%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $1.40 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34 per share, representing a surprise of 4.48%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.53 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.32%.\n\nFor Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +1.94% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 31, 2024.\n\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7? (6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar? (28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nIt’s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\n\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\n\nWhat’s the Definition of a “Cheap” Stock?\n\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn’t mean that investor doesn’t want attractive valuations. A “cheap” stock, for value investors, doesn’t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company’s valuations are attractive.\n\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\n\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\n\nBut there’s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\n\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n\nAre There Any Deals in the Mag 7 Stocks?\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\n\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\n\nBut the sell-off doesn’t mean Tesla is cheap. It’s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That’s not cheap but at least it’s under 10.\n\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)\n\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\n\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it’s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it is Amazon’s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\n\nShould Amazon be on a value investor’s short list?\n\n3. NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA can’t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\n\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of “just” 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\n\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n\n4. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\n\nBut Apple isn’t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\n\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)\n\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\n\nIt’s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it’s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\n\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\n\nWhat Is the Cheapest of the Mag 7 stocks?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

She said that the \"changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices\".\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks decline across Europe as UK borrowing costs escalate\n\nSeparately, Google is also about to find out what the Department of Justice believes should be done to dismantle the tech giant’s dominance of the online search market.\n\nProsecutors are expected to submit a document as early as Tuesday in federal court outlining potential remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google acted as an illegal monopoly.\n\nShares in Alphabet were little changed in pre-market trading on Tuesday morning.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAnother US technology company in the red on Monday was Amazon, which closed the previous session 3% down.\n\nThis came after Wells Fargo downgraded the company's shares from an overweight to equal weight, lowering the price target to $183 from $225.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check, 8 October\n\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited challenges such as rising competition from Walmart (WMT), as well as moderating contribution from its ad business to operating income, and high costs linked to its satellite broadband project.\n\n\"Keeping these headwinds in context, Amazon remains a margin expansion story, just likely a more moderate margin expansion pace than the market expects,\" Gawrelski wrote.\n\nAmazon shares tumbled back in August after the retail and cloud giant offered a quarterly forecast that fell short of expectations.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe chipmaker was the only one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks to have closed Monday's session in the green, up 2.2%.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon, this group of tech stocks also includes Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThe rise in Nvidia shares on Monday lifted its market capitalisation to $3.13tn, seeing the chipmaker overtake Microsoft as the world's second most valuable company. Microsoft closed the previous session with a market valuation of $3.04tn.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nMeanwhile, senior executives at Taiwan's Foxconn (2354.TW), the world's largest contract electronic manufacturer, reportedly said on Tuesday that the company was building a production plant in Mexico for Nvidia's GB200 \"superchips\".\n\n\"We're building the largest GB200 production facility on the planet,\" said Benjamin Ting, Foxconn senior vice president for the cloud enterprise solutions business group, according to a Reuters report.\n\nShares jumped last week, after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC that demand for the company's next generation Blackwell chips has been \"insane\".\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nShares in Super Micro Computer surged nearly 16% on Monday, after the company said it's shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence per quarter.\n\nSuper Micro, which provides servers and data storage systems, also unveiled a suite of liquid cooling products in an announcement on Monday.\n\nThese liquid cooling products aim to keep GPUs and central processing units (CPUs) working at a certain temperature so they can operate efficiently, given the heat generated by the power used by servers.\n\nRead more: The best funds to invest in according to expert research teams\n\nCharles Liang, CEO and president of Super Micro, said the company's solutions were now \"cooling massive, state-of-the-art AI factories, reducing costs and improving performance\".\n\nShares in Super Micro underwent a 10-for-1 stock split last week, a trend which has been seen among a number of companies this year.\n\nThe company's shares have been under pressure recently following reports that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nVistry (VTY.L)\n\nIn the UK, housebuilder Vistry plunged nearly 29% on Tuesday morning, after the company issued a profit warning.\n\nVistry said in a trading update on Tuesday that it expected adjusted profit before tax for the 2024 fiscal year to be £80m ($104.7m) lower than previous anticipated, at around £350m. The housebuilder said it expected adjusted profit before tax to then be £30m lower in 2025 and £5m in 2026.\n\nThe fall in forecasted pre-tax profits was that the company had discovered that the cost projections for to complete some of the developments in its south division had been understated by around 10%.\n\nRead more: How to minimise a capital gains tax impact on your investments\n\nVistry said: \"We believe the issues are confined to the south division and changes to the management team in the division are underway.

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy If Kamala Harris Wins in November?",
        "content": "The stock market has performed pretty well as the Biden-Harris administration draws to a close. Despite the steep decline in 2022, the S&P 500 has soared nearly 50%. Much of this performance was driven by huge gains for the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nCould this momentum continue in a Kamala Harris administration? And, if so, what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins in November? Kamala Harris. Official White House photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nHarris' proposals that could affect the Magnificent Seven\n\nHarris has unveiled a wide range of economic proposals. Her campaign released an 82-page document outlining what she'd like to do to create what she calls \"an opportunity economy.\" Not all of the proposals in this document affect the Magnificent Seven, but several could.\n\nThe vice president's plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% has received significant media attention. Although this is a large increase, it's still lower than the maximum corporate tax rate of 39% that was in place before former President Donald Trump's tax cuts went into effect in 2018.\n\nAnother Harris proposal is to quadruple the tax rate on corporate stock buybacks. The rationale behind this plan is \"to encourage businesses to invest in growth and productivity.\"\n\nHarris also wants the federal government to invest in industries that are important to the country's economic and national security. Her plan specifically identifies the following types of businesses that would be eligible for tax credits:\n\nAerospace companies Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers Automobile manufacturers Biotechnology companies Clean energy manufacturers Semiconductor manufacturers Steel and iron producers\n\nEvaluating the impact of these proposals\n\nIn theory, the members of the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) -- would be affected equally by Harris' proposed corporate tax rate increase. However, in practice, this change could impact the big companies differently.\n\nThe following table shows the effective tax rates paid by the Magnificent Seven in their most recent fiscal years:\n\nCompany Effective Tax Rate Alphabet 13.9% Amazon 9.73% Apple 14.7% Meta Platforms 17.6% Microsoft 18% Nvidia 12% Tesla (50% Tax Benefit)\n\nData sources: Company 10-K filings. *Tesla received more tax benefits than it paid in taxes in 2023.\n\nAs you can see, none of the Magnificent Seven companies paid the full 21% corporate tax rate. Microsoft and Meta had the highest effective tax rates of the group. However, all of the companies have been adept at using the tax code to their advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about stock buybacks? Most of the Magnificent Seven members have repurchased shares in significant amounts. Apple has by far spent the most money on stock buybacks -- $70.6 billion in the nine months ended July 1, 2023. Increased taxes on stock buybacks could cause Apple and others to change their capital deployment strategies. However, I don't expect this would significantly impact their stock performance or underlying businesses.\n\nEach of these companies could benefit from the tax credits for AI data centers proposed by Harris. As the three largest cloud services providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet might be the biggest winners on this front. However, Nvidia could also be helped quite a bit because its GPUs are used heavily in AI data centers. In addition, Nvidia and Tesla could potentially receive tax credits offered to semiconductor makers and automakers, respectively.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins\n\nSo what's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy if Harris wins the presidential race? The honest answer is that there's insufficient information to know which stock might benefit the most from the aforementioned policies proposed by the vice president. Furthermore, it's uncertain if she would be able to implement all of her plans should she be elected. The U.S. Congress advances legislation; the president only signs the bills into law.\n\nThat said, many economists believe that Harris' economic policies would help control inflation, while Trump's plans (especially his proposed tariffs) could cause inflation to rise. If these economists are right, interest rates would more likely be lower during a Harris administration than they would otherwise be.\n\nWhile all the Magnificent Seven stocks should benefit from a lower-rate environment, I think the best pick of the group is Amazon. The company has a substantial debt load, which makes it a potentially bigger beneficiary of lower rates than the other Magnificent Seven members. Lower interest rates could also boost consumer and corporate spending, helping Amazon's e-commerce, advertising, and cloud services businesses.\n\nRegardless of which person occupies the White House over the next four years, Amazon should benefit from the shift of IT spending to the cloud from on-premises. This migration will likely be accelerated by AI advances.\n\nSurprisingly, Amazon stock has only climbed around 12% during Harris' time as VP. I suspect it could deliver much greater gains if she becomes president and interest rates decline further.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 of Wall Street's Most Influential Stocks Can Plunge if Kamala Harris Wins in November",
        "content": "Four weeks from today, on Nov. 5, voters will determine which direction our great country takes over the next four years.\n\nAlthough not every bill that comes out of Washington, D.C., has bearing on the stock market, the economic proposals that are, ultimately, put into place by the incoming president and Congress will help shape the landscape for corporate America in the coming years. Kamala Harris delivering remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Adam Schultz.\n\nCurrent vice president and Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris has proposed sweeping changes designed to lower food and drug costs, expand a variety of tax credits for middle-class families, and wants to reduce the federal deficit by raising the corporate tax rate by 33%.\n\nWhile some businesses would likely thrive with Harris in the White House, other high-flying companies may struggle.\n\nWhat follows are three of Wall Street's most-influential stocks that can plunge if Kamala Harris wins in November.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first highly influential business that could find the going tough if Harris proves victorious in November is social media colossusMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among other social sites.\n\nMeta sits atop the pedestal when it comes to social media websites. For the June-ended quarter, it attracted 3.27 billion daily active users across its family apps. No other social platform comes close to generating this level of daily visits, which is what provides Meta with exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nThe concern for Meta is the potential for Harris and her administration to go after monopoly like businesses. In an interview with CNN while running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, Harris suggested that she wanted to \"take a serious look\" at breaking up the company, and alluded that Meta (formerly known as Facebook) was \"essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\"\n\nAdmittedly, the political views of elected officials can and do change over time. It's not clear if Harris still believes that Mark Zuckerberg's company is in need of stronger regulations designed to protect consumer privacy interests. Nevertheless, her remarks from 2019 signal the very real possibility of pitting the Harris administration against some of Wall Street's most dominant companies.\n\nThe other reason Meta Platforms might struggle if Harris wins in November is her aforementioned plan to raise the corporate tax rate by a third -- from 21% to 28%. Even though Meta is quite profitable from its advertising operations, a higher tax rate would expose the widening losses it's contending with from its Reality Labs segment. This is the operating division focused on augmented/virtual reality devices and the company's metaverse ambitions, among other projects.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile a higher corporate tax rate has historically been positive for the benchmark S&P 500, this might not be the case for Meta Platforms. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNovo Nordisk\n\nA second market-leading company that could struggle mightily if Kamala Harris wins in four weeks is Danish-based pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO).\n\nNovo Nordisk found its way into the spotlight thanks to its blockbuster duo of injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. Ozempic is approved as a type 2 diabetes and long-term weight management treatment, while Wegovy is a weight management therapy for patients with at least one weight-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure. GLP-1 drugs are the first prescription weight-loss breakthrough from big pharma in quite some time.\n\nHowever, Harris has made bringing prescription drug costs down a key theme of her campaign. While the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration praised Eli Lilly for lowering the cost of GLP-1 drug Zepbound in August, it's called on other GLP-1 drugmakers to follow suit.\n\nNovo Nordisk doesn't seem eager to heed that call. The company's CEO, Lars Jorgensen, defended his company's stance in front of a U.S. Senate committee in September to charge $1,349 (retail) for a 28-day supply of Wegovy and $968 (retail) for a 28-day supply of Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is heavily reliant on Ozempic to propel future earnings growth. Not to mention, Wall Street is counting on Ozempic to buoy the company's outsized earnings multiple -- 27 times forward-year earnings.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding domestic drug pricing and what Harris would be able to accomplish in the Oval Office might be enough to halt what's been nothing short of a parabolic move higher for Novo Nordisk over the last three years.\n\nApple\n\nThe third highly influential stock that could plunge if Kamala Harris wins in November is none other than Wall Street's largest publicly traded company by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Interestingly enough, this is a company that may also struggle if Donald Trump wins.\n\nApple is best-known for being a dominant force in tech products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. But the lion's share of the company's growth at the moment traces back to its Services segment. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a multiyear transformation that's emphasizing the importance subscription services. A subscription-driven model should, ideally, improve the company's operating margin over time and smooth out the revenue valleys that often occur during iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nBut Apple could face something of a double whammy if Harris were to win and is able to implement the full scope of her economic proposals.\n\nTo begin with, raising the corporate tax rate by 33% would potentially leave Apple with less capital to funnel toward share buybacks. No public company has more directly benefited from share repurchases than Apple.\n\nSince the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased $700.6 billion worth of its common stock, which has helped to increase its earnings per share (EPS) from what would be less than $4 in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30, 2024) if it had never bought back its stock, to a consensus estimate of $6.68 per share in the current fiscal year. Without significant buybacks, Apple's stalled growth engine would be exposed.\n\nAdditionally, Kamala Harris has proposed taxing unrealized capital gains. Although this tax is strictly focused on individuals with net wealth above $100 million, a lot of the wealthiest tax payers are likely to have a stake, directly or via exchange-traded fund, in Wall Street's largest company by market cap.\n\nWhether it's Donald Trump's proposed 60% tariff on imports from China or Harris's plan to increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy and businesses, there's a real possibility Apple comes out a loser on Nov. 5.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Bank of America Stock and Buying This High-Yield Investment Instead",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the most widely respected investors in the world. And there's a good reason. With nearly 70 years investing in the public eye, he's produced incredible returns for anyone willing to invest alongside him. He recently saw the value of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) surpass $1 trillion. It's come a long way from the $22 million company Buffett took over in 1965, largely on the back of Buffett's investment prowess.\n\nToday Buffett and his fellow investment managers oversee about $600 billion in investable assets for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. And when Buffett makes a move in Berkshire's portfolio, the entire investing world pays attention.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's most recent move is to sell off a portion of Berkshire's investment in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). The bank stock was once Berkshire's second-largest position after Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), but Buffett is selling it and likely buying this high-yield investment instead. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's taking cash out of the bank\n\nInvestors typically have to wait until institutional investors like Berkshire Hathaway file form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see what changes they made in their portfolios during the previous quarter. But since Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 10% of Bank of America's outstanding shares, it's required to report any changes in its ownership within three business days. That's how we know Buffett sold over $9.6 billion worth of Bank of America stock during the third quarter and an additional $140 million in the first two days of October.\n\nBank of America is far from the only company Buffett's been cutting down on. He sold over half of Berkshire's position in Apple between Q4 of 2023 and Q2 of this year. While Apple remains Berkshire's largest position, the sales in Q2 represent the largest in Berkshire's history.\n\nIn fact, Buffett's been a net seller of stocks for seven consecutive quarters beginning with Q4 2022. Considering the size of his Bank of America stock sale, Berkshire will likely confirm an eighth-straight quarter when it reports its earnings next month.\n\nThere's a simple explanation for why Buffett has felt compelled to sell off significant portions of Berkshire's largest holdings: taxes and valuation.\n\nBuffett expects the current tax rate on corporate earnings to move higher after the current tax laws expire in 2025. They could revert to 35% from the current 21% rate if nothing happens. Kamala Harris has proposed a 28% corporate tax rate. Donald Trump would likely push for a continuation of the 21% rate instituted under his previous administration. But given the current government deficit, Buffett sees the current rate as unsustainable.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Buffett hasn't said explicitly, though, is that selling now to save on taxes later only makes sense if he also feels the stocks he's selling are trading near or above their intrinsic value. Buffett wouldn't sell a stock trading well below its real value just to save on taxes. And given his lack of investments in other companies, it's clear Buffett doesn't see a lot of opportunities to invest Berkshire Hathaway's funds in right now.\n\nBut Buffett has consistently taken the opportunity to buy one high-yield investment, and that's likely where most of Berkshire's cash from stock sales is headed.\n\nThe ultrasafe, high-yield investment on Berkshire's balance sheet\n\nOver the last two years, Buffett has been piling money into U.S. Treasury bills. As of the end of Q2, Berkshire Hathaway held $238.7 billion worth of U.S. Treasury bills. It also had about $38.2 billion in cash. That total of $276.9 billion is up from $109 billion as of the end of Q3 2022.\n\nThese short-term Treasury bonds mature within 12 months. Buffett prefers short-term government bonds as they provide the highest level of safety. They're more insulated from interest-rate risk, which could cause the value of the bonds to decline, resulting in a loss in value if Buffett needed liquidity.\n\nOver the last two years Buffett's gotten the dual benefits of safety and yield, as short-term bonds paid more in interest than long-term bonds. That's because many expect interest rates to move lower over the long run as the Fed cuts rates and aims to keep them stable. But Buffett has said he'd be happy to keep much of Berkshire's assets in Treasury bonds even if they didn't pay nearly as much.\n\nThe reason Buffett's flocked to the safe investment isn't the high yield he can get in today's market. The reason is simple: He doesn't think there's a more effective use for the money.\n\nWhile that may sound like a stark warning for most investors, the truth is it only applies to the portion of the market Berkshire can operate in. The universe of stocks Buffett could possibly buy is limited to the biggest companies in the world. That makes it harder to earn market-beating returns. \"I would not like to be running $10 billion now,\" Buffett said at the Berkshire shareholder meeting in May. \"$10 million I think Charlie or I could earn high returns on,\" he noted.\n\nThat suggests that he doesn't recommend the average investor pile their money into Treasury bills. There are plenty of opportunities out there for small investors with \"just\" $10 million or less. But if you need a place to park your cash while you look for them, short-term Treasuries still offer an attractive yield for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Jobs did this for many years before switching over to the Mercedes-Benz SL55.\n\nAccording to the report, Jobs did this because he hated license plates.\n\nAt one point, the state of California did not require new vehicles to have a license plate for up to six months. Therefore, Jobs would lease a new vehicle every six months and then switch to a new model—a move that wouldn’t require him to ever need a license plate.\n\nDid You Know?\n\n‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\n\nThe Loophole Ended Years Later: What would become known as the “Steve Jobs Loophole,” was eventually ended in January 2019.\n\nThe state of California made the switch to temporary license plates required at the time of a new vehicle sale. Under the new rule, the temporary license plates had to be replaced with real license plates for the front and back of the vehicles in the state.\n\nBefore 2019, the period was also cut down to three months without license plates required, which came after Jobs’ death. So, we will never know if Jobs had made the move to have a new vehicle every three months before the loophole’s full end.\n\nJobs served as the CEO of Apple from 1997 until 2011, when he stepped down in August and chose Tim Cook to replace him.

It’s a vital role at a company known for driving a hard bargain with vendors — an approach that bolsters the profit margins of iPhones, iPads and other products.\n\nFor years, Rosckes ran Apple’s procurement group alongside former executive Tony Blevins, who left in 2022. With that departure, Rosckes took sole charge of the organization, reporting to operations chief Sabih Khan. Tom, meanwhile, led procurement of silicon, wireless components and batteries. He joined Apple in 2003 to work on its legal team.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the moves.\n\nAs a vice president, Rosckes is one of about 100 executives helping Apple’s senior management team run the company on a daily basis. While not a household name, he has been a key player at Apple for two decades, helping ensure that products come out on time each year. The company purchases components in massive quantities, and its sourcing decisions can reshape the tech industry.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, several Apple vice presidents left the company, but the rate of departures has slowed so far in 2024. Still, bigger changes are likely coming in the next few years, with many top executives nearing retirement age. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, for instance, turns 64 in November and has been with Apple for more than 25 years.\n\nIn August, Apple announced that Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri is stepping down from his role at the end of this year. The company said he will remain at Apple in a more limited position, overseeing information systems, corporate digital security and real estate efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updated with details about Apple CEO Tim Cook in penultimate paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

        "title": "Federal judge orders Google to open its Android app store to competition",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire.\n\nThe injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\n\nThe judge’s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\n\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\n\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\n\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court’s decision.\n\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper.\n\nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store — a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\n\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google.\n\nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\n\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store.\n\n“Provided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,” said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. “No doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store’s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.”\n\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, “some consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.” And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads.\n\n“So Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,” Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nAlphabet's shares fell $4.08, or 2.4%, to close Monday at $162.98.\n\nView comments",

For a Master of Brutalist Provocations, a Modest Museum Appraisal\n\n“The high expectations for iPhone 16/17 are premature,” as “a lack of material new features and limited AI coverage mean high market expectations (5%-10% unit growth) are unlikely to be met,” wrote Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who assumed coverage of the stock with a hold rating. The firm previously had a buy rating.\n\nShares of Apple have rallied around 34% from their April low, with much of the gain reflecting optimism that the AI features will drive consumers to upgrade their phones, re-accelerating revenue growth. But the early signs indicate demand have been mixed.\n\nLee said he recognizes the long-term potential in AI, seeing Apple as “the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.” However, he said the current valuation is “rich” and that AI won’t be a driver in the near-term.\n\n“Smartphone hardware needs rework before being capable of serious AI,” and that has a “likely timeline of 2026/27.”\n\nWall Street is more cautious on Apple than some other big tech companies.

        "content": "October 7, 2024 (Maple Hill Syndicate) - I can only buy on train wrecks, famed money manager John Neffonce said.\n\nNeff's lament was that his fund (the Windsor Fund) had grown so large that he normally couldn't buy a stockwithout pushing the price up. Accordingly, he felt that he could only buy on bad news.\n\nMost of us don't have the problem that afflicted Neff. But buying good stocks on bad news is a wise investmenttechnique for almost anyone.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with OXY.\n\nThat's the goal of my quarterly Casualty List. It comprises stocks that have been roughed up in the latestquarterly, and that I think can bounce back strongly.\n\nIn the third quarter, the stock market was up but many stocks still took it on the chin. Here are four that Ifeel have excellent recovery potential.\n\nOccidental\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY), based in Houston, Texas, is on investors' radar because Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), owns about 28% of its stock. Betting with Buffett, oftenconsidered the premiere investor in the U.S., is often a good idea.\n\nBut investors went the other way in the third quarter, knocking down a slew of oil stocks as the price of oil fellfrom $83 a barrel to $69. OXY fell 18% in the quarter.\n\nI believe that oil and gas will be energy mainstays for the U.S. well into the 2030s. In addition, the war betweenIsrael and its neighbors poses a risk to world oil supplies a risk that I don't believe is fully reflected in the price of oil as of early October.\n\nHumana\n\nHumana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), with headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the country's largest healthinsurers. Its strength and its weakness, too is that it specializes in insurance for people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the U.S. military program called Tricare.\n\nReliant on the government, Humana was grievously hurt when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave many of its health plans low grades in a review in early October. This could cripple future enrollment in Humana's plans. The shares dropped 12% on October 1 after falling 15% in the third quarter.\n\nThis is terrible news, but Humana has been profitable for 24 years in a row. Over the past decade, it has grownits revenue by close to 12% per year. I think that management, led by new CEO Jim Rechtin, can probably right the ship.\n\nAmkor\n\nAmkor Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) does semiconductor testing and packaging. Its largest customers are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). Apple alone is nearly 28% of sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe word Amkor stems from America and Korea. The company was founded in Korea in 1968 and now has itsheadquarters in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nIn the past year Amkor's sales fell about 8%, and profits (always more volatile than sales) dropped about 34%.\n\nAs a result, Amkor shares fell 23% in the third quarter. Of the 10 analysts who cover it, six rate it a buy.\n\nVisteon\n\nVisteon Corp. (NASDAQ:VC), out of Buren Township, Michigan, is an auto-parts maker that Ford Motor Co. spun off in2000. Today Visteon sells parts to Ford, BMW, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Renault, and Ford's longtime arch rival General Motors. Instrument clusters and electronics are its specialties.\n\nThe stock fell 11% in the third quarter after sales dipped slightly. More than 80% of new cars are financed,and interest rates in the past year have fairly high. Now the Federal Reserve is moving to reduce rates, which I figure will help car sales.\n\nThe Record\n\nThis column is the 86thone in my quarterly Casualty List series. One-year returns can be calculated for 82 columns. The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 14.9%, compared to 11.3% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index.\n\nThat's good news.

        "title": "Google is about to learn how DOJ wants to remake its empire",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is about to find out what the Justice Department believes should be done to dismantle the tech giant’s dominance of the online search market.\n\nProsecutors are expected to submit a document as early as Tuesday in federal court outlining potential remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google acted as an illegal monopoly.\n\nIt will be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen now in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025.\n\nPotential remedies range from an outright breakup of Google, to making its search engine data available to competitors, to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. Judge Amit Mehta, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, will decide what remedies Google should face. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) (Mark Wilson via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it's going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability,\" antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly, a breakup of Google’s empire — the most rare of antitrust remedies — has the most potential to reorder the tech universe.\n\nThat could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multibillion-dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nA divestment of Android away from Google could have consequences for devices aside from those installed on devices used for internet search. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court last October after testifying to defend his company in the largest antitrust case since the 1990s. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nPeloton, for example, uses the open sourced system to power its exercise equipment. Airplane manufacturers use it to power video screens, and supermarkets use it to run their consumer kiosks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDevelopers also rely on Google to maintain Android’s ability to work across platforms.\n\nHittinger expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office copier market.\n\nThe company was no longer allowed to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third-party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nExclusive contracts\n\nOne likely scenario, antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on internet browsers and internet-connected devices that use Google’s Android operating system.\n\nGoogle pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones.\n\nProskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass said he suspects Judge Mehta to be particularly receptive to remedies that undo those contracts because their anti-competitive effects were at the heart of the ruling.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint and an even narrower ruling,\" Kass said.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple and other companies that benefit from the contracts testified that they chose Google for the quality of its search engine. Competing evidence from the DOJ showed Microsoft's Bing search engine attracted more users on its Edge browser when Google was not the default option.\n\nAn end to these revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Google and Apple.\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 plus billion for Apple each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google. CEO of Apple Tim Cook. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, said device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search but under new non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nIf Google can't get default placement any longer, it could also be required to give consumers a choice of search provider.\n\nMcGinn predicted the DOJ would ask that mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers give consumers a choice between search providers.\n\n\"It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers pre-programmed to use another search engine,\" McGinn said.\n\nLast year, the European Union’s antitrust regulator, the European Commission, required Google to give a choice screen based on its determination that the lack of choice violated its antitrust law.\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe DOJ could also ask the judge to force Google to share with rival browsers and search providers its “click and query” data that it uses to refine its search algorithms.\n\nSpecifically, the data includes Google’s intellectual property that tracks and learns from information that its search engine users type into its search field and links they choose by clicking on query results.\n\nRival US search providers include Microsoft (MSFT) Bing, Yahoo Search, and DuckDuckGo. International search providers include Russia’s Yandex and China’s Bidau.\n\nA spokesman for DuckDuckGo told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped the case would result in Google having to share its click and query data.\n\nThe data could help more privacy oriented browsers like DuckDuckGo and search engines compete against Google.\n\nThe spokesman said it can be more difficult for DuckDuckGo to attract advertisers because, unlike Google, it does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nAnother remedy that some legal experts expect to be on the DOJ’s list is for Google to temporarily open up its internet index data to rival browser providers, such as Microsoft’s Edge, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, Brave, and Opera.\n\nAI\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nJudge Mehta, however, may have to consider how remedies to restore competition in the traditional search engine market may impact competition in the emerging market for AI-assisted search.\n\nOne concern, legal experts said, is that Google's search dominance could unfairly entrench its position in the market for next generation search.\n\nAt the same time, these fresh threats may work to Google’s advantage in the remedies trial, allowing it to argue that its overall search dominance is already under threat.\n\n\"If a violation is found, Google will say the market is already solving itself,\" said former US Federal Trade Commission Chairman and George Washington University antitrust law professor William Kovacic.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple stock downgraded by Jefferies, which says 'serious AI' smartphones are 2 years away",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) was snubbed by investment firm Jefferies (JEF) late Sunday. Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple stock from Buy to Hold, citing concerns over inflated expectations for its new AI-enabled iPhones.\n\nLee said smartphone hardware is not yet advanced enough to accommodate the kind of high-tech artificial intelligence analysts and iPhone consumers are hoping for.\n\n“Near-term expectations for iPhone 16 and even 17 are too high,\" Lee wrote in a note to investors Sunday night.\n\nBig Tech companies have raced to innovate generative artificial intelligence technologies and secure their footing in an AI-dominated market. Up until this summer, Wall Street worried if Apple could catch up to rivals such as Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), which rushed to release new AI chatbots and chips, while Apple CEO Tim Cook remained elusive about the iPhone maker's AI plans. Now that Apple set into motion its AI vision with the upcoming release of Apple Intelligence, its next hurdle — like its competitors — is proving that it can monetize those artificial intelligence plans.\n\nApple stock ticked down 0.8% Monday morning on the news.\n\n“Unlike AI servers, smartphones lack high-speed memory and advanced packaging tech that allow fast data transfer between AP and memory, thus limiting their AI capabilities,” Lee said, adding, “To expect an accelerated smartphone replacement cycle now due to AI is premature, in our view.”\n\nLee said that it will take two to three more years for manufacturers like Apple to create smartphone hardware that's capable of running artificial intelligence software as smoothly as consumers expect.\n\nApple unveiled its suite of artificial intelligence tools, called Apple Intelligence, at its Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Apple’s long-awaited AI debut, in addition to its reveal of a partnership with OpenAI, boosted the stock to record highs. It more than alleviated investor concerns over Apple’s barrage of bad news earlier in the year — from struggling iPhone sales and layoffs to clashes with antitrust regulators at home and abroad. Bank of America (BAC) analyst Wamsi Mohan predicted a future in which Apple’s AI-enabled “intelliphones” dominate the market. The Apple iPhone 16 is on display at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York. (AP Photo/Pamela Smith) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut Apple’s initial launch of its iPhone 16, equipped with hardware to run its Apple Intelligence features that begin rolling out this month, has so far disappointed Wall Street. Analysts say demand for Apple’s latest smartphone is weaker than it was after past iPhone launches, citing shipping times as a metric. While both new and existing Apple customers are looking to buy the iPhone 16 for its faster connectivity, fewer cited Apple’s upcoming AI features as a motivating factor, according to JPMorgan's (JPM) most recent consumer survey.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, Lee said Apple is well positioned to lead the AI smartphone market in the future. Lee said Apple “is the only hardware-software integrated player that can leverage proprietary data to offer low-cost, personalized AI services.”\n\n“We believe AAPL is the leader in mobile AI tech, and its chip-OS-AI integrated ecosystem puts it far ahead of the fragmented Android competition.”\n\nSome 65% of Wall Street analysts covering Apple recommend buying the stock and see shares rising around 9% to nearly $245 over the next 12 months. Lee expects the stock to drop about 6% to $213.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Sold Half of Apple (AAPL) Shares in Q3",
        "content": "Vltava Fund, an investment management company, recently released its third-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The portfolio had a surprisingly favorable July and a negative September. The last quarter saw significant movements in stocks overall. The first part of August saw the most market volatility. The major stock markets are currently experiencing an environment of interest rate reduction for the first time in a long time. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nVltava Fund highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter 2024 investor letter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 2.04%, and its shares gained 25.93% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On October 4, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $226.80 per share with a market capitalization of $3.422 trillion.\n\nVltava Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"You probably have not missed the news that Warren Buffett has already sold half the stock from his largest public markets investment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). It was a phenomenal investment for Berkshire. Over the course of seven years or so, it brought a profit of well over USD 100 billion. Apple comprised a very large position within Berkshire’s public portfolio, and this was the reason we avoided Apple stock outright during that time. We considered our exposure to Apple through our holdings of Berkshire stock to be sufficient, and we ended up making a lot of money on it. There has been a great deal of speculation in the market about what Buffett’s sale of Apple signals regarding his view of the stock market. I think the reason for the sale is much simpler. Buffett probably considers Apple stock so expensive that he prefers to cash in at 20% less (after all, Berkshire must pay tax on its profits). He started selling in the first quarter of the year. When I was in Omaha for the general meeting in May, Buffett said he was still selling, and I expect he continued to do so in the third quarter. I have to say that, as a Berkshire shareholder, I am happy about the Apple sale. I think Berkshire’s management will find a better use for this money, as they always have in the past. It is quite likely that they already have a very specific idea about this. If that takes two or three years, it does not matter at all. This is not a race and, in the meantime, the risk of holding Berkshire Hathaway stock itself has been greatly reduced.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 9th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 184 hedge fund portfolios held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the second quarter which was 150 in the previous quarter. In the June quarter Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered $85.8 billion in revenues, up 5% from a year ago. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVIDIA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nIn another article, we discussed Apple Inc.

        "content": "Cramer Says 'Hot Money' Flowing From Nvidia, Apple Into China, Focus On Alibaba 'If You Must'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nJim Cramer is sounding the alarm, but not in the way you might expect. For those bullish on Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cramer's latest take might be hard to swallow.\n\nHot Money Streaming Out Of Nvidia, Apple\n\nIn a tweet, Cramer said, “The hot money is streaming out of Nvidia and Apple and into China. Let it stream. Do not defend these now. Let this money leave. On China only BABA has actual fundamentals if you must... But let it rain here. Get all of these short Nvidia options and ETFs to play out.”\n\nDon’t Miss Out:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nThe reasoning? Cramer hints that Nvidia's sky-high valuations and Apple's post-iPhone slump might leave them vulnerable to short-term pain. If you’re holding Nvidia options or ETFs, Cramer believes you might want to ride the short wave.\n\nCramer’s suggestion is a subtle signal that a pullback could be looming, especially as investor sentiment shifts and valuations begin to look more stretched than a Friday-night binge-watch.\n\nThe GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVD) and the Direxion Daily NVDA Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:NVDD) are inverse ETFs positioned to gain on Nvidia stock’s underperformance. Investors in the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares (NASDAQ:AAPD) gain when Apple shares underperform.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

According to Cramer, only one Chinese juggernaut is worth considering amid the capital outflows into China: Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) (NYSE:BABAF).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce giant, despite facing regulatory hurdles, is backed by solid fundamentals.

        "title": "Apple shares tick lower as Jefferies cuts rating on rich valuation",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Monday after Jefferies analysts cut their rating on the stock from Buy to Hold. The investment bank set a price target of $212.92 on Apple, suggesting a potential downside of around 6% from the last closing price.\n\nThe downgrade comes as Jefferies analysts raise concerns about the overestimated market expectations for the upcoming iPhone 16 and 17 models. More concretely, the tech giant’s heavy reliance on iPhone sales, which accounted for 52% of the company's revenue in fiscal year 2023, was highlighted as a key factor for the revision.\n\nThe analysts believe that the market's anticipation of 5%-10% unit growth for the new iPhone models is unrealistic due to a lack of significant new features and limited AI capabilities. Initial demand for the iPhone 16 is projected to be weaker than expected, with forecasts indicating flat volume growth for the second half of calendar year 2024 compared to the iPhone 15, and only a 2.5% growth in lifecycle volume for the iPhone 16.\n\nThe report also casts doubt on the near-term impact of AI technology in smartphones, suggesting that AI-capable smartphone technology is “likely 2-3 years away.” The current limitations in high-speed memory and advanced packaging technology in smartphones restrict their AI capabilities.\n\n“To expect an accelerated smartphone replacement cycle now due to AI is premature, in our view,” Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, Apple is expected to introduce a new, thinner iPhone model, dubbed the \"17 Air,\" in 2025, which could stimulate upgrade demand.\n\nJefferies remains bullish about Apple's long-term AI capabilities, acknowledging the company as “the only hardware-software integrated smartphone player.”\n\nBy the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026, Apple is estimated to have 490 million AI-capable iPhones in use, with the number potentially rising to 845 million by fiscal year 2027. Apple's OpenELM model and another language learning model, Ferret-UI, are expected to reinforce its leadership in mobile AI technology.\n\n“We believe AAPL is the leader in mobile AI tech, and its chip-OS-AI integrated ecosystem puts it far ahead of the fragmented Android competition,” analysts noted.\n\nThe investment firm also highlights Apple's strategic partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which gives Apple a long-term technological and cost advantage. This collaboration is anticipated to help Apple expedite the commercialization of AI-enabling technologies and secure lower costs for advanced nodes in comparison to its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn valuation, Jefferies notes that while Apple's stock appears elevated in the near term, especially with fiscal year 2024 earnings projections falling below consensus, there is potential for long-term upside driven by AI-related fee income.\n\nApple's fiscal year 2026 earnings are expected to surpass consensus, and the firm's upside valuation is based on the possibility of Apple charging a monthly fee for AI services, with a target of $306.99.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares tick lower as Jefferies cuts rating on rich valuation\n\nUS stock futures turn lower; Fed speakers, inflation and earnings in focus\n\n10-year Treasury yield hits 4%, keeping equity bulls in check\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Huawei Technologies is set to debut its highly anticipated home-grown mobile operating system HarmonyOS Next on Tuesday, touting it as an alternative to Apple's iOS and Google's Android, as the telecommunications equipment giant rallies domestic tech firms to build a Chinese mobile ecosystem amid US sanctions.\n\nFrom Tuesday, HarmonyOS Next will be publicly available on Huawei's Mate 60 series, the Mate X5 foldable smartphone and its 13.2 inch tablet MatePad Pro.\n\nHarmonyOS Next, which Huawei touts as being entirely independently developed, no longer supports Android-based applications and has been dubbed \"pure blood\" HarmonyOS in China.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe new mobile platform, which was made available for developers in China in January this year, is \"a new life striving to grow\", said Richard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei's consumer business group, at a company event in Shanghai last month.\n\n\"We covered the path of over a decade of foreign operating system ecosystem development in just one year,\" Yu added.\n\nRichard Yu Chengdong, chairman of Huawei's Consumer Business Group, displays the world's first commercial tri-fold smartphone, the Mate XT, in Shenzhen, Sept. 10, 2024.

Photo: Xinhua>\n\nAhead of the launch, Huawei mobilised China's app developers to support the operating system in what it called an \"oath-taking ceremony\" last month, according to a September 26 blog post on Huawei's website.\n\nProminent Chinese Big Tech firms, including Baidu, JD.com, Meituan and Tencent Holdings, all attended the meeting, Huawei said. More than 10,000 applications and native services have been developed for HarmonyOS Next, according to the company.\n\n\"Only with our own ecosystem can HarmonyOS truly be a mobile operating system,\" deputy chairman Eric Xu Zhijun said at the meeting, according to Huawei.\n\n\"We hope that all application owners, including governments, enterprises, institutions, can develop native HarmonyOS versions,\" Xu said.\n\nHuawei first launched HarmonyOS as an Android alternative for the Chinese market in August 2019, just months after the US government added the Shenzhen-based company to a trade blacklist that blocked it from buying US-originated technologies without Washington's approval.\n\nStory continues\n\nA pedestrian is reflected in a window at one of Huawei's stores in Beijing, China, Sept. 11, 2020.

Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nDomestic adoption of the mobile platform jumped last year on the back of Huawei's return to the 5G handset segment last year with its Mate 60 series smartphones.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone market in the first three months of this year, doubling its presence from the same period last year and overtaking Apple's iOS to become the second-biggest mobile operating system in mainland China, according to a Counterpoint report in June.\n\nWhile Android continued to dominate China's mobile market with a 68 per cent share in the same period, iOS fell slightly behind with a 16 per cent share, the research firm said.\n\nHarmonyOS Next's planned release comes days after Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, daughter of company founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei, retook the helm of the firm under its rotating chair system.\n\nThe 52-year-old Meng will also oversee the launch of Huawei's next flagship 5G handset series, the Mate 70, this fourth quarter.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Best Morgan Stanley Overweight &amp; Quality Stock?",
        "content": "We recently made a list of Morgan Stanley’s Best Overweight & Quality Stocks: Top 25 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks on the list of the top overweight and quality stocks.\n\nThe close of September has cemented the paradigm shift on Wall Street. With the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate cut being all that investors could hope for as it reduced rates by 50 basis points, since the cut, the flagship S&P stock index and the broader NASDAQ stock index are up by 2% and 3%, respectively. The rate cut has also now moved Wall Street’s focus to the next big catalyst for the stock market, i.e, the third quarter earnings season.\n\nFor a market that has touched new highs this year due to artificial intelligence, the second quarter earnings season was nothing short of fireworks. It saw the AI narrative wobble temporarily after mixed results from the world’s leading AI GPU designer and the semiconductor industry reckoned with the fate of the semiconductor manufacturing stock that ranked 5th on the list of Jim Cramer’s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.\n\nStarting with the chip maker, its second quarter earnings were nothing short of a bloodbath. They saw the firm’s non GAAP net income drop by a whopping 85% annually and turn a year ago GAAP net income into a non GAAP loss of $1.6 billion. At the same time, its gross margins dropped by 0.4 percentage points, and in the worst example of the cherry on top, the firm also announced that it will be suspending dividends starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, its shares tanked by 30% after the earnings, and since then, we’ve seen multiple reports claim that other companies are interested in acquiring it.\n\nAs for the GPU designer, its second quarter revenue jumped by 122% – a no small feat considering that the year ago quarter’s revenue was $13.5 billion. However, even as the Q2 revenue of $30 billion beat analyst estimates of $28.7 billion which was fueled by its AI data center division’s revenue jumping by 154% annually, the shares fell by 6% in extended trading. At the heart of the fall was a tepid third quarter guidance of $32.5 billion (analyst estimates were $31.77 billion), a gross margin miss by 0.1 percentage point, a Q3 margin guidance miss by 0.5 percentage points, and the delay of its Blackwell GPU to the fourth quarter. For investors already worried about the ability of AI to generate a profit, the margin miss in particular wasn’t comforting. Consequently, since the earnings report, the firm’s shares are down by 1%.\n\nHowever, investment bank Morgan Stanley sent the GPU designer’s shares soaring by 6.8% in September in a bullish note that shared that the firm could earn $10 billion in its fourth quarter alone from the latest Blackwell chips. This upgrade came on the back of MS remaining consistent in its analysis of the stock market this year. The key themes that it has identified are the labor market, commercial real estate, and the split in the stock market between large and small cap stocks.\n\nIn July, the bank shared that there was “ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.” In simpler terms, it means that MS believed that for small cap equities to catch up to large caps in performance, the economy has to perform well. If you’re wondering how wide this gap is, data shows that for small and medium cap and large cap stocks which are in the top 20% in terms of free cash flow margins, the small and mid caps have a forward price to earnings ratio of 0.74x relative to large caps as of April 2024, which is quite low when compared to the April 2009 peak of 1.62x. MS reiterated this belief in its August report, which shared that small cap outperformance “requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates. While recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.”\n\nHowever, MS’ September report took somewhat of a different tune. It focused on the clean energy and infrastructure investments in the US to share that these could help some segments of the American stock market that are typically dependent on growth in economic activity. Government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS and Science Act have led to roughly $500 billion in commitments by the private sector to invest in a diverse set of areas ranging from roads, to clean energy manufacturing and heavy industry.\n\nAs per the bank, “Government policies such as the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Act are sponsoring growth in many areas of U.S. manufacturing. These trends could offer through-the-cycle structural support to areas of the economy that are traditionally very cyclical.” On the data front, MS reveals that while in 2022, US manufacturing capacity as a percentage of 2017 output sat at ~126%, this has jumped to nearly 129% as of 2024.\n\nShifting gears, the third quarter earnings season will soon start to shape how investors view the market. Data from LSEG shows that the flagship S&P index is expected to deliver 5.4% annual earnings growth during Q3. FactSet is more cautious, as it shares that the index should grow earnings by 4.6% annually to mark its sixth straight quarter of growth. MS is of the view that the economy has to continue to deliver on the data front if the stock market is to perform well.\n\nIn a recent podcast, the bank’s chief investment officer and chief strategist, Mike Wilson, shared that “the unemployment rate will need to decline and the payrolls above 140,000 with no negative revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, I am also watching several other variables closely to determine the trajectory of growth. Earnings revision breadth, the best proxy for company guidance, continues to trend sideways for the overall S&P 500 and negatively for the Russell 2000 small cap index. Due to seasonal patterns, this variable is likely to face negative headwinds over the next month.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Morgan Stanley’s best Overweight and quality stocks, we ranked the bank’s recent list of 66 stocks with Overweight ratings, a higher than median quality score, and one month upward EPS revisions by their percentage one month average analyst revisions. The average EPS data was sourced from Yahoo Finance as of September 26th 2024, and the top 25 stocks with non zero percent revisions were selected.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 184\n\nAverage Analyst EPS % Revision: 0.6%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a dominating player in the global consumer electronics industry. The firm derives 52% of its revenue from the iPhone lineup, which makes smartphones a key part of its hypothesis. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s market value of $3.46 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, is built on the iPhone’s brand loyalty and based on belief surrounding the firm’s superior product design, manufacturing, and marketing practices. Consequently, any weakness in iPhone sales also tends to impact the share price. As an example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s shares slid by nearly 3% in mid September after TF Securities’ well known iPhone analyst Ming-Chi Kuo noted that the first weekend sales of the latest iPhone 16 lineup were 12% lower than the year ago comparable figures for the iPhone 15. However, he added that the iPhone 16’s key differentiating factor, Apple Intelligence, was not available at launch. This suggests that if the analyst is correct, then the feature’s introduction could prove to be a catalyst to the sales and consequently, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n“Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th when we look at Morgan Stanley's top overweight stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\n\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\n\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Citi analyst Atif Malik recently released a research note on the firm, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $265. Malik cut the iPhone unit forecasts in the September and December quarters by 2 million each and now expects iPhone 16 units to be 83 million this year. He also increased the March and June 2025 quarter iPhone unit estimates up by 4 million and 7 million, respectively. Citi now expects 2024 and 2025 iPhone units to be 224 million and 246 million, respectively, or down 3% and 9% on a year-over-year basis. With Apple Intelligence to be released in the US later in October and a major Siri update likely next year, the iPhone refresh will happen in 2025 with the iPhone 17 launch, the analyst told investors in the research note.\n\nLatest reports indicate that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has successfully defended itself against patent infringement claims concerning user verification and data security technology placed into iPhones. According to a report by news publication Bloomberg, the Austin federal jury for the US District Court of the Western District of Texas determined that the US tech giant did not infringe four asserted patents by placing tech for Face ID, Touch ID, and passcode security features into iPhone smartphones.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What Does Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Share Price Indicate?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$235 and falling to the lows of US$207. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Apple's current trading price of US$227 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple Worth?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 2.9% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $233.62, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Apple’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Apple generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Apple's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 36%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AAPL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Apple and you'll want to know about them.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Apple, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Join Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft in the Trillion-Dollar Club by 2030",
        "content": "Getting to a $1 trillion market cap is such a challenging milestone that only a handful of corporations have done it. The list includes several tech giants, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Though this elite club is highly exclusive, more companies will eventually join it. Stocks that are headed that way might be worth serious consideration. Let's look at two: Visa(NYSE: V) and Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO). These companies could be trillion-dollar stocks by 2030.\n\n1. Visa\n\nVisa runs one of the largest payment networks in the world, helping facilitate millions of daily credit card transactions. The company has delivered excellent returns during the past decade as cash transactions continue to be replaced by other payment forms. Visa's market cap is just under $550 billion as of this writing -- so it needs a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 10.5% to become a trillion-dollar company by the end of 2030. That's well within the company's powers. For one, Visa has performed much better than that during the past decade. V Total Return Level Chart\n\nOf course, that doesn't guarantee the company will deliver the same returns in the future, but some of the underlying factors that led to such solid performances in the past for the business are still in place. Visa remains a leader in its industry, with its only true noteworthy competitor being Mastercard(NYSE: MA). Visa still benefits from network effects: The more people carry credit cards that bear its logo, the more attractive its ecosystem becomes to merchants, and vice versa. That helps ensure that it will remain a major player in this industry for a while.\n\nVisa also still has plenty of room to grow. Credit card penetration is relatively high in many developed countries, but not so in others. In developing countries, there is even more potential. Visa sees a $20 trillion opportunity across a range of payments it can capture. The company's revenue of about $35 billion in the trailing 12-month period is a tiny percentage of that total. If Visa can make headway in its addressable market, the company's revenue, earnings, and stock price should move in the same direction they have during the past 10 years.\n\nThe company is well-equipped to deliver a CAGR of more than 10.5% through 2030.\n\n2. Novo Nordisk\n\nAs of this writing, Novo Nordisk's market cap is about $400 billion. To hit $1 trillion, it would need a CAGR of about 16.5%. That would be an impressive average to maintain for six years, but Novo Nordisk has been more than impressive recently. Brand names like Wegovy and Ozempic have become famous. Both are GLP-1 medicines that treat obesity and diabetes, respectively. Novo Nordisk has been one of the pioneers in the GLP-1 weight loss market, which is now attracting pharmaceutical companies left and right.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts estimate that the weight loss drug market will hit $150 billion by the early 2030s -- it was worth just $24 billion last year. And although there will be plenty of challengers, Novo Nordisk's pipeline in this field is second to none. The company's most promising programs include an oral medicine called amycretin, and CagriSema, which some have estimated could generate as much as $20.2 billion in revenue by 2030.\n\nThat barely scratches the surface of Novo Nordisk's pipeline, though. Semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic) is being tested in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, two areas with high unmet needs. The company is developing several other diabetes and obesity medicines, and a range of treatments for various rare diseases. Novo Nordisk's revenue has grown rapidly during the past five years, as have its stock price and market cap. NVO Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe drugmaker should earn important approvals during the next few years, which will help it continue generating excellent financial results through the end of the decade. Becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2030 is well within Novo Nordisk's reach, and it should continue beating the market beyond that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Visa, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Subtle Reason Stocks Can Plunge if Kamala Harris Raises the Corporate Tax Rate by 33%",
        "content": "Less than a month from today, on Nov. 5, voters will head to the polls to determine which presidential candidate -- current Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump -- will lead our country for the next four years.\n\nAdmittedly, not every decision made in the Oval Office or by our elected officials in Congress has bearing on Wall Street. However, the economic policies put into place by the incoming president and Congress do have the potential to affect corporate profits, and thus the stock market.\n\nWhile there are potential advantages and drawbacks to the economic proposals of both candidates, the one plan that's raising a lot of eyebrows on Wall Street is Harris' call to raise the corporate tax rate by a third -- from 21% to 28%.\n\nAlthough the current U.S. corporate tax rate is at its lowest level since 1939, increasing it by 33% has the potential to set the stock market up for disaster for a very off-the-radar reason. Vice President Kamala Harris speaking with reporters. Image source: Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson.\n\nStocks could plunge if Harris hikes the corporate tax rate -- but not for the reason you might think\n\nKamala Harris' plan to increase taxation on businesses stems from persistent and growing federal deficits.\n\nWith the exception of 1998 through 2001, the federal government has spent more than it has brought in via revenue every year since 1970. The national debt now sits around $35 trillion, with the annual cost to service this debt coming in at roughly $1.05 trillion as of August 2024, per the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This trajectory isn't going to be sustainable over the long term.\n\nBased on estimates from the Treasury Department, increasing the corporate tax rate by a third to 28% would lift federal tax revenue by a cumulative $1.35 trillion over the next decade.\n\nHowever, increasing corporate taxes might have unintended and/or unforeseen consequences for Wall Street.\n\nThe logical expectation if the corporate tax rate climbs is that businesses will have less capital to put toward the meat and potatoes that makes them tick. Specifically, we'll see a slower rate of new hiring, fewer acquisitions, and less in the way of capital spent on research and development. Hiring, acquisitions, and innovation are typically what grow the bottom line for businesses.\n\nBut there's a less-obvious concern that can cause stocks to plunge if the corporate tax rate jumps by 33%. Less available capital to put to work for publicly traded companies might reduce or eliminate what's been a key source of earnings growth in recent years: share buybacks. AAPL Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFor companies with steady or growing net income, share repurchases can boost earnings per share (EPS). As a company's outstanding share count declines over time, its EPS should rise, thereby making it more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis ending in March 2024, S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) companies completed $816.5 billion worth of buybacks, which is technically down from a TTM peak of $1.01 trillion for the period ended June 2022, based on data from S&P Global.\n\nMore importantly, 50.9% of the buybacks completed in the first quarter of 2024 were traced to the 20 largest companies by market cap in the S&P 500. Buybacks have been used to fuel earnings growth for America's largest and most-influential businesses, but this isn't guaranteed to continue if Harris wins in November and has the votes on Capitol Hill to increase the corporate tax rate by a third.\n\nAs an example, the world's largest publicly traded company by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has repurchased $700.6 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013 and reduced its outstanding share count by 42.2% in the process.\n\nIf Apple hadn't bought back a single share over the last 11 years, its consensus EPS for fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30) would be less than $4 and not the current $6.68. Arguably no company's bottom line has been fueled more in recent years by share repurchases than Wall Street's largest public company.\n\nIf there's a silver lining to this concern, it's that a study from Fidelity found that the benchmark S&P 500 rose by an average of 13% following every corporate tax hike since 1950. While this doesn't guarantee that stocks would rise if Harris increased the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, history strongly favors a continuation of the current bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis might be even more worrisome than the prospect of reduced share buybacks\n\nAlthough share repurchases have been artificially increasing EPS for Wall Street's biggest companies for years, and a higher corporate tax rate could slow buyback activity, this might not be the most immediate concern for Wall Street. Rather, a historically pricey stock market could be the catalyst that tips equities into a correction or bear market, regardless of who's elected president on Nov. 5.\n\nTo be fair, there are a lot of ways for investors to measure value, and everyone has differing levels of risk tolerance. But based on readings from the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), we've witnessed only a handful of instances in more than 150 years where stocks have, collectively, been this pricey. The Shiller P/E ratio is also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio.\n\nMost investors rely on the traditional P/E ratio as a quick and easy way to determine if a stock is relatively cheap or pricey when compared to its peers and its own history. However, the traditional P/E ratio only takes TTM earnings into account, which can be skewed or adversely affected by shock events, such as the temporary lockdowns that occurred during the pandemic.\n\nThe Shiller P/E ratio is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Encompassing a full decade of EPS history minimizes the impact of shock events, which leads to a more accurate measure of value. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nWhen the closing bell tolled on Oct. 3, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E stood at 36.6, which is more than double its average reading of 17.16, when back-tested to January 1871. Even though lower interest rates and the internet's democratizing access to information have increased the willingness of everyday investors to take risks, a Shiller P/E of nearly 37 is an outsize reading.\n\nLooking back to 1871, there have been only six total instances where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30 during a bull market rally, including the present. Following the previous five occurrences, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI), and/or Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC), shed between 20% and 89% of their value.\n\nThough the Shiller P/E isn't a timing tool -- i.e., stocks can remain pricey for weeks, months, or in rarer cases multiple years -- it does have a flawless track record of foreshadowing big declines in the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq Composite.\n\nWhile it's possible Kamala Harris' plan to raise the corporate tax rate by 33% would be bad news for Wall Street, the biggest enemy for investors right now is historically expensive stock valuations -- and this is unlikely to change anytime soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors have a lot to celebrate this year, with the S&P 500 gaining 20%. While it's nice to receive high returns, it's also a good time to examine your holdings heading into the new year.\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has underperformed the market by 2 percentage points since the start of the year, increasing 18.3%. However, the company has had a lot of success in the past and richly rewarded shareholders. After all, the company has a $3.5 trillion market capitalization, one of the few that have crossed the trillion-dollar threshold.\n\nCan Apple's shares regain their market-beating ways? The answer lies in examining the company's long-term prospects and valuation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCan a new phone revitalize sales growth?\n\nApple's iPhone accounts for a large portion of the company's sales. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, which ended on June 29, the product represented 52% of Apple's $296.1 billion top line.\n\nFacing intensifying competition, including from China-based Huawei, iPhone sales have been dropping, In the most recent quarter, they were down 1% to $39.3 billion.\n\nMore troubling is that the product has also been losing market share. Apple's iPhones accounted for 15.8% of smartphone shipments in the second quarter, down from 17.3% in the previous quarter. A year ago, it held a 16% share.\n\nApple recently released a new version of the iPhone that it hopes can reverse the trend. It has new features, including artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Whether that will cause existing customers to upgrade to the expensive models or cause users to switch to an iPhone remains unclear, however. It's too early to make a judgment on how the new features will impact the top line. Although initial sales reportedly have been disappointing, investors should have more information when Apple reports quarterly earnings in about a month.\n\nCan services sustain growth?\n\nOne bright spot for Apple remains sales from providing services. These include advertising, supporting products, cloud services, the App Store, and payments.\n\nIn the latest quarter, service sales grew 14.1% to $24.2 billion. And this category has a much higher gross margin than products, 74% versus 35.3%.\n\nHowever, the U.S. government and several states have claimed Apple's iPhone has an illegal monopoly that makes it too difficult for consumers to switch phones and develop apps. This could result in a drawn-out process, and the outcome remains uncertain. The cases have the potential to hurt Apple's service business' profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, after a dearth of brand-new product categories, Vision Pro, its widely publicized product launched earlier this year, doesn't seem to have gained much traction. With a high price tag for the combined augmented and virtual reality headset, sales seem to have been disappointing. Management now expects to sell 450,000 units in the first year, well below its initial 800,000 estimate.\n\nThe decision\n\nThe shares' gain over the last year has led to a richer valuation. Apple's stock has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34 compared to about 28 a year ago.\n\nThe stock also sells at a higher multiple than the S&P 500's P/E of 30 , making it more expensive than the overall market. The S&P 500 makes a good comparison since it's comprised of large-cap stocks.\n\nA higher valuation might seem warranted if Apple had better-than-market growth expectations. However, its main product, the iPhone, has been slumping, and it's unclear if its new phone version can stem this slide. The new AI feature doesn't seem likely to provide a long-term competitive edge since others seem likely to quickly incorporate something similar.\n\nAlong with a government investigation and unclear prospects for its newest product, I'd steer clear and sell any Apple shares you may hold.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Right now, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the world's largest company by market cap. However, investors need to be aware of some problems under the hood.\n\nInstead of Apple, I think there are much better buys right now, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). These three provide significant long-term upside that should allow them to outperform Apple.\n\nWhat's going on with Apple?\n\nApple reached the top of the rankings of the world's largest companies with shockingly low revenue growth. Sales of iPhones haven't increased meaningfully since the pandemic began, and investors put a lot of hope into the iPhone 16 being the generation that turns it around, mainly because of its Apple Intelligence integration. But the latest reports say that its sales are below expectations, which could spell disaster for the stock.\n\nIt trades at 34 times trailing earnings and 31 times forward earnings. That's a premium investors would expect to pay for a company that's growing rapidly. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn Apple's latest quarter, however, sales only grew by 4.9% and earnings per share (EPS) by 10.2%. Those aren't figures that support the stock's lofty valuation.\n\nThe immediate future looks slightly better, but not enough to justify today's price. In fiscal 2025, ending Sept. 30, 2025, Wall Street expects 8% higher revenue and 17% EPS growth. Compared to the following three options, Apple stock doesn't look attractive.\n\nThese tech stocks look to outperform Apple over the next few years\n\nInstead, I would urge you to consider Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (and many other companies as well).\n\nLet's start with Nvidia. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering artificial intelligence (AI), and demand doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.\n\nAlphabet is Google's parent company, and its market dominance among search engines allowed it to capitalize on advertising in one of the most lucrative areas on the internet.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, and it also generates a lot of its money from ads on its platforms.\n\nAll three of these companies are far outperforming Apple in revenue and EPS growth. NVDA Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite doing substantially better than Apple, two of them don't hold a premium in comparison to it, while Nvidia isn't that much more expensive. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAs an investor, I'm looking for companies with sustainable business models, faster growth, and lower stock valuations. Compared to Apple, both Meta and Alphabet achieve that, so buying those two instead makes a lot of sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia isn't cheaper now, but its prospects are far more lucrative. While its days of increasing revenue at a triple-digit pace are over, if it keeps up its current rate, it will still post impressive growth.\n\nIn its 2025 second quarter (ending July 28), Nvidia grew revenue 15% sequentially, and its third-quarter projections indicate sales will rise another 8.3% over the previous period. Apple can't muster this kind of increase year over year, yet Nvidia is doing it one quarter after another.\n\nIf the stock price doesn't move, this will rapidly drive down Nvidia's valuation. However, with AI being such a hot investment topic, the stock will continue to be strong and will likely maintain its premium over other tech stocks.\n\nAs a result, its stock performance will be closely tied to its revenue and EPS growth, which will easily allow it to outperform the iPhone maker.\n\nApple is a great company, but it isn't the juggernaut it used to be. Investors should start looking for other investment opportunities.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Bank of America recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $256. In a research note on the firm, the advisory noted that tracking of iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website, and various carrier websites, indicated that as of October 2, or 20 days after preorders started, ship time in days for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models were extended, but somewhat less, on average, compared to prior years. Globally, per the advisory, on average, ship time for the iPhone 16 Pro was currently at 13 days, while iPhone 16 Pro Max stood at 20 days. The note detailed that the initial demand for the phones could be lower due to the unavailability of Apple Intelligence at launch, but would pick up after the AI features were available.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "Talking yourself into buying stocks priced at highs isn't easy. It's even tougher when a stock is outright soaring. The risk of an imminent correction just feels too great.\n\nSometimes, though, the reason for a rally -- and the odds of it continuing -- are bigger than the risk. To this end, here's a closer look at three soaring stocks I'd buy without a second thought. There's still more than enough upside potential on the table to justify taking a swing at their lofty levels.\n\n1. Costco Wholesale\n\nIf membership-based retailer Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) has an effective limit to its reach, it's nowhere in sight. The company now boasts 76.2 million paid memberships, providing 136.8 million total cardholders the right to enter its stores, up 7.3% year over year for the three-month stretch ending in early September. That's yet another record.\n\nGranted, the penetration of new markets helped. In addition to opening 10 new stores in the United States during the quarter in question, it opened another four outside the U.S. There's no slowdown on the horizon, either. Costco plans on opening 26 new locales in the fiscal year that just got underway, pushing its count up to 916 stores. About half of these openings will be overseas.\n\nBeing able to deliver real value here and abroad, however, is the biggest driver of this growth.\n\nPeople all over the developed world are becoming more cost-effective shoppers. A poll performed by YouGov last year indicates that in the wake of soaring inflation, 94% of the planet's consumers made a point of employing money-saving tactics when making purchases. More price comparisons and couponing were the most-newly embraced approaches, but switching stores as well as switching brands were popular strategies as well. Given that costs of discretionary goods as well as consumer staples have only grown since then, the sentiment certainly still applies.\n\nIt's a dynamic that plays right into the hand Costco is holding. While buying in bulk hasn't always been everyone's preferred method of shopping for basic goods, when budgets are stretched as tightly as they are now -- and likely will be for the foreseeable future -- consumers are willing to adapt.\n\nThat's what the analyst community appears to believe, anyway. They're expecting Costco Wholesale's top line to grow by more than 7% this fiscal year, and improve by nearly as much again next year. This is the key reason Costco shares are just off of record highs hit in early September.\n\n2. Toast\n\nThe restaurant business is not only wildly competitive, but incredibly complicated. Restaurant managers routinely deal with short-lived employees, constantly depleted supplies, regulatory inspections, and (hopefully) a steady flow of new customers. In the midst of the madness, they're also supposed to improve and grow their restaurant's revenue. It's a lot to tackle!\n\nStory continues\n\nA company called Toast(NYSE: TOST) makes it all at least a little easier to manage.\n\nIn simplest terms, Toast offers software built from the ground up to specifically serve the restaurant industry. From point-of-sale solutions to online ordering to payroll to marketing, Toast can handle it all. These tools are all integrated into a singular platform, too, making it easy and fast to use them all.\n\nAnd to date, 120,000 different restaurants are utilizing the Toast platform. For perspective, there are over 700,000 restaurants in the United States alone. Clearly there's a multitude more outside the U.S., which are just as addressable by Toast as domestic restaurants are.\n\nRestaurants are signing up in droves, too. Toast's top line improved 27% during the second quarter of this year, extending growth trends that are likely to persist at least for a few more years. At its current growth trajectory, the company's expected to swing to a full-year profit in 2025 -- one of the reasons shares recently reached a new 52-week high, more than doubling its value in less than a year.\n\nBut it's a business model with a limited lifespan? Not so fast.\n\nToast's software is rented rather than outright purchased. Its customers are gladly willing to pay this ongoing fee, however, since it provides them with a constantly updated cloud-based platform that meets their unique business needs. Toast is very much a partner with its customers, growing its top and bottom lines as restaurants themselves grow theirs.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of soaring stocks to buy. Like Costco, it recently reached a record high, and is up more than 300% for the past five years.\n\nThere's arguably more upside in store dead ahead, though.\n\nYes, this call has everything to do with the recent launch of the iPhone 16 that's capable of handling generative artificial intelligence (AI) functions directly from the device itself (as opposed to punting this work to the cloud, which is where most of it is currently handled). While some concern has been raised about the tepid initial demand for the latest iteration of the popular smartphone, that doesn't eliminate the prospect of a so-called supercycle eventually whipping up some serious demand for the device.\n\nIt could just take some time for consumers to come around; they may be waiting for the early reviews of the tech. Indeed, the software that turns the latest iPhones into full-blown artificial intelligence devices isn't even available yet, and even once it is, the rollout will be gradual in terms of features as well as regions. All this means there's no particular hurry to purchase new iPhones just yet, if AI is the motivating force.\n\nThere's also no doubt that consumer interest in such a tool is real. Technology market research outfit IDC anticipates worldwide sales of more than 230 million generative AI-capable smartphones this year alone, en route to over 900 million such devices in 2028, when this tech will be the norm.\n\nGiven Apple's brand notoriety, it's arguably better positioned than any other player to capture more than its fair share of this growth.\n\nMore (along with more engaged) iPhone owners of course means sales of more apps, streaming music, and streaming video from Apple's app store. This in turn translates into more services revenue, which at more than 70% boasts considerably higher gross profit margin rates than the 37% gross profit margin rate on sales of iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\n\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months — five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently penned an investor note on the company, maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $265. In the note, Chatterjee highlighted that the iPhone 16 had been available to consumers for a little over a week and the launch was lacking early momentum for the high-end models when compared to prior cycles. Per the analyst, the difference in the lead times relative to prior years in the early weeks pointed to more muted momentum in early orders for the Pro models relative to original expectations. Chatterjee noted this was likely due to the unavailability of artificial intelligence capabilities, with consumers likely delaying purchases until the features were available and the value proposition was better understood.\n\nJPMorgan thus moderated the near-term Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone unit forecast. The advisory now expects aggregate iPhone volumes to track to 126 million in the second half of 2024 versus 130 million prior and 132 million a year ago. However, the analyst clarified that expectations for a robust AI cycle in the medium-term were unchanged, and the revision in near-term estimates only represented a modest push out from volumes to later in the cycle.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Other factors included looking at the fund managers more concerned with the fundamentals of the businesses they invest in over short-term share prices, as well as the longevity of the manager.\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, said: \"If anyone is rushing to load up their ISA and SIPP to beat any budget tax changes, remember the 30 October deadline only applies to the contribution into the tax wrapper.\"\n\nThis meant that investors \"can then take their time to make their investment choices,\" he added.\n\nNew 'best funds' to invest in\n\nAdditions to Bestinvest's latest Best Funds List, which is published twice a year, include:\n\nLiontrust European Dynamic (0P00006TQM.L) invests in European companies such as Danish jewellery brand Pandora (PNDORA.CO) and Zara-owner Inditex (ITX.MC).\n\nIt has generated a return of 13% over one year, below its benchmark the MSCI Europe ex-UK index, up 15%, but has beaten the benchmark's 16% over three years, with a return of 29%.\n\nM&G Japan (0P0000WN42.L) holds Japanese companies such as major corporations Mitsubishi (8058.T) and Sony (6758.T).\n\nThe fund has delivered a return of 10% over one-year, versus an 11% gain in the MSCI Japan index, but has returned 8% over three years against a 3% rise in the benchmark.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock Gold & General (0P0000KANP.L) invests in gold miners. Investments include Canadian company Barrick Gold (GOLD) and US mining giant Newmont Corporation (NEM). Over one-year the fund produced a total return of 38%, versus a 41% gain in its FTSE gold mining index benchmark.\n\nGold prices have soared recently amid escalating geopolitical tensions and lingering concerns the global economy, with the spot price at $2,649 per ounce on Thursday afternoon.\n\nFunds that have dropped out of Best Funds List\n\nJanus Henderson Strategic Bond (0P00008F8P.L) holds fixed income such as UK and US, known as gilts and Treasuries. While the fund offers a yield of 3.7%, it has produced a return of 8% over the past year, which is slightly behind the average of 11% among its peers in the IA Strategic Bond sector.\n\nCT Responsible Global Equity (0P0001BHCZ.L) is another that didn't quite make the cut this time round. The fund aims to invest in companies that offer sustainable solutions or make positive contributions to society. Tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are among its top investments.\n\nDespite the gains in such tech stocks year, the fund has not managed to beat its comparator benchmark, the MSCI World index over the last year. It has returned 18% over one-year, versus a 21% rise in the index.\n\nUK-focused funds\n\nArtemis UK Select (0P0000V25A.L) was one fund in the UK equities growth space that remained on the best funds list.\n\nThe fund aims to grow investor capital over five years by investing in a portfolio of small, medium and large UK companies. Stocks in the portfolio include banks Barclays (BARC.L) and NatWest (NWG.L), as well as housebuilder Vistry Group (VTY.L).\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nArtemis UK Select has returned 27% over the past year, beating the FTSE All-Share tracker index's 17%.\n\nBestinvest said in the report that fund manager Ed Legget \"looks below the surface of a company’s financial statements to establish a forward-looking view on its health and prospects\".\n\nNorth American-focused funds\n\nIn the group of North American-focused funds, US Premier Miton Opportunities (0P0000XOCD.L) also stayed on the list.\n\nThe fund invests in US companies across all sectors and sizes, with top holdings including card operator Visa (V) and investment bank Raymond James Financial (RJF).\n\nThe fund has underperformed its sector over the last year, with a return of nearly 11%, versus an average of 19% in IA North America sector. However, it has returned 328% since launch in 2013, beating the sector average of 309%.\n\nRead more: How to minimise a capital gains tax impact on your investments\n\n\"We like this fund for its multi-cap approach to the biggest economy in the world and its diversity of sectors and industries,\" Bestinvest said.\n\nEthical and sustainable funds\n\nFor those investors looking for ethical and sustainable funds, Baillie Gifford Responsible Global Equity Income (0P0001J8P1.L) is among those that Bestinvest highlighted.\n\nInvestments include diabetes drug specialist Novo Nordisk (NOVO-B.CO), tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) and heating and air conditioning group Watsco (WSO).\n\nThe fund has generated a return of 12% over the last year, though it has failed to keep up its MSCI ACWI benchmark index, which is up nearly 20%. However, the fund offers a yield of 2% and Bestinvest said that it has shown itself to be a \"compelling option for income-seeking investors\".\n\n\"We believe the fund could be a natural addition for responsible portfolios and has one of the lowest fees in the sector,\" Bestinvest said, with an ongoing charge of 0.54%.\n\nTo read the full rundown of which funds made Bestinvest's latest 'Best Funds List' click on this link.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "What's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy With the Fed Cutting Rates?",
        "content": "Interest rates are at long last coming down as the Federal Reserve announced a significant 0.5% rate cut in September. More reductions in the interest rate are likely on the way.\n\nLower rates are usually viewed as good news for smaller businesses. However, they benefit huge corporations, too, including the market-leading group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. What's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with the Fed cutting rates?\n\nHow rate cuts could benefit the Magnificent Seven\n\nLet's first look at how lower interest rates could help the members of the Magnificent Seven. Three ways are the most important, in my view.\n\nFirst (and most obvious), lower interest rates reduce Magnificent Seven companies' borrowing costs. This makes it cheaper to refinance maturing debt. They also enable companies to fund new projects that could lead to future growth.\n\nSecond, lower rates can boost customer spending. This can happen whether the customers are individual consumers or organizations.\n\nThird, lower interest rates can lead to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. This benefits Magnificent Seven companies that export to other countries by making their products more competitive in international markets.\n\nEvaluating the Magnificent Seven\n\nRate cuts should help all of the Magnificent Seven stocks. However, some will benefit more than others.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has the most debt on its books in the group -- $157.8 billion. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trail behind with debt of $101.3 billion and $97.8 billion, respectively. Lower rates could help these companies the most when it comes to reducing interest expenses when their debt matures (assuming rates are still lower at that point).\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are in the middle of the pack, with debt totaling nearly $38 billion and $28.7 billion, respectively. Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) debt load is only $12.5 billion, while Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) debt of $10 billion is the lowest of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nI suspect that increases in customer spending fueled by lower interest rates would likely be most pronounced for the companies with the most expensive products. Tesla's electric vehicles can cost in the ballpark of $40,000 at the lowest, with the pricey models costing over $113,000.\n\nCompanies spend significant amounts to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), too. Lower rates could especially help start-ups and smaller businesses afford to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) development efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft operate cloud service platforms that could benefit from increased customer spending, driven by lower rates. All three companies market consumer products that could see sales increase, as well. It's the same story for Apple and, to a lesser extent, Meta.\n\nApple and Tesla would arguably be helped the most by a weaker U.S. dollar. Sales outside the U.S. are greater for both companies than their U.S. sales. However, all of the other Magnificent Seven also have significant international sales.\n\nThe best Magnificent Seven stock to buy with falling rates\n\nI think that Amazon and Tesla will probably be helped the most by the Fed's rate cuts. Which is the better stock to buy? I'd go with Amazon.\n\nTesla is much more expensive than Amazon based on forward earnings multiples and facing increasing competition. Even worse, consumer interest in electric vehicles seems to be waning.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's AWS cloud platform has a massive AI tailwind at its back. Advertising on Prime Video has become an important new growth driver for the company. Amazon's technology investments should continue to pay off in increased profitability for its e-commerce business. Project Kuiper, a new satellite internet service, is poised to be another new source of growth.\n\nAll of these would be positives for Amazon without lower interest rates. However, lower rates should put an extra bounce in the company's step -- and send its stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google to begin organizing some search results using AI, bringing ads to AI Overview",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is bringing some big AI updates to its main Search platform and Google Lens visual search software. On Thursday the company announced it will start rolling out AI organized search results pages for users in the U.S. The tech giant also says it’s bringing the ability to search for information about live videos you shoot to its Lens app. Google says Lens is one of its fastest growing types of search and is especially popular with users between 18 and 24.\n\nImportantly for both investors and advertisers, Google also said it’s adding ads to its AI-powered AI Overview in Search, as well as an updated look for AI Overview that the company says will improve traffic to linked websites.\n\nThe updates are part of Google’s broader effort to further monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies.\n\nGoogle says its AI organized search results will be available to users with queries related to open-ended answers or responses without one true correct response. That, at first, will begin with recipes and meal inspiration in mobile search.\n\nGoogle says the feature provides more “content and perspectives from across the web” and that in testing users found AI-generated search results to be more helpful in general. Google will begin organizing some search results using its AI technologies. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nGoogle’s Lens update is similarly interesting, with Google saying you’ll be able to open the app, hold down the shutter button, and ask questions using voice about moving objects you see in front of you. In one example Google says you’ll be able to point your phone’s camera at a school of fish and ask why they’re all swimming in a circle.\n\nThe company previewed the technology at its I/O developer conference in May, showing how you’d be able to point your phone’s camera at a record player and ask it why its arm keeps moving off of the record. In the pre-recorded demo, Lens pulled up an AI Overview response explaining what might be wrong with the player and standard search results identifying its model number.\n\nThe feature is only available for Search Lab users via the Google app and only supports English questions for now. But if it proves reliable when it’s released to a wider user base, it’s easy to see how Lens with video could be useful for users who want to ask simple questions about things like home repairs and more.\n\nLens is also getting some updates for its shopping feature including access to Google’s Shopping Graph, which the company says will provide users with prices of items you take photos of using the app, reviews of those products, and where you can buy them.\n\nVisual search is one of the next major AI battlegrounds for tech companies. Google’s Lens app has been around for years. The company debuted its Circle to Search function, which lets you snap a picture and circle an item or object you want to learn more about, earlier this year.\n\nStory continues Google is bringing ads to its AI Overview feature. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nApple (AAPL) is also looking to get in on the visual search game later this year with its visual intelligence feature for iPhones with the new Camera Control button. Like Google Lens and Circle to Search, visual intelligence will identify objects and places you view using your phone’s camera, though Apple doesn’t mention if it will work with video.\n\nIn addition to updates to Search and Lens, Google says it’s officially bringing ads to U.S. AI Overview users. The company says it’s seen positive feedback in testing ads in AI Overview and that they’ve helped users quickly connect with businesses related to their search queries.\n\nThat’s sure to keep investors and advertisers happy, as both groups were initially hesitant about how AI Overview might impact how Google displays its ads in search results. Advertising is still Google’s biggest business, despite gains in its cloud computing segment, and is likely to continue to dominate as its biggest revenue stream for the foreseeable future.\n\nGetting ads right in AI Overview is of the utmost importance for Google, as it continues to expand its generative AI technologies across its various platforms. Search is still Google’s most popular business, but adding gen. AI to apps like YouTube will also need careful consideration so as not to annoy users or advertisers.

        "content": "Ōura launched its latest smart ring Thursday and gave its mobile app a complete overhaul — as the company faces increasing competition from tech giants such as Samsung and Apple (AAPL).\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 promises to be more comfortable and provide more accurate health data than the company’s previous rings, with slimmer sensors and an updated algorithm.\n\nThe new smart ring is available now for preorder at $349 and will start shipping on Oct. 15. Customers will also need to sign up for a monthly ($5.99) or yearly ($69.99) membership with the company; purchase of the new ring comes with a free month.\n\n“Oura Ring is designed to be a personal health companion, giving our members a holistic view of their health by pairing personal data with meaningful, actionable insights to facilitate long-term changes,” said Ōura CEO Tom Hale in a press release.\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is set to provide more accurate tracking of sleep, exercise, stress, heart health, and other metrics via “Smart Sensing.” The company says the new tech is powered through an “algorithm that works alongside the research-grade sensors” and is able to “respond to each member’s unique finger physiology.”\n\nThe data collected by the ring will then be presented on a redesigned mobile app that helps customers “navigate the bigger picture of their health while also making it easy to dive into the details when they’re ready.”\n\nThe Finland-based company is a pioneer in the smart ring market and has sold over 2.5 million rings since its 2013 founding. Oura, the smart ring market leader, currently holds 52% of the market.\n\nŌura’s newest ring launches as the company is facing growing competition from tech giants Samsung and Apple, which are getting into the medical device market.\n\nIn July, Samsung launched a direct competitor to the Oura Ring: theGalaxy Ring.\n\nAnd more recently, in August, Apple announced its newest AirPods Pro 2 will include a scientifically validated hearing test and a clinical-grade hearing aid feature.\n\nAdditionally, Apple said its smartwatch devices will now be able to notify users if they are showing signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea via a new algorithm that analyzes breathing disturbance data.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he’s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed’s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\n“The fact is, and I’ve said this for a long time, I won’t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.”\n\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\n“If you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we’re in now, in 2024.\n\nThe basic belief that central bank hikes are bad for stocks was wrong from the start because it was already priced in. As soon as central bank hikes were visible, the market had already accounted for them. We saw a bull market begin in October 2022, which has continued despite repeated rate hikes.”\n\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s hedge fund’s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Facing Lower iPhone 16 Shipments and Shorter Wait Times?\n\nbrandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplash\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s Stake: $12,111,286,431\n\nInitial numbers on Apple’s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n\n“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. “On average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.”\n\nIn the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they’re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nAlmost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n\nHowever, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher’s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRockand AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\n\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\n\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Bank of America recently released an investor note on the company, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $256. In the note, the advisory discussed the several avenues for monetization within the services strategy for Apple, arguing that revenue from downloads of apps using AI on the Apple App Store and the potential for a subscription-based platform for Apple Intelligence itself once Apple AI was further developed had been analyzed and undoubtedly presented a large-scale revenue opportunity for Apple.\n\nAnalysts at the bank further noted that Siri integration monetization was one we find the most overlooked and had the potential to become very significant over time. According to the bank, deep Siri integration with apps could drive $3 billion in revenues in 2026 and could approach about $50 billion in a decade for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Magnificent Oil Stock Instead",
        "content": "Warren Buffett finally did it. After making a monster investment in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) many years ago and watching it appreciate by multiples of his cost basis, the legendary investor is trimming Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.B) stake. According to filings with the SEC, Buffett has sold approximately half of Berkshire's stake in Apple, raising around $80 billion in cash. Yes, that's how big a winner Apple was for the company.\n\nWhat is he doing with all this cash? The largest stock purchase for Berkshire Hathaway in the second quarter was Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Here's why he is selling Apple and buying this oil stock instead.\n\nExpanding Apple valuation\n\nApple has made its investors a fortune over the last few decades. After releasing the revolutionary iPhone -- perhaps the most successful single product in history -- its stock has generated huge returns for shareholders. Total return in the last 10 years alone is close to 1,000%.\n\nWhile that is all fine and dandy, today the company is seeing stagnating revenue growth amid market saturation for smartphones. Revenue has essentially been flat over the last few years as fewer people have upgraded to new iPhones, which is the only true needle mover for the company. It has struggled to innovate and convince people to buy new phones while battling a consumer recession in China. Recent products such as the Apple Vision Pro look like flops so far, and the company has fallen behind in artificial intelligence to competitor Alphabet.\n\nStagnating sales are coupled with an expanded earnings multiple. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is now closing in on 35, which is wildly expensive for a low-growth business. Given Buffett's intense focus on valuation in his investment process, it is no surprise to see him unloading his shares in the iPhone maker. The upside doesn't look too appetizing at these levels.\n\nA cheap oil stock?\n\nBuffett's biggest purchase last quarter was in Occidental Petroleum. Berkshire Hathaway owns a whopping 27.25% of Occidental's outstanding shares, making it the largest shareholder by far in the company.\n\nWhy is Buffett attracted to the stock? First and foremost is the valuation. Oil and gas companies have been neglected by investors for years as they focus on exciting technology companies. Occidental Petroleum trades at a P/E of 12.6, which is around one-third that of Apple. The company is one of the largest oil producers in the United States, with over 82% of its production coming from domestic sources. This makes it less risky than other oil companies that have to deal with adversarial foreign governments.\n\nOccidental can also play as a hedge for oil prices. Rising oil prices can be inflationary and affect other parts of the economy and the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. If oil prices rise, Occidental Petroleum will benefit, but likely hurt the earnings power of Berkshire's railroad subsidiary by increasing input costs. This way, Berkshire Hathaway is playing both sides of the situation. No matter what happens, it comes out on top.\n\nEven better for Buffett, Occidental trades at a cheap P/E when oil prices are falling. The current level for crude oil is $68 a barrel, which is well off the highs of around $100 a barrel or higher in 2022. If the price of oil starts to rise again, Occidental's earnings power will rise too. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nA lesson in the risk-free rate\n\nWith his selling of Apple and buying of Occidental Petroleum, Buffett is giving investors an important lesson in the risk-free rate and how it can affect your investing decisions.\n\nToday, Berkshire Hathaway has a cash pile approaching $300 billion sitting in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. These bills earn around 5% in yield every year and can be considered the risk-free rate for investors. Why? Because you can compare them to the earnings yield of other stocks in your portfolio.\n\nAn earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E and tells you how much in earnings you are yielding each year from a company, based on the current stock price. Apple's earnings are not growing, and it has a P/E of close to 35. Invert that P/E, and you have an earnings yield of 2.9%. Buffett is saying he would rather own Treasury bills than get a 2.9% yield owning Apple stock.\n\nBut what if we look at Occidental Petroleum's earnings yield? Take one divided by 12.6, and its earnings yield is 7.9%. That is much higher than the current Treasury yield. While it's not the entire story for any stock, comparing the earnings yield to the risk-free rate is a good way to gauge whether you should buy the stock. This likely came into consideration when Buffett was selling Apple and buying shares of Occidental Petroleum.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Probably Missed.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed that Apple is poised to unveil a new version of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset next year. In a blog post, the analyst noted that the new product would go into mass production in the second-half of 2025 and will be powered by the M5 chip, as the tech giant aims to create a better Apple Intelligence user experience on the device. Per the analyst, if Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) integrates advanced AI models like Sora by OpenAI into the Vision Pro, the impact of text-to-video AI models on the head-mounted display device experience will likely be more impressive than on existing mainstream consumer electronics.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares",
        "content": "Overview of the Recent Transaction\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Vanguard Group Inc made a significant addition to its investment portfolio by acquiring 251,533 shares of Veracyte Inc (NASDAQ:VCYT), a leader in genomic diagnostics. This transaction increased Vanguard's total holdings in the company to 7,748,514 shares, reflecting a substantial investment in the medical diagnostics sector. The shares were purchased at a price of $34.04 each, marking a strategic move by the firm to bolster its position in the healthcare industry.\n\nProfile of Vanguard Group Inc\n\nFounded in 1975 by John C. Bogle, Vanguard Group Inc has grown into one of the world's leading investment management firms, renowned for its low-cost mutual funds and ETFs. The firm operates under a unique client-owned structure, which allows it to focus on delivering high returns at minimal costs to its investors. Vanguard's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term, cost-effective fund management, making it a preferred choice for millions of investors globally. The firm's top holdings include giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), showcasing its focus on technology and financial services sectors.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with VCYT. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares\n\nDetailed Analysis of the Trade\n\nThe recent acquisition by Vanguard has increased its stake in Veracyte Inc to 10.08% of the total shares outstanding, making it a significant shareholder in the company. This move is part of Vanguard's strategy to invest in high-growth sectors such as medical diagnostics and research, where Veracyte Inc is a key player. The addition of these shares has a minimal immediate impact on Vanguard's vast portfolio, representing just 0.01% of its total investments, but it strategically positions Vanguard in a high-potential market.\n\nInsight into Veracyte Inc\n\nVeracyte Inc specializes in genomic diagnostics with a focus on diseases like thyroid cancer, lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The company's innovative products, including Afirma, Percepta, and Envisia, have set it apart in the biopharmaceutical sector. Despite being fairly valued with a GF Value of $31.58 and a price to GF Value ratio of 1.06, Veracyte shows robust growth prospects with a GF Score of 82/100, indicating good potential for outperformance. Vanguard Group Inc's Strategic Acquisition of Veracyte Inc Shares\n\nMarket Impact and Comparative Industry Analysis\n\nVeracyte's market capitalization stands at $2.58 billion, with a year-to-date stock price increase of 22.63%. The company operates within the competitive Medical Diagnostics & Research industry, where it has managed to maintain a strong growth rank of 9/10. However, its profitability rank is relatively low at 3/10, suggesting areas for improvement. Veracyte's strategic focus on expanding its diagnostic product range and enhancing technological capabilities positions it well for future growth within the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Notable Investors and Industry Context\n\nApart from Vanguard, other prominent investors like Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio) have also invested in Veracyte, indicating strong investor confidence in the company's business model and growth trajectory. Baron Funds remains the largest shareholder, underscoring the attractiveness of Veracyte in the investment community.\n\nConclusion\n\nVanguard Group Inc's recent acquisition of Veracyte Inc shares is a strategic enhancement to its investment portfolio, particularly in the burgeoning field of medical diagnostics. This transaction not only underscores Vanguard's commitment to investing in high-growth industries but also positions it to benefit from Veracyte's potential market gains and technological advancements in genomic diagnostics. As the industry evolves, this move could significantly influence future valuations and investor interest in Veracyte Inc.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Microsoft wants to change the way you use your PC. It needs to succeed.",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) wants you to talk to your computer. No, not by swearing at it when your boss schedules another 8 a.m. meeting. Rather, the tech giant wants you to have actual back-and-forth conversations with your laptop.\n\nDubbed Copilot Voice and available as part of Microsoft’s latest Copilot AI platform update, the software feature is designed to let you speak directly to your PC and for it to talk back to you.\n\n“We think that Copilot Voice is going to be really a big unlock in terms of how you interface with technology,” Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“We now have the most advanced AI models that are really fast. So this is not like the old ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘Hello, Alexa,’” Mehdi said, explaining that Copilot’s AI offers more impressive voice recognition capabilities.\n\nIn addition to voice, Microsoft is working on a feature called Copilot Vision that will allow Copilot to see what you’re doing on your screen and answer questions and make suggestions based on the content you’re viewing. Copilot Vision is only available to select Copilot Pro subscribers for the moment, but Microsoft plans to roll it out to all users in the future. Microsoft's new Click to Do option provides you with a context-sensitive toolbox for taking actions related to what you're viewing on your screen. (Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nTaken together, Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision hold the promise of a major shift in how we use our PCs and a means for Microsoft to potentially boost PC sales as it continues to ramp up its consumer AI push via its Copilot+PC effort.\n\nBut the company is facing ever-growing competition from longtime rivals Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL), which already offer or are preparing to debut their own AI features. And if Copilot doesn’t catch on among consumers, it could leave an enormous blemish on Microsoft’s efforts to be the go-to AI company.\n\nA computer that can see what you see\n\nBeing able to chat with an AI assistant isn’t exactly a wildly new feature. Apple and Google already offer AI helpers that you can speak to, as does Amazon. And with their latest upgrades, Apple's and Google’s offerings should provide the kind of natural-sounding responses that Microsoft’s Copilot does.\n\nBut it’s Copilot’s ability to see what you’re doing on your screen and then talk about that content with you that’s truly intriguing. Copilot Vision is designed to work with Microsoft’s Edge browser and allow you to have discussions with your computer about what new shows to watch when you’re bored.\n\nIn a demo Microsoft showed off, Copilot and an off-screen user talked about the available shows and movies on the website Rotten Tomatoes and which ones the user might enjoy. The conversation seemed natural enough, though how well the feature works in the real world versus a quick demo remains to be seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, it’s easy to see how Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision could change how you use your PC. Imagine dropping a few numbers into a spreadsheet and telling Copilot to put them into an attractive chart or playing an Xbox game and asking Copilot how to get past a particularly difficult boss. That’s the direction Microsoft is heading with these technologies.\n\nAnd while talking to your computer should prove useful, the company says it has no plans to get rid of the classic keyboard and mouse. Rather, Microsoft says the new features will complement the trusted input devices.\n\nMicrosoft isn’t just giving Copilot a voice and vision, though. According to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, the company wants to give its AI the ability to take actions on your behalf.\n\n“It might proactively reach out to you with a reminder or a word of encouragement on your big day. It might help schedule something for you. It might proactively buy something,” Suleyman explained during a press event announcing Copilot Vision on Tuesday.\n\n“Fundamentally, all of these interfaces are about to be represented by different kinds of conversational AI. And so that's the big paradigm shift we're making,” Suleyman added.\n\nMicrosoft has major competition, and one big disadvantage\n\nBut as interesting as Microsoft’s AI features are, they’re largely meant for the PC. Yes, Microsoft offers a Copilot app for smartphone users, but Android and Apple’s iPhone have their own native AI helpers. And chances are users will stick with those rather than download the Copilot app. Apple's rival Apple Intelligence running on an iPhone. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nThat puts Microsoft at a significant disadvantage in the AI wars. That’s because consumers use their smartphones far more than they use their laptops or desktops. Heck, chances are you’re reading this very article on your smartphone.\n\nThat means users will spend more time interacting with Apple's and Google’s offerings than Microsoft’s Copilot. Microsoft will undoubtedly benefit from the fact that its Copilot software is also built into its enterprise offerings, but on the consumer side, it will face an uphill battle when it comes to taking on Google’s Gemini and Apple’s Apple Intelligence.\n\nGoogle is also aiming to roll out its own AI vision software called Project Astra that will allow users' smartphones to see and understand the world around them. Apple is also working on a similar feature. But Apple’s AI platform is still in its early stages, with the company set to roll out more features in the coming months and across 2025.\n\nMicrosoft also has the benefit of its relationship with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which will help boost the Windows maker’s portfolio of AI offerings. But the company will need to ensure its AI efforts take off among consumers before Google or Apple steal the spotlight.\n\nIf it can’t do that and it doesn’t deliver on its promises of making your laptop speak, its AI services could end up in danger of going the way of another famous Microsoft helper: the long-gone Clippy assistant for Microsoft Office.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has completed a deal to raise over $6.5 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a more than $150 billion valuation, and bolstering its efforts to build the world’s leading generative AI technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities A Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda’s Capital City New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century The Corner Store Comeback\n\nThe deal is one of the largest-ever private investments, and makes OpenAI one of the three largest venture-backed startups, alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The size of the investment underscores the tech industry’s belief in the power of AI, and its appetite for the extremely costly research powering its advancement.\n\nThe funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, Bloomberg previously reported, along with other global investors.\n\nThe massive funding round follows a turbulent year for OpenAI. Last November, the company’s board fired and then quickly rehired its Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone’s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\n\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Latest reports, published by finance publication The Wall Street Journal, indicate that the company has dropped out of taking part in an investment round for AI startup OpenAI. The startup is reportedly worth more than $100 billion and is backed by several tech giants, including Apple rival Microsoft.\n\nPreviously, it had been reported that Microsoft, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA had all discussed joining the capital raise for the startup, which was valued at around $86 billion in a funding round held earlier this year. Microsoft was set to invest $1 billion into the startup, bringing total investment in OpenAI to around $13 billion. Venture capital firm Thrive Capital, which is leading the latest funding round, is also likely to invest more than $1 billion into the AI startup.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) settled a class-action lawsuit earlier this year, alleging that the tech company misled or failed to disclose information to investors. As the deadline approaches for shareholders to make a claim for compensation, here's what you need to know about the case.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that between 2 November 2018 and 2 January 2019, Apple made \"materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information regarding Apple's business and prospects\", according to an email sent to shareholders earlier this year.\n\nAllegations included the failure to disclose that the \"US-China trade war had negatively impacted demand for iPhones and Apple's pricing power in greater China\".\n\nThe litigation also claimed that Apple had not informed investors of the impact of reducing the cost of replacement batteries to \"make up for the company's prior conduct of intentionally degrading the performance of the batteries in older iPhones\". It said Apple then failed to tell investors at the time that the resulting rate at which customers were replacing batteries in their older iPhones, rather than purchasing new models was \"negatively impacting\" sales growth.\n\nRead more: The top stock sectors to watch for the rest of 2024\n\nIt was also claimed that Apple failed to inform investors that it had \"slashed production orders\" from suppliers for the 2018 iPhone models and \"cut prices to reduce inventory\" as a result of slowing demand.\n\nThe lawsuit said that Apple's \"decision to withhold unit sales for iPhones and other hardware, which was a metric relevant to investors and their view of the company's financial performance, was designed to and would mask declines in unit sales of the company's flagship product\".\n\nThe shareholder lawsuit stemmed from Apple's warning on 2 January 2019 that its quarterly revenue would be $9bn lower than forecast, citing US-China trade tensions. This marked the first time Apple had cut revenue guidance since 2007, when the iPhone was released.\n\nThis update came after Apple CEO Tim Cook had told investors on a fourth-quarter results call on 1 November 2018 that while the business faced pressure in certain markets, he \"would not put China in that category\".\n\nWho can claim compensation\n\nThe lead plaintiff on the case was Norfolk County Council, as it said its pension fund was impacted by Apple's alleged actions.\n\nApple reached a settlement on the lawsuit in March, agreeing to pay out $490m (£369m), part of which will go to Norfolk council.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spokesperson for the Norfolk pension fund said they were \"proud of this recovery for investors\".\n\nShawn Williams, a partner Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP which represented investors, said the settlement was an \"outstanding result\".\n\nWhen is the deadline?\n\nAn email was sent to a group of shareholders in July saying they had until Friday 4 October 2024 to submit a claim for compensation. This covers investors who held shares in the company in those two months leading up to the revised revenue guidance.\n\nMore details of the litigation can be found via this link to the 2019 Apple Securities Settlement website. Those wishing to make claim need to do so using the form on this link and then submit it online or send to the address detailed on the form.\n\nRead more: Pound, gold and oil prices in focus: commodity and currency check\n\nIn a confirmation email in response to submitting the form, Apple said: \"Claims processing in settlements such as this can take an average of nine months to a year before distribution is approved, and in some instances there may be additional delays due to appeals or other issues.\"\n\nShares in Apple, the world's most valuable company, have faced pressure more recently amid concerns of softer demand for its latest iPhone 16 model. The shares fell 3% in Tuesday's session, after Barclays' research observed indicators of weaker demand for the phone, which was launched last month.\n\nHowever, year-to-date the stock is still up 17%, with a market capitalisation of $3.43tn.\n\nA spokesperson for Apple had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nOne year into the top job at payments giant PayPal (PYPL), Alex Chriss is emerging from a period of heads-down rebuilding with two simple messages to investors.\n\nPayPal's next decade won't solely be focused on payments, and the 26-year-old tech firm will move with more laser-like precision to bring that vision to life.\n\n\"When I got here it was obviously a great team and an incredible company with incredible opportunity ahead. But to be honest, it was just moving too slowly.\" Chriss, 47, told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\n\"And the world that we play in — this fintech world — is so dynamic, so interesting with so much competition out there that if you're not moving quickly, if you're not innovating fast, then you're just going to get left behind,\" he said.\n\nThe first-time CEO honed his craft during a 19-year run at TurboTax parent Intuit (INTU), where he oversaw its lucrative small business segment. He played a key role in Intuit's $12 billion acquisition of MailChimp in 2021, its largest deal ever made.\n\nSince joining PayPal, Chriss has overhauled the entire leadership team, bringing in outsiders such as former General Electric (GE) CFO Jamie Miller. Once the fresh C-suite was rounded out, he cut projects to focus the team on bigger bets and moving quickly.\n\nIn the process, he is trying to find more cost savings to reinvest in new areas and improve profits.\n\n\"This has been one of the big things for me, shifting the company and the mindset from just being a payments company to really working across commerce,\" Chriss said. \"We have hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of millions of merchants, and we are the one company that can connect the dots between the two of them.\" New PayPal CEO Alex Chriss (on TV monitors) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi about the company's coming transformation. (Jennifer Wang, Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe mindset shift has begun to materialize in a series of commerce partnerships.\n\nShoppers using Amazon’s Buy with Prime feature can now pay via PayPal. The company will become an additional online credit and debit card processor for Shopify Payments.\n\nIt also said it would enable US merchants to invest in crypto directly from their PayPal business account. The company has started running TV ads with comedian Will Ferrell that highlight more ways to use PayPal and changed its iconic logo to a black font from its longtime blue.\n\n“Under Alex’s leadership, PayPal has made remarkable progress doubling down on its core mission and innovation roadmap,” Enrique Lores, CEO of HP Inc. (HPQ) and PayPal's new chairman, told me.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Alex’s strong product and technology experience combined with his commitment to the customer has resulted in significant gains for the company. It is a privilege to serve as board chair at such an exciting time for PayPal.”\n\nInvestors in wait-and-see mode Alex Chriss quote\n\nPayPal has been on a wild ride since breaking off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015.\n\nExpanding its reach beyond store payments to crypto and payment sharing (via Venmo) was the focus of former longtime CEO Dan Schulman.\n\nRead more: Is it safe to store money in apps like Venmo, PayPal, and Cash App?\n\nIts market cap surged from $50 billion around its 2015 Nasdaq debut to more than $362 billion in the summer of 2021.\n\nBut cracks started to emerge in its investment thesis later that year. By the summer of 2022, the firm was attacked by famed activist investor Elliott Management, who demanded cost cuts to offset pressures on the top line and boost its sagging stock price.\n\nThe weak stock price and profits came amid rising competition from newer entrants such as Robinhood (HOOD), Affirm (AFRM), and Coinbase (COIN), and improved execution at legacy payment brands American Express (AXP), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA).\n\nApple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) have also made strong inroads with payment offerings of their own.\n\nPayPal went on to outline $900 million in cost cuts to appease Elliott — mostly through layoffs, real estate consolidation, and project cutbacks. It also uncorked a $15 billion stock buyback plan.\n\nThen, Schulman and the board got to work on picking his successor. By December 2023, Schulman left PayPal's board, with the ship firmly in Chriss's hands.\n\nDespite second quarter sales and operating income rising 8% and 17%, respectively, PayPal's market cap is a fraction of its peak at $79.2 billion. The stock trades on a relatively low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 16 times as investors wait for sustainable, stronger results. Shares are down 23% in the past five years.\n\nBy comparison, Visa, Mastercard, and American Express shares trade on an average forward P/E of 25 times. Coinbase's forward P/E ratio stands at 45 times.\n\n\"Penetration rates for both eCommerce and digital wallets to grind higher over time, which we believe PayPal will be a clear beneficiary of. Until there is greater visibility around the medium-term growth profile for transaction margin dollars and net take rate trajectory, we see limited potential for multiple expansion,\" Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams wrote in a client note.\n\nWilliams rates PayPal's stock at a Hold.\n\nChriss says he is up to the challenge of reinventing PayPal with an eye on better outcomes for shareholders.\n\n\"We've got lots of competitors that focus on consumers, lots of competitors that focus on merchants, but very few, if any, that can actually bring the two together. And so we're being hyper-focused on where we're going to win,\" Chriss added.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?",
        "content": "Cupertino-based tech giant Apple has been on a superb six-month surge, rebounding sharply from its April lows with impressive momentum. Since April, it has been a sea of green for Apple investors, pocketing more than 30% in gains over the past six months. Moreover, with the iPhone upgrade super cycle underway and despite the concerns, the iPhone 16 is proving to be a strong seller, with analysts optimistic about Apple stock's performance. However, after its powerful surge in value, the stock trades at a sizeable premium, outpacing its historical benchmarks and peers. Nonetheless, with the upcoming Apple intelligence rollout for the iPhone 16 and strong October-November seasonality, I expect the stock to continue moving higher despite the risks.\n\niPhone 16 Rollout Off to a Strong Start\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SHOP.\n\nApple has been building a healthy head of steam leading up to the recent iPhone 16 launch, fueled by bullish calls from analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives. Ives touted an upgrade supercycle driven by the release of AI-powered features for the company's flagship iPhone device earlier this year. Following the highly anticipated OpenAI partnership revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, Ives called it a home run.\n\nMoreover, he talked about the pervasive impact of the AI-driven super cycle that'll likely extend beyond iPhones and into their services. Ives felt Apple didn't receive enough credit for its AI monetization, a scenario likely to change with 1.5 billion iPhones primed to upgrade.\n\nRoughly three months have passed since the WWDC event, and the iPhone 16 is in stores, boasting an impressive opening weekend. Ives wrote in a recent investor note that iPhone 16 sales are likely to rise by high single digits, potentially reaching double digits by the fourth-quarter. Moreover, he added that the iPhone 16's AI features, camera upgrades, and improved battery life could drive its upgrade cycle to exceed 90 million units at launch, ahead of its predecessor, the iPhone 15, by 8 million to 10 million units. Following the encouraging launch numbers, Ives maintains his Outperform rating on the stock, assigning a $300 price target.\n\nSimilarly, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee reaffirmed his bullish buy rating on Apple stock, boosting his price target to $245 from $225. Chatterjee expects Apple to sell 244 million iPhones next year, representing a solid 10% jump from the 222 million expected this year. Additionally, he forecasts sales to climb to a massive 268 million by 2026. Additionally, he's raising estimates for services growth, which will be driven by stronger monetization through third-party AI applications in the coming years.\n\nStory continues iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nAuthors own based on historical data\n\nThe chart above shows the global trajectory of iPhone sales from 2007 to 2023, highlighting their growth and steady performance over the years. Since 2015, iPhone sales growth has been relatively flat, with considerable drops in 2018 and 2019. However, growth has picked up remarkably since 2021, and based on Chatterjee's estimates, we could see 5% to 10% growth in the upcoming years, with robust upside expected from the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\n\nProfitability and Financial Resilience Remain Strong\n\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst for iPhone stock over the years has been the strength of its bottom line and its stand-out liquidity metrics. Therefore, despite the relatively uninspiring iPhone sales, the stock has returned more than 54% in the past three years, beating the S&P 500's 28% gain. Its diversified services and hardware ecosystem and effective cost management continue to fuel its robust earnings. iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nGurufocus rates Apple's profitability rates at a perfect 10/10, showcasing its dominance in financial strength compared to its peers and historical metrics. The company's gross margin of almost 46% is comfortably ahead of industry averages, reflecting its superior cost management and premium pricing power. A major driver behind Apple's success has been a shift towards services, accounting for 22.2% of total sales. Additionally, this segment surged from $3.69 billion in Q1 2013 to a remarkable $24.2 billion in Q3 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the company's operating margin at 31.27% and net margin at 26.44% are equally impressive, highlighting its efficiency in managing its operational expenses. Also, its return on equity (ROE) is at a superb 151.08%, shedding light on its exceptional efficiency in using equity to generate profits. Additionally, Apple's ROIC-WACC% has soared, climbing from 15% in 2020 to an impressive 22% in 2023, indicative of the company's growing ability to generate returns over its cost of capital. iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nNaturally, we see that trickle-down effect on its financial strength rating, which attracts an impressive 7 on 10 rating. Perhaps the standout metric for Apple is its exceptional interest coverage ratio of around 120.35 times, showing its powerful ability to meet its interest obligations. Likewise, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.75 aligns with its historical benchmarks and peers, reflecting the effective management of its debt load relative to earnings. On top of that, with a Piotroski F-Score of 8/9 and an Altman Z-Score of 10.13, Apple is deemed financially safe, signaling low distress levels.\n\nA Deep Dive into Apple's Valuation Dynamics\n\nAs I mentioned, Apple's stock has been on a superb run in the past six months after bottoming out in April. The stock has continued to notch higher highs and is currently trading close to its 52-week high price of $237.23. It has been linked to the enthusiasm surrounding its Apple Intelligence, which will likely be a pivotal talking point over the next several months. However, so far, given the relatively strong opening sales for the iPhone 16, without the AI features in place, investors are licking their lips over what's to come. Depending on where it may go from here, the stock has found support around $196.72 and is unlikely to move below that level in the near-term. Moreover, it has seen strong resistance around the $238 mark, close to its 52-week highs. iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nApple Stock Seasonality (Courtesy TrendSpider)\n\nAnother advantage for Apple stock is that October and November historically show strong seasonality, with October standing out, as shown by the chart above. We can see that October tends to be the third-strongest month in terms of seasonality for the tech giant, with July being the strongest.\n\nFurthermore, Apple's 12-month price target of $240.58 represents almost a 6% upside from current price levels. The high estimate of $300 aligns with Dan Ives's price target, pointing to a superb bullish sentiment, while the low-end projection of $183.90 points to a conservative outlook. Notably, the GF Value of around the $200 mark points to a reversion back to its critical support level, implying that though the stock is considerably overvalued. iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nThe bearish picture painted by Apple's GF value is supported by its unattractive pricing metrics at this time. Apple's current price of around $227.40 comfortably exceeds multiple valuation metrics, underscoring its overbought status. Discounted cash flow (DCF) models based on free cash flow and earnings suggest fair values of $154.88 and $174.53, reflecting sizeable gaps of 32% and 23%, respectively. Other metrics, including the Peter Lynch value of $113.99, show an even greater disparity, reinforcing the overvaluation narrative. iPhone 16 Surge vs. Valuation Woes: Can Apple Maintain Its Bullish Run?\n\nThe chart mirrors 2021 when Apple (AAPL, Financial) saw a healthy bump in iPhone sales driven by the iPhone 12's 5G debut, similar to the current momentum sparked by the iPhone 16's new AI features. However, as you can see from the 2021 chart below, while Apple's stock price is fair value estimates, it still maintained closer alignment with fundamentals compared to 2024. In fact, in 2021, Apple's DCF based on free cash flows was at a solid $149.38, comfortably above its stock price of $132.69, signaling better alignment with its intrinsic value.\n\nRisks To The Thesis\n\nA huge part of Apple's stock's bull case is linked to Apple Intelligence, but multiple risks will likely impact its price. Firstly, AI features central to the iPhone 16's appeal are still in their nascency and will roll out over time, with its most advanced features unlikely to be fully operational until months after launch.\n\nAdditionally, while commendable, Apple's commitment to privacy could significantly hamper its ability to compete with more aggressive AI development that's taking place at Google and OpenAI. This will likely impact Apple's innovation curve, impacting its long-term bull case. Furthermore, the overvaluation narrative persists with Apple stock, which trades at a premium and already reflects much of the AI-fueled growth potential, as discussed extensively.\n\nBottomline On Apple Stock\n\nApple stock has been running hot, fueled by the excitement surrounding its highly touted AI-powered features, likely to propel its business into its next phase of expansion. Moreover, iPhone 16 sales are off to a strong start, even without the AI features, pointing to more upside ahead. Additionally, historically, the stock tends to perform well in the next couple of months, adding to its bull case. However, investors should be cautious of the risks, especially if the full potential of Apple Intelligence isn't realized.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Apple with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nApple's Earnings Per Share Are Growing\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. We can see that in the last three years Apple grew its EPS by 9.1% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. This approach makes Apple look pretty good, on balance; although revenue is flattish, EBIT margins improved from 29% to 31% in the last year. Which is a great look for the company.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Apple's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Apple Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$3.5t company like Apple. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$2.2b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.06% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add Apple To Your Watchlist?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Apple is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Apple , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nAlthough Apple certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "42.4% of Warren Buffett's $315.4 Billion Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is Invested in These 2 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Under the leadership of its legendary chief executive officer, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway has become one of history's most successful companies and delivered stellar returns for long-term shareholders. With a market capitalization of roughly $990 billion, Berkshire stands as one of the biggest companies in the S&P 500 and the eighth-largest company in the world.\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, Buffett and his advisors have built the company's stock portfolio around companies that do -- and the Oracle of Omaha's portfolio composition has helped his company crush the broader market.\n\nRead on for a look at the two dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks that account for 42.4% of Berkshire's $315.4 billion stock portfolio.\n\nThis tech giant is still Buffett's biggest bet\n\nKeith Noonan: Even after selling nearly half of its Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) position last quarter, Berkshire still owns 400 million shares of the tech giant's stock. Apple continues to be the largest position in Berkshire's portfolio and accounts for roughly 29.4% of the company's total stock holdings. With a market cap of just over $3.5 trillion, Apple also stands as the biggest component in the S&P 500 and the world's largest company.\n\nApple's dividend yield of 0.4% may not look like much right now. On the other hand, it's still a substantial income generator for Berkshire. With its quarterly dividend sitting at $0.25 per share, Apple is on track to deliver $400 million in dividend income for Buffett's company during the next year even if the tech giant does not raise its payout. Although Apple has only raised its payout by roughly 30% during the past five years, the company has increased its payout on an annual basis for 13 years running -- so there's a good chance that the company will deliver another payout increase next year and beyond.\n\nCrucially for a dividend-paying company, Apple's business is a cash-generating machine. Thanks in large part to its incredibly successful mobile hardware business, the company has also frequently ranked as the world's most profitable business during the past decade.\n\nWhile most players in the mobile market have been hit by commodification trends that have pushed down prices and crushed margins, Apple's brand strength and loyal customer base have helped the company continue to record fantastic profitability with its iPhone hardware. In the second quarter, iPhone lines accounted for roughly 45% of total worldwide revenue in the smartphone market. Even more impressive, Apple accounted for roughly 85% of total global operating income in the category.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has a dominant position in the mobile hardware industry, and its software and services, wearables, and computers operations also generate substantial amounts of cash. With a strong core of businesses and untapped growth opportunities still ahead, Apple will likely be a significant passive income generator for Berkshire and Buffett for many years to come.\n\nOne of Buffett's longtime favorites\n\nJennifer Saibil: American Express(NYSE: AXP) is one of Buffett's longest-held stocks, and he has lauded it for its global brand and dividend. It slid into the No. 2 spot as Buffett's largest holdings after he sold some of his position in Bank of America earlier this year, and it accounts for 13% of the total portfolio.\n\nThe company is known for its elite credit cards, but it has a full financial services platform with merchant and consumer sides. It operates a closed-loop system, which means it funds its own credit cards instead of relying on partnerships with banks, and it charges annual fees for most of its credit cards. The closed-loop system keeps it flush with cash, and the membership model results in customer loyalty and profitability; card membership fees go straight to the bottom line.\n\nBecause it's a bank with savings accounts and deposits, American Express generates net interest income in addition to profit from running its card business. Although it's had to increase its provisions for losses to account for defaults in the high-interest rate environment, it has increased net interest income significantly -- 20% year over year in the second quarter. Net income increased 39% year over year.\n\nIts proprietary cards are resonating with a younger group of affluent customers who like its perks and awards, in addition to its classic core customer, and card fees increased 16% year over year in the second quarter (currency neutral). Since the high-inflation, high-interest rate environment started in 2021, American Express' revenue has increased by almost 50%, cardmember spending is up nearly 40%, and it's added 23 million new cards. It's also accepted by 30 million more merchants, leading to strong network effects.\n\nStrong cash generation and profitability make the dividend a no-brainer. American Express has paid a dividend since 1989, and it's grown 169% during the past 10 years. It yields 1% at the current price, lower than average, because the stock price is rising. It's up 43% year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 gain of 20%.\n\nBuffett noted in a recent shareholder letter that Berkshire Hathaway completed its purchase of American Express stock in 1995 for a total cost of about $1.3 billion. Its annual dividends from American Express stock increased from $41 million at the outset to $302 million in 2022, and he's fully confident in that amount continuing to rise.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 774% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 169% for the S&P 500.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of September 30, 2024\n\nAmerican Express is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "content": "Nike (NKE)\n\nShares in Nike slid 5% in after hours trading on Tuesday, on the back of the sportswear brand reporting fiscal first-quarter revenues that missed estimates.\n\nNike posted revenues of $11.59bn (£8.72bn), which fell short of analyst estimates of $11.65bn and was also 10% lower compared to the same period last year.\n\nWhile the company reported first-quarter earnings per share of $0.70, which beat Wall Street estimates of $0.52, this was still 26% lower than last year.\n\nNike also withdrew its full-year guidance and said it was postponing its investor day, amid the transition of CEO, as Elliot Hill is set to replace John Donahoe on 14 October.\n\n\"A comeback at this scale takes time, and while there are some early wins, we have yet to turn the corner,\" Nike CFO Matthew Friend said on the company's earnings call Tuesday night.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets follow oil higher as traders await Israeli response to Iran missile attacks\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “Nike is now paying the price for taking its eyes off the ball.

The Hang Seng (^HSI) index ended Wednesday's session 6% higher, though mainland Chinese markets are closed for the weeklong national holiday.\n\nOther stocks on the Hong Kong market that also continued to ride the stimulus-fuelled wave of investor enthusiasm, included JD.com (9618.HK) and Tencent (0700.HK), which gained 11% and 6% respectively.\n\nA report by trading analytics company S3 Partners, published Tuesday, found that short sellers had lost $6.9bn mark-to-market as China's CSI 300 (000300.SS) index rallied on the back of the stimulus announcement.\n\nJD Sports Fashion (JD.L)\n\nAnother sportswear retailer in focus was UK firm JD Sports, which reported a sharp fall in profits in the first-half of its fiscal year.\n\nProfits before tax came in at £126m for the six months to 3 August, which represented a 64% drop from the nearly £354m the company reported for the same period last year.\n\nThe group, which also owns outdoor brands Millets and Blacks, posted revenues of £5bn for the period, up from nearly £4.8bn last year.\n\nThe company said revenues for JD in the UK were down 4.6% in the first half to £1.2bn, \"driven by the disposal of non-strategic brands over the previous 12 months\". It said like-for-like and organic sales on adjusted basis were down, with these declines reflecting a \"challenging, and often volatile, UK market\".\n\nRead more: The top stock sectors to watch for the rest of 2024\n\n\"The earlier Easter falling at the end of March in the current year, combined with unfavourable spring and early summer weather conditions, dampened footfall and full price demand for seasonal apparel lines resulting in a more promotional environment thereafter,\" the company said.\n\nShares were down 5% on Tuesday morning following the release of the results and have fallen 14% year-to-date.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said that the shares are \"still looking extremely cheap on a historical valuation basis, and with the group increasingly laying out plans to build on its growing global footprint, the market consensus of the shares as a buy is an indication that JD Sports has much further to run.\"\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other widely held stocks.\n\nTwo 25 Point Cuts May be the Most Likely Outcome\n\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D’Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\n\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\n\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\n\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\n\nThe Market is Broadening\n\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\n\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\n\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. The launch of iPhone 16 and iOS 18 is expected to drive strong financial results for the company for the rest of 2024.\n\nIn FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple’s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 10% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion.\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Global stock markets are now entering what is set to be an eventful fourth quarter, with the US election and more interest rate decisions looming.\n\nMarkets continued to rally to round off a strong end to the third quarter, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closing at a new record high on Monday.\n\nHowever, US stocks fell on Tuesday, as investors digested the latest jobs and manufacturing data, as well as comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who said policymakers aren't in a hurry to lower rates.\n\nThis tempered traders' bets of another 0.5% interest rate cut, after the Fed recently announced its first rate reduction in four years, lowering its range by a bigger-than-expected 50 basis points.\n\nRead more: UK GDP grows less than first thought over spring\n\nThe European Central Bank also made its second 25 basis-point rate cut of the year in September. And while the Bank of England kept rates on hold at its latest meeting, it had already announced a rate reduction in August, with markets betting on a next cut in November.\n\nKeeping an eye on central bank policy decisions and monitoring how effectively rate setters can navigate a \"soft-landing\" for the economy, as more jobs and inflation data are released, is one focus for asset managers and market strategists in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the major market event on their minds is the US presidential election on 5 November. With the outcome of this still unclear, the theory is that many investors decide to \"move to the sidelines\" in the run-up to that date and await more clarity.\n\n'Significant turnaround' in markets\n\nHenry Allen, macro strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note released on Monday that this recent rally marked \"a significant turnaround from earlier in Q3, when there was major turmoil as US recession fears grew\".\n\nOne of the factors behind this shift, he explained, was the pivot in central bank policy.\n\nIn addition to this policy pivot, Allen said the fact that US economic data had started to improve again, had also bolstered market sentiment. For instance, the four-week average of initial jobless claims was now down to its lowest point since May and non-farm payrolls were up by 142,000 in August.\n\nHe added that the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow estimate, which acts a model for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, is now up to 3.1% from 2.9% for the the third quarter, while other \"indicators like retail sales and industrial production have also pointed away from a recession\".\n\nWhat's more, last week's stimulus announcements by China's central bank led to \"phenomenal performance among Chinese equities, along with China- exposed stocks more broadly\".\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nIn fact, the Shanghai Composite (000001.SS) index closed Monday's session in China 8% higher, which was its largest daily increase since 2008.\n\nIn the UK, while the FTSE 100's (^FTSE) gains have been smaller year-to-date, up nearly 7%, it still reached an all-time high of 8,445.8 in May and stood at 8,273 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"Given how strong things have been for markets recently, there's understandably been some scepticism as to whether this can continue,\" said Allen.\n\nHowever, he added that there are \"still clear signs that investors are pricing in a higher-than-usual chance of more negative outcomes like a recession\" in the US.\n\nIf economic growth does hold up and the Fed manages to ease into a soft landing, Allen said that the \"historical precedents from here are very positive for markets\".\n\nFourth-quarter investment outlook\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"I guess the summary for Q4 – there are a number of big unknowns, all with big implications for the outlook for 2025.\"\n\nHe said that the result of the US election is still as unclear as it was at the beginning of year and \"all potential outcomes are still on the table\".\n\nGimber, therefore, said the \"focus should absolutely be on ensuring that investors are avoiding being overly exposed to any one particular outcome\".\n\nHe said that a second key topic for the fourth quarter is \"how much an acceleration in the weakening of the [economic] data do we see\".\n\nAnother topic Gimber said he is focused on in the fourth quarter is a \"broadening out of earnings\".\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nHe expected to see earnings growth in the mid-teens in both the 'Magnificent Seven' group of technology giants, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), and the rest of the S&P 500.\n\n\"You compare that to Q1 of this year, where the Magnificent Seven were growing earnings by 50% and the rest of the market was in negative growth territory,\" Gimber explained.\n\nEven so, Gimber said artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to be a big driver for markets, but is more focused on some of those \"left behind sectors that stand to benefit from almost a second round effect from AI effectively\".\n\n\"There's a fundamental disconnect today being priced as if they're going to completely revolutionise the economy and then everything else,\" he said. \"That gap has to close one way or another.\"\n\nGimber said that the utilities sector was one example of a \"clear AI beneficiary\" with the increase in electricity demand that going to come from data centres. The healthcare sector was another example of an area he is focused on.\n\nRead more: European Central Bank forecast to cut interest rates to 2.5% in 2025\n\nGoing into the fourth quarter, he said that it's key to ensure portfolios are positioned to be \"resilient to the multiple potential outcomes that can stem from the US election\".\n\nHe explained that inflation risks have faded and central banks stand ready to cut rates in the event of a shock to economic growth and in that scenario \"multi-asset investors have many more tools available to build a well-diversified portfolio, mixing risk assets with high-quality government bonds than they did in 2023 or 2022 when inflation levels were still higher\".\n\n\"This is a good opportunity to be rebalancing portfolios away from the previous winners and tilting into sectors that have been left behind, particularly those with a more defensive tilt – utilities and healthcare being two examples,\" he added.\n\nUS election outlook\n\nAjay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research at Barclays (BARC.L), said in a fourth-quarter outlook note in September that the US election would have \"far-reaching consequences\" for the world, explaining that a second presidency for Donald Trump would \"likely see a new global trade war\".\n\nThe former president and Republican candidate has proposed blanket tariffs of 10% on all US imports and tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods.\n\n\"Other countries would retaliate, with uncertain but serious effects on economies and markets,\" said Rajadhyaksha.\n\nIf Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is elected, he said that a \"gridlock is more likely ... with far less dramatic policy changes\".\n\n\"But the presidential race is so close, and US politics so partisan, that markets will keep guessing until 5 November,\" said Rajadhyaksha. \"The result could lead to starkly different winners and losers in global markets.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nGiven that \"policy paths post-5 November are so binary\", he said that \"many investors will probably move to the sidelines and wait for clarity\".\n\n\"Markets seem to lack conviction going into Q4, and frankly, so do we,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of how this translates into investments, Rajadhyaksha said Barclays' \"bias is to be overweight risk assets, short core fixed income, and own the trade-weighted USD (US dollar)\", which measures its value relative to other currencies.\n\n\"But we would not be surprised if all markets are range-bound in the coming weeks as they wait and watch economic and political developments in the US. For the rest of this year at least, as America goes, so goes the rest of the world,\" he added.\n\nWith regards to equities, Rajadhyaksha and his team said that in the US they maintained their positive outlook on the \"big tech\" sector and had upgraded their outlook on utilities stocks to positive.\n\nPost-election impact\n\nMeanwhile, Themis Themistocleous, head of the UBS (UBSG.SW) EMEA investment office, said to journalists at a recent outlook event that he would expect the \"outcome of the [US] elections is more likely to be felt at a sector level rather than the overall level of the equity market\".\n\nHe said there would be more defence spending irrespective of who becomes president.\n\nHowever, he added: \"I suspect if Trump becomes the next president then the level of noise is going to go up even more and as a result, maybe decisions need to be taken even faster than otherwise. So in some ways I would suspect the defence sector to benefit overall, but obviously a Trump win most probably will accelerate that appreciation.\"\n\nIf Harris wins, on the other hand, Themistocleous believed there would more likely be a continuation of current trends, such as support on the energy transition.\n\nRead more: Top fund picks for self-invested pensions\n\n\"And of course, as we know, a lot of European companies have leading positions in some of these technologies like in green tech, so [there would be] continued support there,\" he said.\n\nIn this scenario, Themistocleous said there were a number of industrial and utilities companies that could benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, he highlighted luxury as a sector that could be impacted in different ways if Trump becomes president.\n\n\"If we have tax cuts in the US that would support the upper consumer segment in the US which buy those things so that could be positive,\" he said, but added that any significant impacts on China could also but pressure on the sector.\n\nFor those investors that might be looking at how to ride through any volatility from the outcome of the election, Themistocleous highlighted consumer staples and utilities as examples of defensive sectors.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that this was very much a six-month to one-year view. Longer-term, Themistocleous also favoured AI as an investment theme with \"multi-year development\".\n\nIn fact, the overriding message going into the fourth quarter seemed to be that, regardless of any short-term volatility on the horizon, investors should continue looking for those companies that facilitate and benefit from structural changes in the economy.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

Apple is also aiming to manufacture new iPad Air models and keyboards for release around the same time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public.\n\nThe release will mark the first update to the iPhone SE since 2022, when Apple added 5G capability to the device. With the latest model, Apple will move away from the old home button design and transition to an edge-to-edge screen.\n\nThe SE overhaul will help Apple compete in the low-end smartphone market, where it faces tough competition from Android devices — especially in China. The current model costs $429, which is hundreds less than the standard iPhone but more expensive than many of its rivals. Modernizing the SE so it looks more like its higher-end siblings should help entice budget-minded shoppers and potentially win back market share lost to brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nThe new SE phone is expected to support Apple Intelligence, an upcoming suite of AI tools that will also work with the iPhone 16 and the high-end versions of last year’s iPhone 15. The new model will resemble the iPhone 14, including the notch cutout at the top. The current SE more closely resembles the iPhone 8, the last standard version to include a home button.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe new iPad Air models — codenamed J607 and J637 — will focus on internal improvements. Apple also is preparing an updated version of its Magic Keyboard accessory, codenamed R307 and R308, for both the 11-inch and 13-inch versions of the new Air. These will bring some of the features of the iPad Pro keyboard down-market.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple updated the Air lineup with an M2 chip and added the 13-inch screen option. A new iPad mini — codenamed J410 — is coming too, potentially by the end of 2024.\n\nA revamped version of the iPad Pro was released at the same time as this year’s iPad Air, but that higher-end device includes an M4 processor that has yet to come to other models. That means an update is less urgent given the chip is already a generation ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond the new iPhone SE and iPads, Apple is also refreshing its Mac computer lineup. Updated models this year will include a revamped Mac mini as well as updated MacBook Pros and iMacs. They’ll sport the M4 processor and highlight Apple Intelligence features. The M4 chip will come to the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro during 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Investors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought Military Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US The Presidential Election Isn’t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Image: Sean Gallup (Getty Images)\n\nTech giant Apple (AAPL) has been accused of fostering an illegal work environment and violating multiple efforts organized by employees to advocate for better wages and workplace conditions, according to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed on Monday by the labor board, Apple forced employees across the country to sign “illegal” non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements, according to Reuters.\n\nThe complaint further accuses the tech giant of “interfering” and “restraining” employees’ rights under federal labor law.\n\nApple says it has “always” respected its employees’ rights to discuss wages, hours, and working conditions and has “strongly” disagreed with the accusations that have been made in the complaint, a company spokesperson said to Reuters.\n\nIf the case is not settled by Apple, it will be moved on to an administrative judge beginning in January. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board wants Apple to repeal its reported workplace violations and alert the public of their legal rights.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the company has been accused of infringing on its workers. In January 2023, the National Labor Relations Board stated that Apple had imposed acts on its employees that stopped them from discussing their earnings and engaging in other protected activities, per CNN.\n\nAdditionally, in June, two former female employees at Apple filed a class action lawsuit against the company for gender discrimination. The women accused the company of paying women employees significantly less than male employees for the same work, which was also reported by CNN.\n\nApple is currently facing two other pending lawsuits from the National Labor Relations Board, which claims the company terminated an employee at its California-based headquarters for allegedly criticizing managers and illegally interfering with a union campaign at a retail store in Atlanta, per Reuters.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Epic Games Starts A New Battle With Google And Samsung",
        "content": "Epic Games Starts A New Battle With Google And Samsung\n\nThe video game maker Epic Games kicked off the week with a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google and Samsung, accusing them of conspiring to block third party competition on Samsung devices. This is Epic’s second lawsuit against Google.\n\nMore precisely, Epic Games accused Samsung and Google of violating antitrust laws in application distribution on Samsung devices. With Samsung’s “Auto Blocker” feature that is turned on by default, Epic Games accused the two for only allowing for apps from authorized sources, such as the Samsung Galaxy Store or Google Play Store, to be installed. This feature can be changed in a phone’s settings, but Samsung argues that it is a tool for blocking malicious activity as it prevents installation of applications from unauthorized sources.\n\nEpic claims that the Auto Blocker violates the December’s jury verdict.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Epic Games decided to file the lawsuit in order to prevent Google from “negating the long overdue promise of competition in the Android App Distribution Market,”. Last year, Epic won its first antitrust lawsuit against Google as the jury also found that Google protected its Android app store with competitive barriers that harmed both smartphone consumers and software developers. Epic now claims that Samsung designed the “Auto Blocker” feature in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the jury’s verdict from December.\n\nFour years after Epic went after the mighty Google for running an illegal app store monopoly, a battle which it won in December, Epic is suing again. Like in the previous lawsuit, Epic insists it is fighting on behalf of all developers, not just for its personal interest. Samsung made it clear it will vigorously contest Epic Games’ baseless claim, while a spokesperson from Google, Dan Jackson, described the lawsuit as being meritless, with Google denying collusion. Epic Games does not have evidence that Google and Samsung colluded on the Auto Blocker feature that it claims has cemented Google’s dominance, its hopes that evidence of anticompetitive behavior would surface during the document discovery process. Like last time, Epic is asking for a jury trial. In addition, Epic has another ongoing legal battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple was due to submit approximately 1.3 million documents related to recent App Store changes on Monday. The ongoing dispute is result of Epic Games‘ deliberate violation of App Store rules back in 2020, which caused Apple to remove it from the platform. While this battle continues, Apple was forced to update its AppStore rules in Europe, now allowing other payment methods. Therefore, whatever happens, titans like Apple and Google are facing an evolving landscape, with outcome of these disputes and regulatory action threatening to significantly weaken their dominance, possibly setting new precedents in their ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Why Apple (AAPL) Stock Is Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 3.6% in the morning session as the major indices declined (Nasdaq down 1.8%, S&P 500 down 0.9%) amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. NBC News reported (citing White House and Defense Department officials) that the U.S. \"has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.\"\n\nSeparately, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told investors there is no \"preset course\" regarding the pace of future rate cuts. He added in a speech delivered to the National Association for Business Economics, \"Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course.\" While the markets could still be right about more rate cuts in the near term, Powell's comments added uncertainty to both the cadence and magnitude of cuts.\n\nFollowing these updates, the VIX index (or fear gauge) spiked as the reports created more uncertainty, which investors certainly don't like.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApple’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 2 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nApple is up 21.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $224.76 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $234.82 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,003.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a great stock to own since late September 2019. During that five-year stretch, its shares produced a 328% total return. This gain absolutely trounces the broader S&P 500.\n\nThe momentum has continued this year, as Apple is up 18% (as of Sept. 27). But investors care about what the future holds. Where will this consumer discretionary stock be in five years?\n\nApple's underlying business\n\nApple's business model has shifted in the past several years. To be more specific, services have become a bigger contributor to financial success. Offerings like iCloud, Pay, TV+, and the App Store, among others, are a growth engine, posting 14% sales growth in the latest fiscal quarter (Q3 2024, ended June 29).\n\nEven better, services boast a stellar gross margin of 74%. And they provide a recurring and predictable revenue stream for Apple, which is exactly what shareholders want.\n\nHowever, this remains a hardware company at its core. Sales of physical products represented 72% of overall revenue in Q3. These hardware devices are still key to Apple's success. The iPhone in particular accounted for 46% of Apple's sales last quarter.\n\nAlthough services are becoming more important, I think five years from now, products, especially the iPhone, will still be the main aspect of the company's financial performance. Consequently, the business will most likely look very similar to how it does today.\n\nBut artificial intelligence (AI) is set to feature more prominently. Apple just released its 16th lineup of iPhones. And these newer devices will be compatible with Apple Intelligence, the company's new AI-powered software that can help users summarize text, boost their writing skills, and edit photos. The hope is that AI can spur greater demand for new iPhone sales, but this hasn't been the case so far.\n\nNot the best setup for investors\n\nApple might have been a wildly successful investment in the past five years. But I don't believe this will be true over the next five.\n\nThe reason I think this way partly has to do with the valuation. If you want to buy Apple shares, you'll pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.7. On the one hand, it's easy to argue that such a dominant business deserves a high multiple. After all, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, is incredibly profitable, and is even a top holding for Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nHowever, that P/E ratio is 22% higher than the stock's trailing five-year average. Expectations have outgrown the underlying fundamentals. Paying a premium valuation would make sense only if investors believed that Apple was going to register outsize growth in the years ahead. It's hard to be optimistic in this regard, though.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompared to five or 10 years ago, Apple is now a very mature enterprise. There are more than 2.2 billion active devices scattered across the globe. While this figure inches higher each quarter, there are simply fewer opportunities to get these products into more hands, especially the iPhone. Revenue is slated to increase at just a 5.8% yearly rate between fiscal 2023 and 2026.\n\nAnd even though the iPhone is arguably the single most successful product of all time, newer updates aren't as revolutionary as they once were. This doesn't incentivize consumers to switch to the newest model, which can pressure revenue growth. When it comes to AI, the jury is still out on whether or not people even want or need these new features. It could all prove to be hype.\n\nThere's a very good chance that the stock could underperform the broader S&P 500 over the next five years. And that's why I don't own shares.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) is bringing major updates to its Copilot artificial intelligence platform for Windows, expanding the platform's capabilities with a number of new features and introducing the ability to speak directly to the AI helper.\n\nThe announcements, which the company made at a press event at its Microsoft Experience Center in New York on Tuesday, also included a context-aware Click to Do option that provides you with tools and actions to complete tasks related to what you see on your screen, a refreshed version of Windows Search, the ability to upscale your old photos to up to 8K resolution, and an AI-powered edit tool for erasing or adding objects to your images.\n\nThe company also said it's working on a feature called Copilot Vision, which is able to view your screen and understand questions you ask about what you're looking at.\n\nAll of these options come as Microsoft continues its AI push on both the consumer and enterprise sides of its business. The company launched its first wave of Copilot+ PCs in May, including its own Surface line of laptops and devices from partner companies including Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\n\nIn addition to its announcements on Tuesday, Microsoft also said it's preparing to roll out its previously delayed Recall feature for Windows 11. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of what you're doing on your computer, providing you with a kind of continuously updated visual library of the apps you've used and websites you've visited. Microsoft's new Click to Do option provides you with a context sensitive toolbox for taking actions related to what you're viewing on your screen. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nSecurity researchers, however, objected to the app saying hackers could exploit it to steal user information. Microsoft has since updated the offering, saying it's improved its overall security and made it an opt-in service.\n\nThe new Click to Do feature provides you with a context-aware set of options to complete tasks for what you're looking at on your screen. Press the Windows key, and then click the mouse, and you'll get a pop-up toolbox that will let you do things like remove or blur the background in a photo or perform a visual search using Bing. Microsoft says the feature will also work with text, helping you to rewrite or summarize what you've written.\n\nThe improved Windows Search feature now allows you to search for files and photos using descriptions of what they may include rather than their actual names. So, if you're looking for a file about an article you've written about new Microsoft features, you can search using something like \"new Microsoft updates\" and Search should pull up the right file.\n\nStory continues Microsoft's improved Windows Search will make it easier to find files and photos that you don't remember the name of by searching for them using natural language rather than file names and dates. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nMicrosoft's improved photo editing and image upscaling will help you take out unwanted objects from your photos, while Super resolution in Photos will improve the look of your older images, so you can grab those old shots you took on your first-generation iPhone and make them look like you shot them on the latest iPhone 16.\n\nThen there's Copilot Vision, which Microsoft says will only be available to a select set of Pro subscribers through Copilot Labs for now. During a pre-recorded demo, Microsoft showed how a user could speak to Copilot about shows they might want to watch while browsing the IMDB web page. The AI is able to look at the screen and make suggestions about what it sees, explaining to the user why they might enjoy certain TV shows or movies.\n\nMicrosoft says nothing is saved from your conversations with Copilot Vision after you end the session and the company won't train its AI using your chats.\n\nAll of these updates come ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. Adding new AI features just as PC sales are beginning to take off again should help drive consumers to Microsoft Copilot+ PCs. But Apple's (AAPL) own Apple Intelligence is also set to land on its Mac line of computers in the coming months, setting up an AI showdown for both company's laptop and desktop businesses.

        "title": "PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?",
        "content": "Over the past few years, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a popular choice for investors due to its high business quality and strong growth prospects. As one of the companies best positioned to benefit from the surge in e-commerce and peer-to-peer payments, PayPal's stock traded at elevated levels for several years, reflecting its perceived value as a high-growth business.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PYPL.\n\nHowever, despite the anticipated increase in competition, which put pressure on the company's take rate, PayPal's fortunes changed.\n\nFollowing the abrupt end of the hyper-bullish pandemic-driven scenario, the stock fell into a period of underperformance, becoming what many saw as a value trap.\n\nToday, the investment thesis for PayPal is different, centered on moderate growth and an attractive valuation relative to its return potential. In this article, I will explore the reasons behind the extended bearish sentiment on PayPal and how recent results suggest a gradual shift in investor outlook.\n\nWhy PayPal's Stock Took a Nosedive\n\nSince peaking in 2021, PayPal shares have experienced a staggering 75% decline. A few years ago, during the COVID-19 pandemic, PayPal positioned itself as a major beneficiary, with revenues rising by 20% and 18% between 2020 and 2021, while operating income grew by 22% and 25%, respectively. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nHowever, everything changed after July 2021, when PayPal shares began a significant sell-off. The company's revenue growth slowed, particularly as the e-commerce boom driven by the pandemic began to normalize. Throughout 2021, PayPal reported several earnings misses and lowered its forward guidance, raising investor concerns about headwinds such as increased competition and slowing consumer spending in digital payments.\n\nThe digital payments industry became highly competitive, with players like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Pay, and emerging fintech companies (such as Adyen (ADYEY) and Square (SQ)) gaining market share. This competitive pressure cast doubt on PayPal's ability to maintain its market dominance. In 2022, PayPal's revenues declined by 2%, and in 2023, it managed to grow by only 1%.\n\nAll of this occurred while PayPal was trading at inflated valuations, including a P/E ratio exceeding 90x, as illustrated in the graph below. It became evident that PayPal, once valued as a high-growth stock, no longer aligned with a bullish investment thesis. Consequently, a massive sell-off in PayPal shares ensued and continues to this day. However, circumstances may be changing now.\n\nStory continues PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nWhere Does PayPal Stand Today?\n\nInvestor confidence in PayPal has slowly been returning over the last twelve months. The company is currently trading at a market cap of $79.9 billion, with an enterprise value of $75.7 billion when accounting for cash, debt, and investments on the balance sheet.\n\nOver the past year, PayPal generated $31 billion in revenue, $4.4 billion in net income, and $6.7 billion in free cash flow. As a result, PayPal's stock is now valued at under 16x earnings and just 10.8x free cash flow. This level of valuation is typically associated with companies that are not experiencing growth; however, PayPal is indeed growing, albeit at a slower pace than during the pandemic.\n\nIn its most recent quarter reported in August (Q2), PayPal reported revenue growth of 8%. Additionally, the company's adjusted earnings per share, which now includes stock-based compensation, is projected to grow by 10% this year. At first glance, this suggests that PayPal stock is strongly undervalued. If earnings continue to grow at this rate, the payback period would be under nine years. However, several challenges must be considered.\n\nThe first challenge is that PayPal's recent growth has been supported by an aggressive cost-cutting strategy. Operating expenses fell by 10% last year and another 2% in the first half of this year. It is unlikely that PayPal can continue cutting costs significantly, meaning operating expenses will likely begin to rise, putting pressure on earnings once again.\n\nThe second challenge concerns the impact of interest rates. According to management, interest income accounted for about half of the transaction margin growth in the first half of the year. This growth is expected to decline sharply as the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, which will pose a headwind through 2025.\n\nHowever, perhaps the biggest challenge PayPal faces is the increasing competition in the payments industry. Transaction take rates are expected to weaken over time, raising uncertainty about PayPal's ability to outperform its competitors. For instance, Adyen reported a growth rate of 23% in the past twelve months, significantly higher than PayPal's 8%.\n\nNonetheless, sentiment around PayPal appears to be improving. When examining long-term moving averages, PayPal is trading well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating that the stock's long-term uptrend has been solid. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: YCharts\n\nIs PayPal a Deep Value Play or Just a Value Trap?\n\nExamining PayPal's trading chart over the last five years reveals that many investors who bought shares at the end of 2019, viewing the company as a deep value opportunity, ended up facing significant losses in subsequent years. But is PayPal still a value trap in the current scenario? In my opinion, it is not; quite the opposite.\n\nFirst, let's define what I consider to be \"value.\" A company that maintains a consistent track record of generally increasing earnings per share (EPS) without any negative earnings years meets my first criterion. In the last decade, PayPal's EPS has grown from $1.12 in 2016 to $4.13 in the last twelve months, with gradual increases in all but 2022, which was the company's worst performing year. Notably, it never approached a net loss. PayPal: Time to Dive Back in for Value?\n\nSource: StockRover\n\nThe second point worth discussing is PayPal's balance sheet. As a highly cash-generative business, PayPal's operationsdriven by strong transaction volumes and solid growth in digital paymentshave provided enough cash flow to fund its growth and strategic initiatives without relying heavily on borrowing. Until 2019, the company had virtually no debt. After that, PayPal began using debt to finance acquisitions and enhance its market position, such as its $4 billion acquisition of Honey in 2019. Over the last twelve months, PayPal reported long-term debt of $9.72 billion. However, this figure is manageable, especially when compared to its annual earnings; over the same period, PayPal reported a net income of $4.43 billion, meaning its indebtedness is below 2.5 times its earnings.\n\nTwo additional points that characterize PayPal as a deep value investment relate to profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC). Over the last decade, PayPal's ROE has remained above 14% between 2019 and 2023, except for 2022 when it dipped to 12%. Meanwhile, ROIC stayed above 10% for most of the last decade, peaking at 17% in 2020 and registering 15.5% in the trailing twelve months. Even during its challenging period in 2022, ROIC was a solid 8.5%. This consistency indicates that the company has generated returns substantially higher than its cost of capital, demonstrating the robustness of its management.\n\nHowever, none of these indicators of value matter if PayPal is trading at a valuation that reflects its reality. To assess this, I consider the earnings yield, which shows how much profit a company generates relative to its market price. Currently, PayPal has an earnings yield of 5.3% over the last twelve months, which exceeds the 10-year Treasury yield of 3.7%. This difference suggests that the market may not yet fully recognize PayPal's growth potential and cash generation capabilities. If the company can maintain or increase this earnings yield, it will provide a strong argument for its future valuation.\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nPayPal's stock has suffered significant declines in recent years, primarily due to its overvaluation and industry pressures that have slowed both revenue and profit growth. However, the company's fundamentals remain solid, with recent performance reflecting trends consistent with its historically high-value trajectory.\n\nWhile it may be unlikely for PayPal to reach its previous highs above $300 per share in the near future, its strong fundamentals and attractive metrics, such as earnings yield, suggest there is substantial value yet to be unlocked. Therefore, I view PayPal not as a value trap but as a company with considerable upside potential.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Pivotal Research Group initiated coverage of Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a Buy rating, highlighting the company's strong competitive position and potential for growth in cloud computing and AI.\n\nGoogle, which holds about 90% of the global search market share outside of China, is also recognized for its dominance in video/audio streaming through YouTube and its leading web browser, Chrome.\n\nGoogle's search business was deemed a monopoly in August, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) and a judge are considering remedies that could significantly impact the company's ability to leverage its market position.\n\nDespite this, Pivotal views the current valuation of Google as reflecting conservative post-2027 search revenue declines. Potential regulatory outcomes are not expected to be resolved soon, but Pivotal suggests that a Kamala Harris victory could lead to more favorable settlements for Google.\n\nIn a separate note, Pivotal also initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating, setting a year-end 2025 target price of $780.\n\nMeta, known for its extensive portfolio of social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, is praised for its management's ability to innovate and respond to competition.\n\n“Looking forward we see a strong revenue growth outlook from increased usage/new products/better targeting/higher prices boosted by cost efficiencies (enabled by AI) and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation at 24X ’25 EPS,” Pivotal analysts said in the note.\n\nThe firm also acknowledges risks such as potential regulation and market dominance investigations, as well as the challenges posed by Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in AI.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $390.63 billion and $424.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.9% and +8.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple launches new professional learning resources for teachers and expands global education grant program",
        "content": "CUPERTINO, Calif., October 01, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In celebration of World Teachers’ Day, Apple® today launched all-new free classroom resources to help educators and students embrace creativity in any lesson, and is celebrating educators through special collections and offerings across Apple services. Additionally, the company announced a major expansion of its groundbreaking education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, reaching students and teachers across six continents with free grant-funded STEAM programming.\n\nOver the past four decades, Apple has been a committed educational leader. Through its work in education, the company has shared its cutting-edge technology and professional learning resources with millions of students and educators, equipping them with the tools to create new worlds, connect in engaging ways, and pursue the jobs of tomorrow. To illustrate the reach of its efforts, Apple is also releasing its first-ever Education Impact Report, which provides a snapshot of the work the company is doing to support teachers and learners worldwide.\n\n\"At Apple, we have always believed in the power of education to open new doors and give people the tools they need to build a better, more equitable world,\" said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. \"We’re blown away to see how tomorrow’s coders, creators, innovators, and leaders are using Apple technology and resources to make their impact known today — and we’re thrilled to expand our education work into even more communities.\"\n\n\"We’re inspired by the incredible work coming out of classrooms and communities across the globe, and the myriad of ways Apple products like Mac and iPad empower learners to create and build on their passions,\" said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Education and Enterprise Marketing. \"Our new Creative Activities for early learners and students make learning easy and fun, and most importantly, give educators quick tools to engage learners of all ages.\"\n\nSupporting Teachers and Community Educators with New Tools\n\nOver the course of Apple’s long history in education, professional learning and educator resources have always been key parts of the company’s approach, as the effective use of technology can help unlock the potential of all learners.\n\nToday, Apple is launching new Everyone Can Create® resources for teachers. Creative Activities are a collection of quick, interactive, and fun lesson ideas that empower educators to sprinkle imagination and originality into their learning plans. Creative Activities for Early Learners (ages 4 to 8) and Creative Activities for Students (ages 8 and up) enable teachers to engage their students without increasing their workload. Each activity strengthens essential skills and gets students creating quickly with templates and shareable links.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew Creative Activities include:\n\nDrawing: Reveal a Constellation Photo: Create a Sticker Collage Video: See More in Slo-Mo Music: Lay Down a Beat\n\nThe new Creative Activities are now available in the Apple Education Community, a professional learning hub with more than 1 million members where educators can find inspiration, share resources, and connect with peers. This week, the Apple Education Community is expanding its Forum collaboration features to 16 additional countries and regions, enabling participation from even more educators around the world.1\n\nIn addition, Apple continues to expand Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that helps educators coach teachers on how to get the most out of Apple products. With new lessons and the ability to register and participate at any time, Apple Learning Coach is now available in eight languages across 15 countries and regions.2 To date, more than 4,000 certified Apple Learning Coaches have guided nearly 100,000 teachers, impacting 2.4 million students.\n\nReaching Students and Teachers on Six Continents Through Grant Programs\n\nApple works with schools and nonprofit organizations around the world to provide grants and other hands-on programming designed to expand access to technology, along with educational and workforce opportunities. To date, the company has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in technology, tools, and resources to more than 200 education and community partners. In the last year alone, Apple has expanded its support to nearly 40 new education partners across Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThis work is largely connected to Apple’s Community Education Initiative, through which the company provides hardware, scholarships, financial support, educator resources, and access to Apple experts to schools and organizations in under-resourced communities. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community’s specific goals and transform students’ in-school and extracurricular experiences.\n\nApple’s extensive education initiatives also include Apple Developer Academies and the Apple Foundation Program, which bring coding education and skills training to developers and entrepreneurs around the world, along with free resources like Everyone Can Code®, Develop in Swift Tutorials, Everyone Can Create, Challenge for Change, and Today at Apple® sessions at all Apple Store® locations.\n\nAs detailed in the newly released Education Impact Report, in the past five years, more than 10,000 teachers have received professional learning opportunities through Apple grants. Over that same time frame, 500,000 students in close to 2,000 schools and communities around the world have engaged in the company’s grant programs. Apple currently supports more than 200 schools and nonprofit organizations — a number that continues to increase.\n\nForging New Partnerships and Deepening Existing Work\n\nCodeDoor, one of Apple’s newer partners, provides coding and workforce preparedness training for migrants throughout Germany. Apple supports the organization’s Creators program, which uses Everyone Can Code resources and Swift Playgrounds® to give participants the tools to design and pitch apps as solutions to community challenges. Through a hybrid experience that takes place over the course of eight months, participants acquire valuable skills, including coding with Swift® and presentation techniques.\n\n\"CodeDoor was created from the idea that young people are curious and approach learning as a process of discovery, but need the right tools to feel empowered,\" said Karan Dehghani, CodeDoor’s founder. \"With support from Apple, our Creators program teaches learners from migrant families how to identify and solve real-life problems through app development — equipping a new generation of Germans with the skills they need to build community and a brighter future.\"\n\nApple is also deepening its work with existing community partners. Since 2020, the company has collaborated with the New York Public Library to expand access to technology through in-person and virtual training classes for learners of all ages and skill levels, with a focus on helping adults develop confidence in their computer skills and grow more comfortable in today’s digital world.\n\n\"The world is evolving so fast. One of the ways that we can help shape and ensure the future of libraries is to create spaces that are designed for collaborative, interactive learning,\" said Brandy McNeil, Ph.D., the New York Public Library’s deputy director of Branch Programs & Services. \"With the tools and resources only Apple can provide, we’ve been able to expand both our programming and our reach to better serve our community, helping many more people harness the power of technology to learn and grow.\"\n\nCelebrating World Teachers’ Day Across Apple\n\nIn honor of World Teachers’ Day, Apple is celebrating educators around the world through special collections and offerings across its services.\n\nThe Great Tools for Teachers collection in the App Store® highlights classroom and lesson-planning essentials that educators can use to support their work. On Apple Music®, users can listen to a collection of learning-based albums and playlists highlighted throughout the Kids and Family categories; on Apple Books®, readers can explore a collection of nonfiction and kids’ books about inspiring educators; and in Podcasts, listeners can find featured shows focusing on conversations by and for educators alongside narratives about education. Additionally, the Apple TV® app features a collection of movies and shows that highlight the importance of teachers in the lives of pupils.\n\nAcross the world, teachers can use Group Reservations to book a Today at Apple session for their students at their local Apple Store, selecting from more than 20 topics great for educators and their students to learn how to code, create, and get the most out of Apple products. Learn more and request a session at apple.com/today/groups.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is hosting a special session for teachers at Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino, California, on World Teachers’ Day (October 5). The Go Further with iPadOS 18 for Education workshop will bring together certified Apple Learning Coaches and educators from across California for hands-on demos using iPad Pro® and Apple Pencil Pro™.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple’s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\n1.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – October 1, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS and Tucows Inc. TCX.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Tesla and T-Mobile US\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Tesla, Inc. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Tucows Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have gained +18.8% over the year-to-date against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry's gain of +19.5%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.\r\n\r\nApple expects the September quarter's (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nTesla's shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+4.9% vs. +1.8%). Amid competition intensifying in the EV space the company focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.\r\n\r\nThe expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA's Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.\r\n\r\nOf late, Tesla has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of T-Mobile US have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+30.0% vs. +29.9%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. In the second quarter, the company added 1.3 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 301,000, both metrics being the best in the industry.\r\n\r\nTMUS' 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against the companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum.\r\n\r\nHowever, owing to the stock's premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. The high debt burden is a concern. Stiff competition is straining profitability. We are reiterating our Neutral recommendation.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile US here >>>)\r\n\r\nTucows' shares have gained +8.3% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Content industry's gain of +14.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $230.64 million continues to see strong subscriber growth, with a 25% year-over-year increase to 48,200 in second-quarter 2024. Revenues rose 17% to $14.6 million, supported by expanding infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTing's gross margin grew 39% year over year, reflecting cost management and efficiency gains. The company completed a $63-million asset-backed securitization, helping fund its fiber expansion while reducing capital risk.\r\n\r\nHowever, rising debt and liquidity concerns due to declining cash raise risks. Depreciation costs and challenges in customer acquisition add pressure as Ting competes with larger ISPs. Additionally, Tucows Domains saw a 3% decline in transactions, and continued pressure in this stable business could affect the overall performance. Slower fiber network expansion and increasing competition can hinder growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tucows here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Apple may need to turn to China after Indian Tata plant fire, sources say",
        "content": "By Munsif Vengattil\n\nBENGALURU (Reuters) - Extensive damage from a fire at Tata Group's Apple iPhone component plant in southern India could hamper production ahead of a festive season sales surge, an industry watcher and a source said, forcing the U.S. firm's suppliers to arrange critical parts from China or elsewhere.\n\nThe weekend blaze has caused an indefinite production halt at Tata's Hosur plant in Tamil Nadu, the only Indian supplier of iPhone back panels and some other parts for both contract manufacturer Foxconn in the country and its own iPhone assembly at another plant.\n\nHong Kong-based Counterpoint Research told Reuters it estimates local sales of 1.5 million units of iPhone 14 and 15 models during the Indian festive season which runs from late October to early November, with Apple struggling to fulfil as much as 15% of that demand due to the fire.\n\n\"There will be a 10-15% impact on production of older iPhone models from India. Apple could offset that impact by importing more components, and by re-routing more export inventory towards India,\" said Neil Shah, a co-founder of Counterpoint, which has for years tracked Apple's global shipments.\n\nApart from local sales, Tata, one of India's biggest conglomerates, also exported iPhones to the Netherlands and United States as well as some parts to China, worth more than $250 million overall, in the year to Aug. 31, commercially available customs data shows.\n\nTata declined to comment.\n\nApple suppliers typically carry a three- to four-week stock of back panels, Counterpoint said. An industry source with direct knowledge of the matter estimated, however, that Apple was likely to have stock for eight weeks, and therefore would not see an immediate impact.\n\nHowever, they added that if the production suspension continues, the U.S. company could set up another assembly line in China or add shifts there to secure parts for India's iPhone manufacturers.\n\nSupply chain disruptions more generally have cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to attract foreign investors to \"Make in India\", especially in the electronics sector.\n\nApple has been diversifying beyond China but last year separate fire incidents in India caused suppliers Foxlink and Pegatron to briefly halt operations, with authorities finding much of the fire safety equipment at Foxlink's facility was not functional. Contractors Wistron and Foxconn have also been hit by labour unrest in recent years.\n\n\"These are temporary setbacks,\" said Prabhu Ram, vice president at Cybermedia Research. \"Continued efforts to improve safety and operational standards are crucial for strengthening India's position as an emerging global electronics manufacturing hub.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTata is among Apple's newest suppliers in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total global iPhone shipments this year, up from 12-14% last year.\n\nThe fire-hit plant employed 20,000 workers. Another unit in the same Tata complex was due to start making complete iPhones later this year and it is unclear if the incident will cause this to be delayed.\n\nTata has another iPhone plant near Bengaluru, which it acquired from Wistron last year, and a second one in Tamil Nadu near Chennai, which it is set to acquire from Pegatron.\n\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Kalra, Kirsten Donovan)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nMarket Strategist Says The Economy May Re-Accelerate on its Own\n\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\n\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\n\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\n\nThe Fed is Thinking About Growth\n\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\n\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\n\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the company behind the iPhone, is one of the best stocks to buy for the long term. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offers services such as iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, and Apple TV+.\n\nIn the FQ3 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logged $85.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up by 5% year-over-year. Of this, the iPhone reported revenue worth $39.3 billion and Mac revenue was $7 billion, up by 2% from a year ago. Apple’s economic moat lies in its consistent financial performance. Over the past 10 years, the company has grown its revenues and net income by 8% and 10%, respectively.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system backed by AI. Apple Intelligence is integrated into all new iPhone, iPad, and Mac models. The launch of iPhone 16 and iOS 18 is expected to drive strong financial results for the company for the rest of 2024.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AAPL and their 12-month median price target of $250 points to a 10% upside from current levels. Overall, AAPL was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. According to the Insider Monkey database,  Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion\n\nColumbia Contrarian Core Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – Despite the stock falling after announcing earnings in late May, Apple regained ground toward the end of the quarter, fueled by the company’s long-awaited AI announcement at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WDC). At the conference, the company showcased some of its new AI features powered by Apple Intelligence that would be coming to Apple products and also announced a partnership with ChatGPT. Investors greatly welcomed the announcement of Apple’s AI strategy and the stock surged, passing Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company (although this hallmark wouldn’t last). Beta testing of these new features will be coming later this summer, but the initial promise and excitement looks to be a potential catalyst for an upgrade cycle, as the company looks to persuade users who have had the same smartphone for years to consider an upgrade.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley andJim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL)\n\nThe world's most valuable company, Apple, closed near its all-time high on Monday. The stock ended the previous session 2.3% higher at $233 (£175) per share, just below the high of $234.82 it hit in July.\n\nThis took the tech giant's market capitalisation up to $3.5tn.\n\nUS markets more broadly notched fresh records on the final day of the quarter, with the S&P 500 closing 0.4% in the green.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets cautious as Israel starts ground invasion in Lebanon\n\nLooking at Apple specifically, Barron's reported that a Morgan Stanley note on Monday referred to stabilising lead times for some iPhone 16 models.\n\nThere had been some concern, following the launch of the new iPhone in September, that early demand for the latest model was lagging 2023 levels.\n\nOther megacap tech companies also ended Monday's session in positive territory, with Google-owner Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) up more than 1% and social media giant Meta Platforms (META) up nearly 1%.\n\nGreggs (GRG.L)\n\nShares in sausage roll-maker Greggs dipped 5% on Tuesday morning, after it reported a slowdown in underlying sales growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe food-on-the-go retailer said like-for-like sales in this latest quarter were up 5%, versus 6.5% year-to-date, and slower than the 7.4% growth it reported in the first half.\n\nHowever, Greggs said that it was \"acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, [and] the board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations\".\n\nThe British baker also said it expected the overall level of cost inflation for the year to be towards the lower end of the 4% to 5% range that it previously mentioned.\n\nRead more: The top gold funds to invest in as prices soar\n\nIn terms of new products, Greggs said it had launched a pumpkin spiced doughnut as part of its autumn menu. The chain said it was also on track to open between 140 and 160 net new shops in 2024.\n\nMamta Valechha, retail equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \"We continue to like Greggs; the group ranks highly on price perception and quality among coffee shops and quick service restaurants. There is significant growth potential in London and south-east England, and Greggs remains second only to McDonald’s in monthly active app users.\"\n\nDespite Tuesday's fall in share price, Greggs is still up 14% year-to-date.\n\nStellantis (STLAM.MI)\n\nCarmaker Stellantis tumbled in Monday's session, after it cut its outlook for the full-year.\n\nThe company warned adjusted operating income (AOI) margins were now expected to be between 5.5% and 7%, down from the double digits it had previously forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Roughly two-thirds of the reduced AOI margin is driven by corrective actions in North America,\" Stellantis said. \"Other contributors include lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year across most regions.\"\n\nRead more: What are share buybacks?\n\nThe carmaker also said it now expected to see negative cashflow for the year of between €5bn (£4.2bn) and €10bn.\n\nThe company also reportedly said on Monday that it was recalling 194,000 plug-in hybrid jeeps over fire risk.\n\nStellantis wasn't the only European carmaker to fall in the previous session, as Aston Martin (AML.L) also slumped after warning on profits.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nTechnology company Super Micro Computer underwent a 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on Monday.\n\nStock splits increase the number of shares in circulation, which reduces the share price, broadening accessibility to a wider range of investors.\n\nA number of companies have announced stock splits this year, including chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and retailer Walmart (WMT).\n\nRead more: Funds set to benefit from falling interest rates\n\nShares in Super Micro fell sharply last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities.\n\nIn August, the company announced that it would be delayed in filing its annual report. A day prior to that announcement, Hindenburg Research disclosed it had taken a short position in the company and claimed it had found \"fresh evidence of accounting manipulation\".\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Market-Leading Stocks That May Plunge if Donald Trump Wins in November",
        "content": "Exactly five weeks from today, on Nov. 5, voters from across the country will weigh in and decide which presidential nominee -- former President Donald Trump or current Vice President Kamala Harris -- will lead our nation forward over the next four years.\n\nWhat happens on Capitol Hill doesn't always have relevance to Wall Street. But elections ultimately determine which president and political parties will shape fiscal policy over the next, at minimum, two years. Understanding the economic policy proposals of the two presidential candidates does have bearing for the investing community and corporate America. Former President Trump speaking with reporters. Image source: Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks.\n\nFor former President Donald Trump, his message has remained similar to what he echoed during his 2020 campaign. He's proposed a handful of new personal tax breaks, wants to further reduce the corporate tax rate to spur economic growth, is a big promoter of domestic energy production, and plans to get tougher with China.\n\nWhile there are some pretty clear winners of this potential scenario, there are also time-tested and/or high-flying stocks that can end up as losers.\n\nWhat follows are three market-leading stocks that can plunge if Donald Trump wins in November.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first widely held stock that may be contending with some difficult headwinds if Trump wins in five weeks is Wall Street's leading artificial intelligence (AI) company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nAs most investors are probably aware, Nvidia's stock has enjoyed a historic ascent, with the company benefiting from a textbook expansion of its operations. In short order, Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) became the undisputed preferred choice for businesses running generative AI solutions and building/training large language models.\n\nThough the prospect of lowering the corporate tax rate could, at least temporarily, juice Nvidia's gross margin and allow it to hang onto more of its income, another key aspect of Trump's economic plan has the potential to limit Nvidia's upside.\n\nSpecifically, Trump plans to take a hardline stance with China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. He's proposed a 60% tariff on goods imported into the U.S. from China. Although Nvidia isn't importing products from China, the global No. 2 economy has consistently been a key generator of sales for Nvidia. The potential for Trump to spark a trade war may eliminate China's desire altogether to purchase chips from California-based Nvidia.\n\nTo add to the above, regulators under the Biden administration have, on two occasions, limited Nvidia's ability to export its high-powered AI-GPUs to China over the last two years. I'd deem it unlikely that Trump or his administration would ease or lift these restrictions, which are capping Nvidia's revenue potential in a key market.\n\nStory continues\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that every next-big-thing technology, trend, and innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption and utility of game-changing innovations, and AI seems unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule. If the AI bubble were to burst under a Trump presidency, arguably no company would feel the sting more than Nvidia. Electric vehicle tax credits may be eliminated by Trump. Image source: Tesla.\n\nTesla\n\nA second market leader that may be set to plummet if Donald Trump wins a second term is electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nTesla has used its first-mover advantages to build itself from the ground up to producing in the neighborhood of 2 million EVs annually on a run-rate basis. It became the first EV company to generate a recurring profit and is attempting to diversify its operations by expanding into energy storage.\n\nAlthough former President Trump has hinted at giving Tesla CEO Elon Musk a position in his administration if reelected in November, he's also been critical of EV tax credits and tax incentives. While Trump hasn't concretely said he'd do away with the $7,500 EV tax credit for new purchases, his statements suggest this is a real possibility.\n\nTax credits play an important role in providing a potential price advantage for EVs, when compared to internal combustion-engine vehicles. If this credit is removed, arguably the most-enticing competitive edge for EVs goes away -- especially with EV charging infrastructure still somewhat limited.\n\nTo add to the above, Tesla's reliance on unsustainable sources of income -- specifically, interest income earned on its cash and automotive regulatory tax credits -- have rapidly increased as a percentage of pre-tax income. In the June-ended quarter, approximately 66% of Tesla's pre-tax income came from these two sources, with $890 million of its $1.89 billion pre-tax profit from regulatory credits.\n\nIt's also unclear how Trump's tariff policy will affect domestic and international sales of EVs for American-based companies. Tesla has been aggressively reducing the sales price of its EVs (Model's 3, S, X, and Y) since the start of 2023 to counter growing competition and rising inventory levels. Unfortunately, these price cuts haven't stopped inventory levels from rising on a year-over-year basis, and they've clobbered the company's operating margin.\n\nEven if Musk were to land a role in the Trump administration, Tesla is a stock that would likely struggle with the former president back in the Oval Office.\n\nApple\n\nThe third magnificent stock that may be poised to plunge if Donald Trump wins in November is Wall Street's largest company by market cap, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAlthough Apple's stock has soared in 2024 on the heels of its AI ambitions and excitement surrounding the eventual incorporation of AI tools into its top-selling iPhone, it's the company's Services segment that's been the real highlight for years. CEO Tim Cook is overseeing a transformation that will see Apple become a platforms company. A subscription-driven model should lift its operating margin, smooth out the sales fluctuations that occur during iPhone upgrade cycles, and further enhance the company's impressive customer loyalty.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, it might also benefit from a further reduction of the corporate tax rate. Apple has repurchased a market-leading $700.6 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013 and reduced its outstanding share count by 42.2% in the process. A lower corporate tax rate may encourage even more buybacks.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple imports some of its products from China, is reliant on a meaningful portion of its iPhone sales from China, and the overwhelming majority of its iPhones (along with Macs and iPads) are assembled in China. Between tariffs and the potential anti-American sentiment caused by a trade war with China, Apple could see its already stalling growth engine come to a complete halt.\n\nThough buybacks have played a key role in lifting Apple's earnings per share over the last 11 years, what ails Apple's growth engine can't be fixed with the market's leading share repurchase program. Even a reduction in corporate tax rates won't be enough offset the persistent sales weakness Apple has been contending with across all of its physical product lines.\n\nWhile tech stocks and all three major stock indexes thrived under Trump's first term in office, it's my prediction that Apple will flounder if Trump wins in November.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The offer, which values the cotton processor at A$158 million, is scheduled to close on Oct. 9. Samuel Terry Asset Management, Namoi’s biggest shareholder, had accepted its offer, Dreyfus said.\n\nNamoi shares rose as much as 8.8% to A$0.7725 at 12:53 p.m. in Sydney. The stock has rallied 61% this year.\n\nThe rival crop traders have been jostling to buy Namoi since January to gain a bigger foothold in Australia, the world’s sixth-largest cotton producer. Dreyfus’s most recent offer has set it up to close the deal, and made an Olam takeover substantially less likely.\n\nOlam’s most recent bid of A$0.75 a share was recommended by Namoi’s independent directors and major shareholders last month, but is still conditional on pending approval from Australia’s regulatory watchdog, which has raised competition concerns.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australian retail sales rose by more than expected in August as tax cuts and warmer weather encouraged households to spend more on dining out and on clothing and footwear, reinforcing the case for interest rates to remain on hold for the time being.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai’s Sky-High Rents Gang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon’s Fast-Growing Cities New Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century Climate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World’s Megacities Vanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\n\nSales advanced 0.7% from the prior month, exceeding a 0.4% estimate in the biggest monthly increase since January, official figures showed on Tuesday. The outcome follows an upwardly revised 0.1% result in July.\n\nIn response, the currency and yields on policy-sensitive three-year government bonds edged higher.\n\n“More people were out dining at cafes and restaurants enjoying the warm end to the winter months,” said Robert Ewing, ABS head of business statistics. “This year was the warmest August on record since 1910.”\n\nRetail sales can be an important consideration in policy decisions given consumption accounts for more than half of gross domestic product. The Reserve Bank has repeatedly highlighted the outlook for household spending as a key uncertainty following 13 rate hikes between May 2022 and November 2023.\n\nTuesday’s data showed retail sales rose 3.1% from a year earlier, compared with 1.7% in August 2023. The improvement comes as the government’s tax cuts and energy rebates kicked in on July 1. The household savings ratio has also fallen.\n\nThe RBA meets again in November, with economists and markets predicting its next move will be down. The rate-setting board has set a high bar to tightening further, while saying it’s still premature to consider cuts.\n\nThe consensus among economists is that the RBA will hold rates at 4.35% this year, though some believe a cut in November can’t be ruled out, particularly if third-quarter inflation at the end of this month surprises on the downside.\n\nTuesday’s retail data also showed:\n\nDepartment stores led the gains, up 1.6%, followed by clothing, footwear and personal accessories Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services climbed 1% as people took advantage of the warmer weather, the ABS said Household goods retailing, down 0.3%, was the only industry to fall\n\n(Adds further details from report.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Great €3 Billion Shipping Container Heist Military Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US Sports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought The Presidential Election Isn’t Stopping International Students From Coming to America Apple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

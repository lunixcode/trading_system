        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\n\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\n\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\n\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\n\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\n\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\n\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities’ PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\n\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\n\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 219\n\nGS' Number Of Funds: 77\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it enjoys a sizeable user base of more than 3.2 billion people as of March. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a wide moat in the social media sector, as it only has to improve its services to ensure user retention instead of having to focus on growth like other companies. Additionally, the keys to its hypothesis are its ability to ensure that users spend more time on its platform and the ability to monetize this time spent. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) focuses on two broad based monetization strategies. The first is based on targeting its products like WhatsApp to business users and the second is using new technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve ad placement and drive up ad sales to advertisers. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also a key player in the AI race and has announced new features that it can monetize such as AI Studio which lets anyone on its platform create AI.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s management shared details for Meta Studio during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"And this week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps.\n\nI think the creators are especially going to find this quite valuable. There are millions of creators across our apps, and these are people who want to engage more with their communities, and their communities want to engage more with them, but there are only so many hours in the day. So now they are going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people’s questions, create content and more. So I’m quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators too. Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends. Business AIs are the other big piece here. We’re still in Alpha testing with more and more businesses.\n\nThe feedback we’re getting is positive so far. Over time, I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an email address, in the future I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. And our goal is to make it easy for every small business, eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue. There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I’m excited about too, but I’ll save those for another day when we’re ready to roll them out. The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models.\"\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\n\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\n\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company has taken a somewhat different approach to AI than the other tech giants. While the large language models (LLMs) of other AI firms are closed, Meta has decided to open source Llama, the LLM it has developed over the past few years. Companies and businesses can develop their own AI supermodels, tailored to their specific needs, around Llama.\n\nThis Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) strategy is already starting to bear fruit. Major companies have already started making their own AI models with Llama as a base. For example, professional services firm Accenture utilized Llama 3.1 to build a custom large language model to produce an annual ESG report. Telecom firm AT&T is using Llama and generative AI for customer service.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\n\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\n\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nREAD ALSO10 Best Small-Cap AI Stocks to Buy and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "title": "Trump warns Mark Zuckerberg could ‘spend the rest of his life in prison’",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump escalated his longstanding feud with Mark Zuckerberg by threatening the Meta CEO with prison time.\n\nTrump accused Zuckerberg of “plotting” against him during the 2020 election by “steering” Facebook against his campaign. Trump warned that if Zuckerberg were to do so again in the 2024 election, he would “spend the rest of his life in prison.”\n\nThe comments come in a new book authored by Trump called Save America. The book features photos from Trump’s term in office with captions describing the events. Trump’s threat against Zuckerberg was in a caption depicting a meeting between the two in the Oval Office.\n\nPages from Trump's new book where he threatens to imprison Mark Zuckerberg for life, and has kind words for Kim Jong Un and Putin https://t.co/3bqGCkyUN6 by @katiadoylpic.twitter.com/S6AC5gC1mX\n\n— Amanda Terkel (@aterkel) August 30, 2024\n\nTrump began by noting that Zuckerberg would visit him at the Oval Office. “He would bring his very nice wife to dinners, be as nice as anyone could be, while always plotting to install shameful Lock Boxes [sic] in a true PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. ”\n\nHe then accused Zuckerberg of acting disingenuously by praising him and then turning Facebook against his unsuccessful reelection campaign.\n\n“He told me there was nobody like Trump on Facebook. But at the same time, and for whatever reason, steered it against me,” Trump’s caption continues. “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison—as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.”\n\nMeta and Winning Team Publishing, the publisher of Save America, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOver the years Trump has made similar threats to other perceived enemies. During a debate in the 2016 election he memorably told former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton she’d “be in jail” if he was elected. Trump campaign rallies often featured the chant “lock her up” in reference to Clinton. At another rally in October 2022 Trump advocated for jailing a journalist in order to get them to reveal a source.\n\nThere is no evidence that Zuckerberg was involved in a plot against Trump while he was in office. Nor did Trump’s allegations cite any specific law that Zuckerberg may have broken. The mention of “Lock Boxes” appears to be a reference to a $420 million donation Zuckerberg’s charity made to fund election infrastructure during in 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrump has repeatedly feuded with Zuckerberg over the years. In July, Trump made the same accusations that Zuckerberg was interfering in elections.\n\n“All I can say is that if I’m elected President, we will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “We already know who you are. DON’T DO IT! ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!”\n\nZuckerberg attempted to extend an olive branch to Trump after the failed assassination attempt against him in July, praising his bravery. “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life,” Zuckerberg said a few days after the shooting.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox Business, Trump said Zuckerberg called him several times after the assassination attempt, including to tell him he wouldn’t be endorsing a Democrat. Meta noted he has refrained from endorsing either candidate, as he's done in prior elections.\n\nEarlier this week, Zuckerberg waded further into politics, writing a letter to the House Judiciary Committee about Meta’s handling of government requests about COVID-19-related content in 2021. Senior officials from the Biden administration “repeatedly pressured” Meta to remove some types of COVID-19 content, “including humor and satire,” according to the letter.\n\n“I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,” Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nIn the letter, he also mentioned the donations he made that provided things like staffing and training for local poll workers during the 2020 election which was severely impacted by the pandemic. In 2020, Zuckerberg’s philanthropic organization that he co-runs with his wife Priscilla Chan, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, made donations to the Center for Election Innovation & Research and the Center for Tech and Civic Life.\n\n“We are doubling down on our commitment to ensuring that every qualified jurisdiction has the resources it needs to allow every eligible citizen to vote safely and have their vote counted,” Chan and Zuckerberg said in a statement at the time of their donation.\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe donations received backlash from conservative groups that mistook them as support for Joe Biden’s candidacy. For that reason, Zuckerberg said he would not make such donations in the 2024 election.\n\n“Despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other,” Zuckerberg wrote. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying",
        "content": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG’s estimate of 64 cents.\n\nThe gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter’s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.\n\nData center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia’s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of strong Hopper demand.\n\nDelay of Blackwell chip rollout.\n\nThe full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nCompetition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia’s efforts.\n\nSecond to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia’s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Want to Buy the Nvidia Dip? Here Are 2 ETFs You Should Take a Look At",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.\n\nThe best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.\n\nA rising tide lifts all chipmakers\n\nNvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.\n\nFor one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.\n\nThis is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.\n\nSo, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.\n\nNvidia isn't the only megacap that has pulled back\n\nAlthough Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.\n\nCompany (Symbol) Percent Below 52-Week High Nvidia (NVDA) 10.4% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 13.7% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 1% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 2.9% Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10.2% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 23% Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) 13%\n\nData source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that these stocks have become \"cheap\" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio.

        "title": "Power doesn’t always mean profit: What builders of digital ecosystems can learn from the metaverse",
        "content": "Digitalization marches on, AI continues its rise—and a handful of tech companies are doing very well indeed. The supremacy of these big tech firms increasingly depends on their ability to stand up and manage digital ecosystems with a rich constellation of “complementors”: firms or individual developers collaborating and co-creating to generate something of value for the end customer.\n\nSuch ecosystems are set to become more important for more firms, as economies increasingly rely on digital technologies. That’s why a widening range of companies will need to develop ecosystem strategies based on a clear understanding of what makes an ecosystem successful—whether they are “orchestrators” building the ecosystem, or complementors contributing to and transacting within it.\n\nTwo recent developments should prompt reflection on the dilemma between openness and control in the design of ecosystems. On the one hand, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has publicly articulated his vision of, and arguments for, an open AI ecosystem, built around the Llama model family. Albeit in a different domain, this is a striking reversal from Meta’s years-long (and notoriously costly) play for a closed, tightly controlled metaverse. On the other hand, Apple has chosen to enter the metaverse, rebranded as “spatial computing,” with a similar model of strict orchestrator control, built around its VisionPro headset. The spatial computing ecosystem that Apple hopes to foster would give it total control of the hardware and operating system that would enable complementors to sell VR and AR experiences\n\nWhat is one to make of these conflicting bets? Apple might be attempting to replicate its exceptional success with the iPhone, leveraging its mettle in creating a user-friendly interface to lock in consumers. However, we argue that an orchestrator’s belief that it must create and control everything itself is, more often than not, a cardinal sin of ecosystem design. Indeed, the lessons from Meta’s foray into the metaverse remain valuable, and applicable beyond web3. First: Total openness and absolute dominance pose a false dilemma for ecosystem orchestrators. And second: Complementors have power to shape the trajectory of a viable, scalable ecosystem.\n\nMeta’s bitter lesson\n\nA decade or so ago, it was Facebook that aspired to extend its social media dominance into a new, orchestrator-dominated virtual realm. The company began pouring resources into building an insular ecosystem where it could exercise total control. It developed its own proprietary devices to offer augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, bought headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, and, as recently as 2021, launched a social VR space called Horizon Worlds. The finishing touch, and a powerful statement of intent, was to rebrand itself as Meta.\n\nThe belief that the metaverse had arrived triggered a gold rush, as tech giants like Microsoft and Apple raced to construct their own immersion-focused ecosystems. But fast-forward a few years and reality has fallen far short of the hype. By 2023, two years after its launch, Meta’s Horizon Worlds had fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, and only 9% of its worlds had been visited by more than 50 people. Meanwhile, U.S. sales of VR headsets and AR glasses crashed, plummeting nearly 40% to $664 million in 2023. That understandably dismayed content creators who were paying fees of up to 47.5% to sell their virtual goods on the platform, shrinking the incentive for these complementors to invest in creating added-value content.\n\nHumbled, Meta belatedly acknowledged that collaboration might ultimately be a better course; it opened up the operating system that powers its line of MetaQuest VR devicesearlier this year. This shift enabled third-party hardware makers to build mixed reality (MR) experiences. Meta also allowed “pre-approved” partners to develop specific use cases: hardware manufacturer Asus would develop a gaming headset under its Republic of Gamers brand, while Lenovo developed MR devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment. In 2022, Meta struck a partnership with Microsoft to bring the immersive tools of Mesh for Microsoft Teams to MetaQuest devices.\n\nMeta’s current approach represents a middle ground between open and closed ecosystems and has allowed it to entice complementors while still controlling who can use its operating system and (to some extent) what for.\n\nModels of ecosystem-building\n\nMeta’s change of heart shows that there’s more than one way for orchestrators to attract and benefit from complementors in their ecosystems. Meta first aspired to a “hardware lock,” where users are locked into proprietary devices, but third parties can create content for them. Microsoft, meanwhile, aimed even higher with its own metaverse play: a “total lock,” where both hardware and software are under the orchestrator’s control.\n\nApple’s strategy is somewhere in between: A hardware lock, with selective and limited opening for complementors. Other companies are exploring different paths: Blockchain game developer Axie pursued a “content lock” where it controlled content creation, but was device-agnostic; and Decentraland, a truly “open platform,” is not only device-agnostic but actively encourages content creation by multiple third parties.\n\nDrawing on our recent research project on the metaverse, we looked at the approaches different orchestrators took, and found that, as a rule, firms that tried to control too much were unable to generate complementor support and ultimately failed. It makes sense then that we’re seeing a broader trend of orchestrators giving up on this “orchestrator takes all” approach and embracing partnerships that instead multiply use cases and drive user adoption.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Apple’s gamble on the sort of hardware-lock, high-fee, and tightly- controlled-content strategy that Meta abandoned will pay off. But for now, it is predictably struggling to entice participation. None of YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix currently offers a dedicated app for Apple’s Vision Pro headset. In fact, 46 of the most popular apps on Apple’s App Store weren’t available on Vision Pro’s launch day. These complementors are tight-lipped on why they’re staying away, but their reluctance is already having an impact, undermining the appeal of Apple’s high-quality user hardware and user experience, and reportedly prompting Apple to cut production targets for the Vision Pro.\n\nLessons for ecosystem participants\n\nEven though Big Tech giants may be tempted to leverage their extraordinary power to impose their will onto a new ecosystem, this not only thwarts complementors—it can often endanger ecosystem success. An effective ecosystem strategy does not always benefit from hardball tactics, as Meta’s own evolution shows. Through its strategic pivot, Meta now hopes to address the two biggest drawbacks to extended reality: sluggish hardware development and clunky experiences that few users enjoy. To do that the company is now betting on the future of an interconnected, interoperable metaverse, and gunning for first-mover advantage when it comes to setting standards for transferable digital identities. And these lessons are now being carried over into Meta’s play in the generative AI space as well.\n\nOpening up the ecosystem means making the social layer within the Horizon OS that powers its Horizon Worlds more appealing to users by allowing profiles to glide seamlessly between virtual spaces, giving them ownership of their virtual identities. Meta’s calculation is that if Horizon OS becomes the engine of users’ social experiences everywhere, the company can harvest customer data and strengthen its existing market position in digital advertising.\n\nEcosystem complementors, that is, the partners who are struggling to compete in a world of tech giants, still have power to influence the ecosystems in which they operate—most importantly, by refusing to do so. For complementors, strategic alignment can substitute for tech power, and clever positioning can make a difference.\n\nIn the new growth area of GenAI-enabled ecosystems, getting the ecosystem strategy right will be crucial for complementors and orchestrators alike. As we’ve argued before, the locus of innovation and investment will overtime move downstream, towards small, domain-specific models that numerous companies will be best positioned to develop “on top” of the foundation models created by leading GenAI startups and hyperscalers.\n\n***\n\nThe metaverse itself is far from dead. In fact, the spatial computing race has only just begun. Which ecosystem-building strategy will prevail: Meta with its new semi-open strategy, or Apple and its “total lock” hardware approach? Or will it be another orchestrator that already dominates the metaverse, like the online game platform Roblox, with 60 million daily active users? One thing is for certain: Orchestrators will have to become much more sophisticated and nuanced in how they run their ecosystems—whether in the virtual world or the real one.\n\nRead other Fortune columns by François Candelon.\n\nFrançois Candelon is a partner at private equity firm Seven2 and the former global director of the BCG Henderson Institute.\n\nMichael G.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Has 31% of His $8.7 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "There's little question that one of the driving forces behind the ongoing bull market is the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and the poster child for that shifting paradigm is Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computational horsepower needed for AI and have quickly become the gold standard. As a result, Nvidia continues to deliver quarter after quarter of record-setting results, which has sent its stock price soaring.\n\nHowever, some investors are concerned that growing competition and the stock's lofty valuation make Nvidia increasingly risky. Consequently, these same investors are looking for other ways to profit from the AI revolution. One place to look for other ideas is among the holdings of successful hedge fund managers.\n\nOne such money manager is Daniel Loeb. The billionaire heads up Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb turned seed money of just $3.4 billion -- raised from family and friends -- into a financial empire with assets under management of $12 billion.\n\nLoeb has left no doubt about the potential implications of AI, calling it \"transformational\" and ultimately sparking a \"profound economic upheaval.\" In fact, the famed investor is so bullish about AI that it's the \"key element of the thesis for nearly half\" the hedge funds stock holdings. Just four stocks make up his largest AI investments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.4% of holdings\n\nThird Point's largest AI holding -- and largest position overall -- is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that he has held continuously since 2019. He notes that AI favors incumbents like Amazon \"who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race.\"\n\nHe's clearly done his homework. Amazon quickly positioned itself to capitalize on the AI opportunity, offering a roster of the most in-demand AI models to its cloud customers, while also creating its own, but that's just the beginning. Amazon is using AI to identify and store inventory 75% more quickly while bringing down order processing times by 25%, giving its legacy online retail business a boost. The company also uses AI to better address the target audience for its digital ads.\n\nLoeb's Amazon position remained unchanged in the second quarter, with a total stake of 5.1 million shares worth about $986 million and nearly 11% of Third Point's portfolio. And at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is an attractively priced way to play the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a longtime Amazon shareholder, I'm completely on board with Loeb. Not only is Amazon the leading provider of e-commerce and cloud computing, but it's also a growing power player in digital advertising. Adding AI into the mix gives Amazon another way to win when the odds are already stacked in its favor.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nThird Point's second-largest AI holding and third-largest overall is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Loeb views the software giant as one of the \"best-run legacy\" companies, which has \"built enormous competitive advantages\" and is well positioned to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nHis logic is irrefutable. Like Amazon, Microsoft offers a wealth of AI models to cloud customers. However, the company's biggest AI opportunity is likely Copilot, Microsoft's suite of AI-powered digital assistants. Designed for a variety of industries and tasks, Copilot can streamline tasks and automate time-consuming chores, thereby increasing productivity. Demand for Copilot has been robust and has also helped boost the adoption of its cloud services. Microsoft's noted in the calendar second quarter that eight points of Azure Cloud's growth were the result of AI services.\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 11% in the second quarter, likely to expand its exposure to other AI stocks (more on that shortly).\n\nMicrosoft stock is selling for a premium at 38 times earnings. However, the company's strong legacy businesses and early positioning in AI show it's deserving of a premium.\n\nI'm a firm believer that Microsoft has a long runway ahead. Generative AI will continue to evolve and Copilot is an early mover in the space. When added to the company's existing businesses, AI gives Microsoft an extraordinary competitive advantage -- which is why I own the stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nLoeb's third largest AI holding and fourth overall is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Loeb hasn't been as vocal about his position in the tech giant but is likely bullish on the recovery in digital advertising, as targeted ads on its social media platforms generate 98% of its revenue. However, Meta also made a surprising move to capitalize on AI, which likely also informed Loeb's decision.\n\nMeta moved into AI contention by quickly developing its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), an AI model that is carried by all the major cloud platforms for a fee. This AI system is fueled by a treasure trove of data from the billions of users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger. AI is a new revenue stream for Meta, so we don't yet know how lucrative it might ultimately be.\n\nThird Point's stake in Meta amounts to 1.1 million shares worth roughly $555 million. Similar to Microsoft, Loeb trimmed his position in the second quarter by about 11%, likely to spread his AI bets (more on this below).\n\nThe stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nI'm equally bullish on Meta Platforms. I think the company's move to leverage its user data to create AI models was nothing short of brilliant. Add to that Meta's ever-expanding advertising prowess and you have the recipe for long-term success.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Apple -- 4.7% of holdings\n\nThere was a notable addition to Third Point's portfolio last quarter, that of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Loeb loaded up, acquiring nearly 2 million shares of the iPhone maker in a stake valued at roughly $411 million and representing nearly 5% of his portfolio.\n\nLoeb noted that while some investors fear Apple may \"be an AI loser,\" he takes a different view. He cited the company's 2.2 billion devices and wide selection of electronic devices as an advantage and believes \" AI-related demand could drive a step-change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.\" He further suggests that the company's recently announced Apple Intelligence -- a suite of AI-powered smartphone features -- will drive \"meaningful demand\" from Apple's installed base.\n\nInvestor sentiment has weighed on Apple stock since early last year, as some fear that AI had left the company behind, but I think that view is myopic. Apple has a long history of taking the time to put its unique stamp on its products and services, which has helped make it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Investors who dismiss Apple do so at their own peril.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nI own all four of these AI-centric stocks and believe they're all worth owning, but two stand out, albeit for different reasons.\n\nSince generative AI kicked off in earnest early last year, Apple stock has gained just 62%, the lowest among our quartet of stocks. Investors are waiting to see what the iPhone maker will unveils during its next product update on September 9. This could be the catalyst Apple needs to send its shares higher.\n\nStrictly from a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms remains the most attractively priced, at less than 26 times earnings, compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nThat said, each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity in the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia investors should've sold the stock a month ago, strategist says",
        "content": "One Nvidia (NVDA) bear warned the time has come for investors to sell.\n\nNvidia failed to meet sky-high expectations when it reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Nvidia reported profits and revenue that topped forecasts but not by as much as investors hoped, delivering its smallest earnings beat in the last six quarters.\n\nNvidia stock fell 6% on Wednesday evening in reaction to the results and continued to slide 4% lower on Thursday afternoon. Year to date, the stock remains up nearly 140%.\n\nWhen asked when it might be time to sell, David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Bahnsen Group, said, \"About a month ago. Two months ago. Today. Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"People are paying for perfection,\" Bahnsen added (video above). \"You're buying Nvidia banking on there being another investor who's a bigger sucker than you are.\"\n\nThe warning from Bahnsen comes as the stock has rallied 1,000% from its October 2022 lows. His call is based on one data point: Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio, which sits just above 56 after earnings but neared 80 in July.\n\nHe offered a reminder that a company and its stock are not the same thing.\n\n\"This is not me bashing on Nvidia,\" Bahnsen said. \"This is a success story. I'm commenting on the valuation — that when you start paying those prices, the risk-reward skew becomes very unattractive.\"\n\nStill, it’s a risk that the 89% of analysts with a Buy rating on the stock are willing to take. The stock has zero Sell ratings, which is understandable considering Nvidia posted $30 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 122% increase over the same period last year.\n\nNvidia's future depends in part on other Big Tech companies. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) are responsible for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai indicated on the company’s earnings call this quarter that the company's spending on artificial intelligence would not slow down. “The one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,” Pichai said. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang waves to the audience at a keynote presentation at COMPUTEX. (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlphabet's investment in AI, which represents a significant portion of Nvidia’s revenue, could be a bullish signal to come. But those business fundamentals aren’t the only focus.\n\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next big question for investors is whether the Street’s reaction to Nvidia results this quarter will be enough to dampen earnings expectations heading into Q3.\n\nFor Bahnsen, it may already be too late.

        "title": "Controversial California bill to prevent AI disasters heads to Newsom despite pushback from Big Tech",
        "content": "California lawmakers passed a sweeping artificial intelligence bill, SB 1047, that seeks to establish safeguards for tech firms developing large AI models. If signed into law, SB 1047 would dramatically alter the way top AI firms operate, leading to pushback from prominent players like OpenAI, Meta (META), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom has not indicated whether he plans to veto SB 1047.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on Wednesday, Salesforce (CRM) CEO Mark Benioff weighed in on the importance of regulation. \"Looking at AI safety it has to be the highest of everybody’s interest to make sure that these AI models do not get out of control,\" Benioff said.\n\n\"And I think that these kinds of ideas are incredibly interesting and need to be fully evaluated. And it’s worthwhile.\"\n\nDemocratic state senator Scott Wiener, who co-authored the bill, says the bill codifies voluntary safety evaluations that large AI labs, such as Meta, have already committed to. The bill requires developers spending over $100 million to build an AI model to perform safety testing before releasing it. They are required to mitigate the risks if testing found the model has the potential to cause \"catastrophic harm.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill, including the 'Godfathers of AI,' Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, say the regulation is crucial to addressing potential harms posed by AI models. They say the government has not done enough to address the threat.\n\n“SB 1047 is a much-needed step towards advancing both safety and long-term innovation in the AI ecosystem, especially incentivizing research and development in AI safety,\" Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, told Yahoo Finance. California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nTesla (TSLA) chief Elon Musk, who also owns xAI, voiced his support this week on X this week, but said it was a \"tough call.\"\n\n\"I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill. For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk has previously urged AI labs to pause the development of systems that can't compete with human-level intelligence, citing potential risks to society. However, he's also been highly critical of state officials in California.\n\nSB 1047 is co-sponsored by the Center for AI Safety Action Fund, Economic Security California Action and Encode Justice. “It is long past due that we hold Big Tech accountable for their outsized influence and unchecked power,” Teri Olle, Director of Economic Security California Action, said on the assembly floor.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We need legislative solutions like SB 1047 to flip the script and ensure the public can decide how critical technology benefits society as a whole.”\n\nA poll released this week by the Artificial Intelligence Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe AI development, found that 7 out of ten Californians support the bill and over 60% of respondents said they would partially blame Gov. Newsom for future AI-related incidents if he vetoes it.\n\nWiener's longtime ally, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, announced that she's against the bill. “I share your desire that AI develops in a safe and sustainable way, and I agree with the overall intention of your legislation,” Breed wrote in a letter to Wiener. “With additional time and collaboration, I am confident we can find a solution that addresses many of the concerns raised in recent months, while still enabling this emerging field to grow in a safe and sustainable way.”\n\nBreed joins a growing list of California Democrats in Congress who oppose the measure including: former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan, and Lou Correa.\n\nThe bill was amended several times to assuage the fears of AI opponents including Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Some of the major amendments include: removing the state regulatory body formerly called the Frontier Model Division, and removing criminal penalties while civil penalties remain.\n\nAdditionally, if an open-source developer spends less than $10 million fine-tuning an existing model, the liability would rest with the model's original developer. The Attorney General's ability to seek civil penalties has been amended to only if \"a harm has occured or there is an imminent threat to public safety.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom has until September 30 to sign or veto the bill. When asked whether he's confident it will become law, Wiener said: \"the governor has made statements that are very consistent with my own thinking — that regulation could be appropriate here and we want to make sure we’re fostering innovation as well.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 16 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nIn recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\n\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): AI Tools Deliver Ad Growth\n\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Unlike other tech giants who are spending big on AI and have little monetization to show for their investments, Meta has been able to deliver on important metrics like ad impressions and price per ad, both of which have grown 10% year-on-year in the second quarter compared to the previous year, following the deployment of AI tools. This translates into earnings as well. The consensus EPS estimate for 2025 and 2026 forecasts EPS growth of close to 15% for Meta Platforms.\n\nThis AI monetization by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been appreciated by analysts on Wall Street. Tigress Financial recently raised the price target on the stock to $645 from $575 and kept a Strong Buy rating, noting that the increasing cash flow of the firm was enabling ongoing investments in artificial intelligence initiatives that drive increasing user engagement, better content, and a more effective advertising experience.\n\nOverall, META ranks 4th on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): A Beginner Stock You Should Check Out",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other beginner stocks.\n\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\n\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\n\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\n\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\n\nOpportunities and Caution for New Investors Due to Consumer Behaviour\n\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\n\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven’t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\n\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven’t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\n\nThe Market is Healthy but Caution is Advised\n\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\n\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n“According to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\n\nAccording to Bruce Kasman, global growth is steady at 2.4%, with improved recoveries in Western Europe and emerging markets, along with a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Despite this, core global inflation is projected to remain around 3% in 2024, which could limit the potential for policy easing. Kasman warned that achieving inflation control and rate normalization might weaken demand and could interact with political factors to cause further inflation and central bank tightening.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 31.07%\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), previously known as Facebook, Inc., is a prominent American multinational technology company. It operates through two primary business divisions, Family of Apps and Reality Labs.\n\nThe Family of Apps segment features platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, generating revenue mainly through advertising sales. This division enables users to connect, share content, and interact with various communities while offering secure messaging tools for personal and group communications.\n\nOn the other hand, the Reality Labs segment focuses on augmented and virtual reality, encompassing consumer hardware, software, and content. This includes products such as the Oculus VR headsets and Facebook Reality Labs, which spearheads the company's AR/VR research and development efforts.\n\nAdditionally, the company has been expanding the offerings of Metaverse, utilizing artificial intelligence and immersive technologies to craft unique experiences. The company is actively promoting several AI-driven products, including Meta AI, a virtual assistant powered by AI, and smart devices like Meta Smart Glasses and Meta Quest, which use AI to deliver advanced computational capabilities directly to users.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself as a dominant force in the digital landscape, owing to its vast user base and advanced technological infrastructure. With 3.27 billion daily active users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, it holds an impressive amount of first-party data. This extensive user engagement provides a critical advantage in developing and refining AI models, which is essential for maintaining a competitive edge.\n\nThe company's investment in technology is substantial. It has acquired nearly 600,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs, a top-tier component for AI computing, and is also developing its own custom chip to further improve its capabilities.\n\nOn top of this, the company has introduced its own AI models, such as Llama, which is integrated into its apps and made available to external developers. This positions it as a significant player in the AI ecosystem, which allows control over its development and application across its platforms.\n\nThe impact of these advancements is evident in Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) financial performance.

        "title": "The biggest challenge for Nvidia stock in one chart",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) growth metrics aren't impressing Wall Street like they used to.\n\nNvidia reported earnings on Wednesday which showed the company's earnings and revenue grew more than 100% from the prior year. But it also marked the company's slowest year-over-year revenue growth, 122%, in a year, and the rate of growth compared to the prior year was less than half what Nvidia reported in the first two calendar quarters of 2024.\n\nShares were down as much as 3.5% early Thursday morning.\n\nAnd this growth slowdown, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, is the chief concern with the stock right now and why he maintains a Neutral rating on the AI juggernaut.\n\n\"Next year we're going to have, at the very least, decelerating growth and possibly at some point, revenue declines,\" Luria said.\n\n\"Where if you look at consensus estimates, sell-side estimates, they are for the growth to continue at very, very high rates that are very hard to justify considering Nvidia's revenue is these other companies margins.\"\n\nAt some point, Luria argued, the big tech hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are going to slow their spending. And given they represent the lion's share of Nvidia's current AI chip sales, that'd likely be a headwind to future revenue growth.\n\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" Luria said.\n\nNvidia's earnings call was still rather upbeat. CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for the AI leader's new Blackwell chip as \"incredible.\" And plenty of Wall Street analysts remained bullish on the stock as fears about delays on the Blackwell chip were somewhat eased during the earnings call.\n\nBut for investors assessing a stock that has rallied more than 1000% since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, slowing growth appears to be a sticking point. As Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note to clients, Nvidia's guidance for current quarter revenue of $32.5 billion — plus or minus 2% — appeared to be \"good but not good enough.\"\n\nNvidia's results also didn't surprise Wall Street at the same pace that they had been.\n\nThe company posted its slimmest upside surprise to Wall Street's revenue expectations since the start of 2023. Its roughly 5% beat on earnings per share was the narrowest surprise since before the AI revolution kicked off in 2023, too.\n\n\"The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing,\" Carson Group chief markets strategist, Ryan Detrick wrote in reaction to the earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.” A smartphone with a displayed NVIDIA logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares in chip company Nvidia fell in after-hours trading, following second quarter earnings which showed the smallest revenue beat in six quarters.\n\nNvidia was down nearly 7% in pre-market trading, despite the chipmaker reporting second quarter figures that beat expectations on the top and bottom line after the US bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe company, a world leader in chip design and software, reported revenues of $30bn (£22.7bn) in its fiscal second quarter, compared to analysts' forecasts of $28.8bn.\n\nBen Barringer, technology and media analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nvidia has grown to a point where there is little room for error and any sign of slowing or normalisation of growth will have an outsized effect on the share price.”\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks higher as Nvidia shares fall despite record sales\n\n“This being the smallest beat in six quarters, and the fact guidance for gross margins and costs are weaker was enough to get people to hit the sell button in after hours trading.”\n\nTech stocks led US markets lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the highly-anticipated results, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closing 1.1% down.\n\nSalesforce (CRM)\n\nSoftware company Salesforce posted second quarter results after the US market close on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins and earnings.\n\nSalesforce posted net sales of $9.33bn for the second quarter, above an estimate of $9.23bn.\n\nShares popped in after-hours trading, up 5%.\n\nSales increased 11% in Europe, 16% in Asia-Pacific, and 8% in its Americas segment in the second quarter. This marked a turnaround from the previous quarter when the company posted its first sales estimate miss since 2006.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin,” Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also reported an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, coming in above estimates of 31.94%.\n\n“Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history,\" Miner said.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n\nShares in Warren Buffet’s company were trending in pre-market trading as it hit $1tn (£756bn) in market value — the first US company outside of the tech sector to reach the milestone.\n\nThe $1tn threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffet turns 94 years old.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway comprises a $285bn stock portfolio that Buffett has built up over six decades, making him one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn recent months, Berkshire Hathaway has been in selling mode. It cut its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 50% last quarter. On Tuesday, the company disclosed it had sold nearly 25 million Bank of America (BAC) shares worth close to $1bn.\n\nRead more: The top FTSE 100 winners and losers of 2024 so far\n\nBerkshire’s insurance, energy, manufacturing, retail and service businesses generated $22.8bn of profit in the first half of the year, up 26% from a year earlier.\n\nTopping the list of the most valuable companies are Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), which all are worth more than $3tn. Other companies trading above $1tn include Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nShares in the AI server maker were almost 7% lower in pre-market trading after plunging over 19% during Wednesday’s session after it said it would delay the filing of its annual report.\n\n″SMCI is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense,” the company said. “Additional time is needed for SMCI’s management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of 30 June 2024.”\n\nThat announcement came a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report that alleged it found “glaring accounting red flags” and other issues at the company.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said some of Hindenburg’s claims are “tough to verify” and that the report is “largely void of details around alleged wrong doings from the company”.\n\nHindenburg Research said its three-month investigation found \"evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues\". The firm disclosed on Tuesday that it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

(HPQ) printed an earnings miss for its most recent quarter, but it's CEO says the tech giant is poised to put out better results as AI PCs ramp up and the company cuts costs.\n\nCEO Enrique Lores told me on Yahoo Finance the company will be more \"aggressive\" with cost cuts to improve profits, mostly in the printing business. The cost cuts are part of a $1.6 billion plan hatched nearly a year ago.\n\nThe company's fiscal third quarter sales were mixed.\n\nSales of consumer PCs fell 1% in the quarter, while commercial sales improved 8%. Sales for the PC division overall rose 5%.\n\nSimilar to the previous quarter, commercial clients are upgrading their computers ahead of Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.\n\nSecond quarter worldwide shipments of traditional PCs hit 64.9 million, up 3% year over year according to data from IDC. It marked the second quarter of growth following eight straight quarters of declines. China was the lone weak spot, IDC said.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the PC market just like other technology markets faces challenges in the near term due to maturity and headwinds,\" said IDC group vice president of worldwide device trackers Ryan Reith.\n\nWhere HP continues to have challenges is in its printing business amid stiff price competition and shifts in the marketplace, such as more people working from home rather than an office.\n\nPrinting sales dropped 3% year over year. Consumer printing sales increase 2%, while commercial fell 5%.\n\nOperating margins for the printing segment declined to 17.3% from 19% a year ago, and were the main culprit in earnings falling shy of Wall Street estimates.\n\nHP's results follow weak earnings and cautious guidance from printing rival Xerox (XRX).\n\n\"Demand for laser and inkjet printers remain muted (particularly in China + Europe), and that has negative read-throughs to HP’s home printing and supplies business,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani. \"We also note aggressive pricing from peers (taking advantage of a weaker Yen) presents competitive headwinds for HP.\"\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet sales: $13.5 billion (+2.4% year over year) vs. $13.37 billion estimate Personal systems sales: $9.4 billion (+5% year over year) vs. $9.1 billion estimate Printing sales: $4.1 billion (-3% year over year) vs. $4.25 billion estimate Diluted EPS: $0.83 (-3% year over year) vs. $0.86 estimate (guidance: $0.78-$0.92)\n\nWhat else caught our attention\n\nFiscal fourth quarter EPS guidance: $0.89 to $0.99 vs. $0.95 estimate Full-year EPS guidance: $3.35 to $3.45 vs. $3.45 estimate (previous guidance: $3.30 to $3.60)\n\nStory continues\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms is planning a mixed reality device that resembles a bulky pair of glasses, the Information reported on Wednesday, citing two employees from the social media giant.\n\nInternally code-named \"Puffin\", the new project is focused on designing an alternative to the heavy headsets offered by Facebook's parent company, which have a limited consumer appeal, the report added.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.\n\nMixed reality merges augmented and virtual reality and allows real-world and digital objects to interact.\n\nAugmented reality overlays text, sounds, graphics and video onto real-world images that users see in front of them, while virtual reality puts users into a completely artificial environment, creating computer-generated experiences.\n\nPuffin would be a significantly smaller device than Meta's existing Quest headsets, the report said, adding the project is still in early stages with a planned release in 2027.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs division, in charge for developing and marketing the Quest line of VR headsets, has incurred financial losses amounting to billions. Despite this, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the future prospects of augmented and virtual reality technologies.\n\nUnlike Quest headsets, the new Puffin device will not include handheld controllers as users will be able to operate it with hand gestures and eye movements, according to the report.\n\nThe virtual and mixed reality headset market gained renewed attention following Apple's entry last year, although its Vision Pro has faced challenges in sales due to a pricy tag of nearly $3,500.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)",

        "content": "AI Chip Stocks Rally Faces New Headwinds - Why Is Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom, and Marvell Sliding?\n\nSemiconductor and chip stocks, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL), Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX) are trading lower Wednesday ahead of Nvidia’s fiscal second-quarter earnings, reflecting the interconnected semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nThe sell-off also follows key Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) getting called out by Hindenburg for its accounting malpractices, related party transactions, and more, leading to a delayed annual report filing. Super Micro stock is down close to 27%.\n\nNvidia’s second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenue guidance of $27.44 billion-$28.56 billion is a big jump from its second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue of $13.51 billion, which bears testimony to the continued artificial intelligence tailwind for the stock. The stock is up over 172% in the last 12 months.\n\nJPMorgan’s Harlan Sur expects Broadcom to be worthy of a $150 billion-plus AI semiconductor opportunity over the next five years after it bagged ChatGPT parent OpenAI and a major AI ASIC customer.\n\nThe analyst backed his projections with Broadcom’s plans to ramp Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen 3nm TPU AI processor and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) being an essential partner of Broadcom. Broadcom stock is up 87% in the last 12 months.\n\nSur had earlier called out Broadcom’s 80% market share in the $5 billion-$7 billion datacenter/AI Ethernet switching and routing chipset market, which places it ahead of Nvidia and Marvell Technology.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key Nvidia supplier and also leads the global foundry market with a 62% share as of the second quarter of 2024. It guided third-quarter revenue of $22.4 billion—$23.3 billion, up from the $17.3 billion reported a year ago, backed by robust demand for AI chied in hyper-performance computing and smartphones.\n\nThe contract chipmaker looks to boost prices of its 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer process products to maintain its margin goals. Taiwan Semiconductor stock is up over 80% in the last 12 months.\n\nAI server company Super Micro is another beneficiary of the AI wave. It expects first-quarter revenue of $6 billion—$7 billion, compared to the $2.12 billion revenue it reported a year ago. The stock has increased over 61% in the last 12 months, backed by AI server demand from Big Tech giants.\n\nMarvell Technology expects second-quarter revenue of $1.19 billion—$1.31 billion versus the $1.34 billion it reported a year ago, driven by ramping custom AI silicon for data centers, enterprise networking, and carrier infrastructure. The stock has risen over 24% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nLam Research expects first-quarter revenue of $3.75 billion—$4.35 billion, up from the $3.48 billion it reported a year ago. Thanks to the demand for AI-powered chips, the company is looking to tap the wafer fab equipment spending. The stock has risen over 20% in the last 12 months.\n\nPrice Actions: TSM stock is down 2.07% at $167.01 at the last check on Wednesday.

        "content": "By Victor Pinheiro\n\nSÃO PAULO - Meta Platforms faces a fine of up to $3.62 million after losing a lawsuit by Brazilian department store chain Havan that accused the social media company of accepting paid advertisements that fraudulently use the retailer's name to deceive consumers.\n\nA Santa Catarina state judge ruled on Monday that Meta had 48 hours to block ads that Havan did not contract and which mention it or its owner, billionaire Luciano Hang. If Meta does not comply, fines can go up to 20 million reais.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Joana Ribeiro said it was unacceptable for Meta to sell ads in an insecure way to sustain its business model.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Havan called the decision \"a landmark\" in protecting the company's and Hang's rights.\n\nMeta declined to comment. The company can appeal the decision.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Havan said Meta profits from illicit ads without taking responsibility or verifying their legitimacy, leading fraud victims to sue the retailer.\n\nEarlier this year, Reuters' fact-checking service in Brazil verified three false Havan ads on Meta platforms that used Hang's image. All showed signs of artificial intelligence being used to imitate the businessman's voice.\n\nThe fraudulent ads led victims to pay for nonexistent products.\n\n($1 = 5.5209 reais)\n\n(Writing by Bernardo Barbosa; Editing by Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg’s push for efficiency is upending Meta’s ambitions in augmented reality",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency” at Meta—a cost-cutting drive that began in February 2023 with the likely goal of diverting resources to AI's costly needs—keeps getting extended. And it seems to be having a major effect on the company’s augmented reality efforts.\n\nMeta is widely expected to show off a prototype of its first AR glasses, codenamed Orion, next month. (Meta already makes “smart glasses” with EssilorLuxottica that don’t overlay any digital information on the lens, and it makes relatively bulky Quest headsets that offer “mixed reality” AR/VR features on their screens. Orion would presumably fit somewhere in-between these offerings.)\n\nBut Fortune’s Kali Hays reported yesterday that the device won’t be powered by custom chips, as was originally planned. This in-house development effort was killed off last year, meaning Orion and its successors will run on Qualcomm silicon. It remains to be seen how much of an effect forgoing custom chips will have on performance and power efficiency.\n\nAs Kali reported: “Amid mass layoffs and cost-cutting efforts throughout the company, work on custom chips was deemed too expensive, and the need for the chips too far removed from current business priorities.”\n\nBut that’s not all. Yesterday, Meta announced it will kill off the “Spark” toolset that third-party developers have for years used to easily create AR effects for Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger—and even for exhibitions and art installations, via a desktop application.\n\nMeta’s own Spark AR effects for its stable of apps will survive, but, less than five months from now, bang goes all the work that brands and individual creators have done on the platform over the last eight years.\n\nNow’s a good time to revisit the heartwarming videos about the Spark ecosystem that Meta once published, such as this one about how a creator found purpose in making scary clown-face overlays for U2 singer Bono. People built businesses around making and even selling Spark AR effects, but all those filters and 3D objects will be deleted along with the Spark platform. (Videos that already feature the effects won't be impacted.)\n\n“This decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,” Meta said in a statement that set Jan. 14 next year as the termination date for third-party Spark effects. A separate Q&A says Meta will “prioritize investments in other company priorities,” which is about as vague as you can get.\n\nSpark effect creators, unsurprisingly, are pretty furious.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s a huge disrespect to us and also to the Facebook/Instagram users,” TechCrunch quotes one creator, Douglas Costa, as saying. “Five months to end development? It should be at least a year so that we creators can have a better opportunity to build a new portfolio or find a new job.”\n\nSo it will be interesting to see not only the hardware that Meta reveals next month, but also whether the company is still interested in having any kind of third-party developer ecosystem around its AR platform. If so, it will have some convincing to do. But maybe effect development will just turn out to be another job for AI.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe AI-led rally in the stock market is expected to ripple through other sectors and smaller tech companies, but analysts believe for now large-cap companies are still the key focus of money managers. Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is “too narrow.”\n\n“Historically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a “higher-for-longer” rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,” the firm said.\n\nThe latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.  Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT? that they remain more optimistic about AI’s economic potential even if we don’t see immediate benefits for now.\n\nHedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That’s why it’s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Hedge Funds Buying and Selling Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) AI Stock?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q2: 219\n\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q1: 246\n\nBillionaire David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management slashed its Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stake to 935K shares during the second quarter from 1.12M shares.\n\n3G Capital Partners of Brazilian billionaires Brazilian billionaires Alexandre Behring and Jorge Paulo Lemann cut its stake in Meta Platforms by about 28% in the second quarter to $34,034,850.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Analyst Says Meta Platforms (META) AI Monetization is Growing Rapidly",
        "content": "We recently published a list of  Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang’s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it’s going to be a “difficult week” for major tech companies.\n\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\n“I still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,” Munster said.\n\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\n“There is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it’s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.”\n\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Among Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\n\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, recently talked about how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) was able to spur revenue growth because of AI during a program on CNBC.\n\n“If you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that’s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "Many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Meta Platforms\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, sold US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$519). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\n\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Meta Platforms better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, insiders sold US$3.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Meta Platforms\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$180b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Meta Platforms Insiders?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Meta Platforms.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia",
        "content": "After propelling markets to record highs in the first half of 2024, the mega cap tech companies that have dominated Wall Street are now grappling with the aftermath of a global selloff that has wiped nearly $1tn (£755bn) off their combined market value.\n\nThe so-called “Magnificent Seven” — a term inspired by the classic Western film and popularised on Wall Street — includes tech behemoths Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). These companies were instrumental in driving the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains last year, with a Morgan Stanley report highlighting that these seven companies alone accounted for half of the index's total return.\n\nThe combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven exceeds that of the entire stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China, and Canada combined. However, this group has recently encountered significant setbacks. Six of the seven companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, and the results have fallen short of the lofty expectations set by investors.\n\nTesla, for instance, saw its earnings plummet by more than 40%, despite surpassing sales forecasts. Amazon’s share price plunged 11% following its earnings announcement. Growing concerns about the health of the US economy also fuelled a wave of selling across global markets.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\n\"Coming into this earnings season, the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were up against almost impossible expectations of beating perfection,\" Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBiz Investment Advisory Services, said. \"So in some ways, it's not surprising to see some sell-off here.\"\n\nThere are also cases where the Mag 7 are just too expensive. Nvidia's valuation surged to such heights that it became out of reach for many value investors. Back in July the company decided to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split, when it was trading at around $1,210, to make its stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. It is now trading at around $120 as the countdown continues to its earnings.\n\nThe $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks when it reports later on Wednesday, serving as a bellwether for AI spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.\n\nAs the AI rally enters a crucial stage, investors are left to consider where to look for alternatives to diversify their portfolio or undervalued stocks that might benefit from artificial intelligence. Here are some companies to have on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nFive alternatives to the Magnificent Seven ASML makes lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nThe AI rally has been driven by the need for the world’s most advanced chips. Dutch company ASML manufactures lithography machines essential for producing them.\n\nWhile not a household name, ASML should be on any investor’s radar who is looking to capitalise on the growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nASML is virtually the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. Its clients include semiconductor giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (005930.KS).\n\nWhen ASML published its quarterly results in July, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “ASML is further proof that the AI boom still has legs. Demand is soaring for the semiconductor equipment maker.”\n\nDespite a recent share price pullback, the current price of around $920 is more than 20% below analysts' consensus target of $1,194, and the vast majority of analysts still consider the stock a strong buy.\n\n“Companies across countless industries are investing heavily in AI, which means chipmakers have the confidence to build more manufacturing plants,” Coatsworth added. “That feeds into greater demand for ASML’s equipment, which plays a crucial role in the production of computer chips.”\n\nHowever, weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance has negatively impacted the stock. Nearly half of ASML’s sales still come from China, making geopolitical risk a significant concern for investors.\n\nRead more: How likely are multiple Bank of England interest rate cuts this year?\n\nASML is also part of the \"Granolas\" — a group of \"internationally-exposed quality growth compounders\" and Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven, according to Goldman Sachs. So named for the combined first initials, which spell Grannnllass, the eleven companies are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche (ROG.SW), ASML, Nestle (NESN.SW), Novartis (NOVN.SW), Novo Nordisk (NVO), L'Oreal (OR.PA), LVMH (MC.PA), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), SAP (SAP) and Sanofi (SNY).\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) The weight loss drug has proven to be a success with celebrities. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNovo Nordisk, another member of the Granolas, is currently Europe’s largest company by market capitalisation and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, is not exposed to the tech sector. This could be an attractive option for those who believe that AI is a bubble or simply want diversification.\n\nThe Danish firm makes the weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, which have gained widespread popularity, including among celebrities such as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and TV personality Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSam North, market analyst at eToro, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"Novo Nordisk emerges as a standout option in Europe. The Danish pharmaceutical giant has gone from strength to strength over the last few years and is currently the largest stock in Europe by market capitalisation.\n\n“Analysts are optimistic about Novo Nordisk's performance, particularly with its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. The company reportedly sold 10.4bn Danish kroner (£1.2bn) worth of Wegovy in the first quarter alone, more than doubling its sales from the same period last year.\"\n\nHe added: “From a technical analysis standpoint, there are a couple of levels that I think act as a good guide of sentiment for the bulls to focus on. The 740 DKK level offers a potential entry point for those looking to buy on dips, while a move above 928 DKK could signal a push towards its previous all-time high. In an environment where timing the market is challenging, Novo Nordisk stands out as a resilient and promising addition to any portfolio.”\n\nNovo Nordisk’s shares have surged around 260% since launching Wegovy in the United States in June 2021. The company’s market value of £455bn now exceeds the size of the entire Danish economy.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) The group that owns the Louis Vuitton brand has show resilience in the consumer discretionary segment.. (Pablo Cuadra via Getty Images)\n\nThough LVMH has lost its crown as Europe’s largest company to Novo Nordisk, it remains a heavyweight contender.\n\nDespite challenges in the consumer discretionary sector, LVMH has continued to deliver strong profits, with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels. This translated into €10.7bn (£9.02bn/$12bn) in operating profit. Additionally, its free cash flow increased by 74% to €3.13bn, or 7.5% of revenue.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on slowing growth and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22:2.\n\nLVMH's diversified conglomerate model, which includes brands like Tiffany, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora, allows it to tap into different luxury segments.\n\nGrowth is also likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall globally.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)  Snowflake chairman and CEO Frank Slootman gifts a snowboard to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nReturning to the US and the tech sector, Snowflake is well-positioned to benefit from the AI rally. Snowflake’s CEO Frank Slootman said: “There is no AI strategy without a data strategy.”\n\nThe company focuses on data management services, collecting and analysing an organisation’s data to deliver insights that help businesses grow. The rise of AI has made this data even more valuable.\n\nThe demand for Snowflake’s data management platform has driven strong revenue growth. In its 2024 fiscal year, Snowflake achieved $2.8bn in sales, up 36% from the prior year’s $2.1bn. The company expects its revenue to continue expanding, estimating $3.3bn in sales for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, analysts remain cautious, which could mean the share is currently undervalued.\n\n“Waning optimisation headwinds and emerging new product initiatives should support growth, but investors may need more concrete signals to get on board,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a report.\n\nSeven analysts have a \"strong buy\" recommendation for Snowflake’s shares, and 24 rate it as a \"buy\", according to Yahoo Finance data. The market consensus sees the share price trading at $166, higher than the current $118, with $220 as the high range for the stock.\n\nRolls Royce (RR.L) Rolls Royce has surprised investors under new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIt is not part of the Magnificent Seven, it does not list under Europe’s Granola’s and it is part of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which Nvidia alone has overtaken in value. So how can Rolls Royce be a Mag 7 alternative?\n\nThe company has delivered a total shareholder return of 221% over the past year, matching Nvidia's performance. This surprise achievement reflects growing investor confidence in the turnaround plan laid out by new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic.\n\nHis vision for Rolls-Royce is ambitious, aiming to transform the company into a leaner, more profitable enterprise with a bright future. Erginbilgic’s has set out to achieve a dramatic increase in adjusted operating profits from about £250m to between £2.5bn and £2.8bn by 2027.\n\nThis growth is underpinned by a strategy to unlock £2bn in working capital savings, primarily through better inventory management. These efficiencies are expected to help the company boost free cash flow from £500m to between £2.8bn and £3.1bn over the next five years.\n\nSince Erginbilgic joined, shares have more than quadrupled to top London’s premier index. That rally is made all the more remarkable given the struggles that gripped Rolls-Royce in the years prior, which included a very close brush with bankruptcy during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest turnaround is expected to happen at the civil aviation business, which accounts for nearly half of group sales. The rest of its revenues are split relative evenly between Rolls-Royce’s defence and power systems divisions.\n\nErginbilgic believes civil aviation’s adjusted operating margins can be lifted from 2.5% to between 14.5% and 16.5% by 2027. While the improvement looks dramatic, these levels of profitability are comparable to those of some rivals.\n\nThe current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Rolls-Royce stands at 18. While some investors may argue that this valuation isn't cheap, it's also not particularly expensive for a blue-chip company within the FTSE 100.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Meta has abandoned efforts to make custom chips for its upcoming AR glasses",
        "content": "Ambitious efforts inside Meta to build its own custom chips for use in an expanding line of wearable consumer devices fell victim to ongoing efforts to rein in company costs.\n\nLast year, while Meta was still deep into what CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg dubbed his “year of efficiency,” years of work on the in-house development of computer chips crucial to a planned line of wearable glasses effectively came to an end. Amid mass layoffs and cost-cutting efforts throughout the company, work on custom chips was deemed too expensive, and the need for the chips too far removed from current business priorities, two people familiar with the company and the changes told Fortune.\n\nInstead of designing its own chips for smart glasses , Meta has shifted gears and opted to rely on third-party chipmakers like Qualcomm for its upcoming prototypes and potential future versions of the AR glasses, one of the sources said.\n\nWhile Meta continues to design other types of chips, such as specialized processors to run AI workloads in its data centers, the company's pullback from custom chips for wearables marks the end of an ambitious project that began in 2019. The chips were set to be the backbone of the wearable gadgets they were being developed for, mainly a line of augmented reality glasses codenamed Orion. An “experimental” prototype of the Orion AR glasses is still set to be revealed by Meta sometime this year, likely in the coming weeks, possibly in September at Meta's Connect event for developers, one of the people said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\n\nSilicon to power Zuckerberg's vision\n\nSmart glasses and virtual reality headsets are at the center of Zuckerberg's vision for the future of computing. The CEO recently predicted that AR and AI enabled glasses will be used by hundreds of millions of people in the near future.\n\nWhile Meta generates the overwhelming majority of its revenue from advertising on its various social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, the company has spent tens of billions of dollars building a consumer hardware business. The group, known as Reality Labs, generated a relatively scant $353 million in revenue and an operating loss of $4.5 billion in the most recently ended quarter.\n\nMeta currently sells a line of Ray-Ban smart glasses through a partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. The current version incorporates a camera and a chip that connects to a person's phone, but does not include AR capabilities, which would overlay digital information directly on the lens.\n\nWhen the Orion project was in its early stages, custom chips were thought necessary to get the kind of performance Zuckerberg ultimately wanted. The custom chips were intended for the Orion glasses, as well as a next-gen version of the AR glasses being developed, under the project name Apollo, the person familiar added. Meta at one point also considered using a custom chip for its popular Quest virtual reality headset, but that idea was killed early on, as was a custom chip for a planned smart-watch that was nixed in its entirety. The custom chips were intended for the Apollo version of the glasses as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe design work on the chips for wearables was done by the Silicon team within Meta’s hardware division. The team was actually developing three separate chips for AR glasses: one for the “puck,” a non-wearable processor portion of the glasses; one within the glasses, mainly needed for image recognition; and another processor within the glasses, the sources told Fortune. The individual project names for the chips were Armstrong, Avogadro and Acropolis, respectively, one of the people familiar said. There were plans to develop a line of smaller chips, like Power Management Integrated Circuits, or PMICs, that have also been abandoned, the person added.\n\nWhile it’s possible that some of the custom work done over the previous years will be useful for future wearables projects, or lead to Meta using semi-custom chips, the company for now has switched to relying on “off the shelf” XR chips from Qualcomm, one of the people familiar said. Qualcomm also provides the VR chips used in Meta’s Quest headsets.\n\nAs for the employees behind this work, scores of Meta employees from the Silicon team have been laid off since October. Cuts to the team were first reported by Reuters.

It was first launched to compete with photo-sharing app Snapchat, which became popular for its image filters. The studio will shut down on Jan. 14, 2025, the company said Tuesday in a statement, though Meta will still offer AR effects that it created in-house.\n\n“After thorough consideration, it was determined that Meta will prioritize investments in other company priorities,” the company wrote in an accompanying post. “With the decision to shut down the Meta Spark platform, we’re also shifting resources to the next generation of experiences, across new form factors like glasses.”\n\nThe company lost about $50 billion on augmented and virtual reality products through January of this year. So far, its efforts to sell virtual and augmented reality devices, including headsets, have faltered.\n\nMore recently, Meta’s focus has shifted to artificial intelligence.

        "title": "How Zuckerberg censored Covid on Facebook",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg admits Facebook's Covid censorship\n\nTensions with Facebook had been brewing for months before Joe Biden brought the row into the open three years ago.\n\nIn Britain and America, government departments had privately put pressure on Mark Zuckerberg’s social media giant to limit the spread of anti-vaccine posts or messages questioning Covid’s origins.\n\nThen in July 2021, the US president went public.\n\n“They’re killing people,” Mr Biden told reporters when asked about the spread of anti-vax messages, before repeating the claim for emphasis. “The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they’re killing people.”\n\nMr Biden’s comments, which he later backtracked on, marked a low point for relations between Facebook and the White House. In a group WhatsApp chat between Mr Zuckerberg and other top executives, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, vented.\n\n“Ugh on Biden today,” Ms Sandberg wrote, according to messages recently released by a Republican-controlled US House committee. “I think they are scapegoating us to cover their own missed vaccination rates and a virus they can’t get control of.”\n\nSir Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister and Facebook’s lobbying chief, wrote: “The behaviour of the [White House] over the last 24 hours has been highly cynical and dishonest.” Facebook lobbying chief Sir Nick Clegg was among those berated by the White House over the company's cooperation - Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg\n\nMs Sandberg – an avowed Democrat – even compared the Biden administration’s actions unfavourably to Trump’s White House.\n\n“Did Trump say things this irresponsible? If Trump blamed a private company, not himself and his government, everyone would have gone nuts,” she wrote.\n\nThe frustration was understandable. White House officials had berated Facebook executives, including Sir Nick, about what they saw as the company’s failure to cooperate with the Biden administration’s Covid response. But Facebook claimed it did regularly cooperate.\n\nIn one case it demoted a video of the Fox News host Tucker Carlson questioning the effectiveness of vaccines after an angry email from Rob Flaherty, White House digital strategy director, despite the video not breaking Facebook’s rules.\n\nLater, staff brainstormed what more they could do to crack down on Covid posts, citing “the continued criticism of our approach from the US administration”.\n\nIn one case, Sir Nick refused to take down a meme featuring Leonardo DiCaprio joking that in 10 years those who had taken the vaccine could be entitled to compensation.\n\nSir Nick said that Andy Slavitt, the White House’s senior Covid-19 adviser, was “outraged” that the joke post was not removed.\n\nWhile less forthright, British politicians also put pressure on Facebook to toe the line.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Telegraph’s Lockdown Files investigation revealed that Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, sent Sir Nick a WhatsApp saying: “Your team have been working really well with the department and the advertising ban is great – but we need to have a timeframe for removal of anti-vax material and how to demonetise.”\n\nSir Nick wrote back, “I’ll look into this”, before responding a month later by saying Facebook would delete posts making false claims about vaccines.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s secretive Counter Disinformation Unit was busy monitoring posts critical of lockdowns or vaccine passports. Through the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, it enjoyed “trusted flagger” status that allowed requests for content removals to be fast-tracked. Former health secretary Matt Hancock sent Sir Nick a WhatsApp requesting a 'timeframe for removal of anti-vax material' during the pandemic - Jonathan Brady/PA Wire\n\nDespite some resistance, emails and documents revealed in lawsuits and investigations show that Facebook’s team bowed to White House pressure to take a hard line on Covid posts.\n\nThis included removing claims that Covid-19 was man-made or posts comparing it to the flu. One employee told Sir Nick these actions were taken “because we were under pressure … to do more”.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Zuckerberg admitted he wished he had fought censorship.\n\nIn a letter to Jim Jordan, US Republican, he said: “Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including Covid-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure.\n\n“I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.”\n\nIn truth, Facebook’s boss had been angry at the Biden White House for some time. In 2021 he wrote a WhatsApp message to fellow executives saying: “If they’re more interested in criticising us than actually solving the problems, then I’m not sure how it’s helping the cause to engage with them further.”\n\nBut Mr Zuckerberg knew he had to tread carefully. Months earlier, the US government had sued Meta, Facebook’s parent company, in an anti-monopoly case that could see the company broken up (the lawsuit is yet to go to trial). It later attempted to block the company’s takeover of virtual reality company Within.\n\nSir Nick told executives that Facebook should attempt to be “responsive” to the White House’s concerns “given the bigger fish we have to fry with the [Biden] administration”.\n\nToday, the Facebook founder is in less of a mood to be compliant. Elon Musk's vociferous attacks on attempts to regulate free speech have made Mr Zuckerberg appear to some as the lesser of two evils - REUTERS/David Swanson\n\nPublic pressure on social media companies to enthusiastically moderate their sites has waned after the chaos of the Covid years. Meta sacked hundreds of moderators last year amid widespread brutal layoffs.\n\nThe company has also been given plenty of cover by Elon Musk. The billionaire’s purchase of Twitter and vociferous attacks on attempts to regulate free speech have made Mr Zuckerberg, in some people’s eyes, the lesser of two evils.\n\nMeta has also had a string of legal successes. It has delayed or been victorious in the US government’s legal cases against it. And last year, a US judge banned federal agencies from contacting social media companies to demand that they take down certain posts.\n\nThe ruling was overturned in the Supreme Court, but is likely to have made officials think twice the next time they see something they don’t like on Facebook.\n\nIn one email in 2021, Mr Zuckerberg told Sir Nick: “This seems like a good reminder that when we compromise our standards due to pressure from an administration in either direction, we’ll often regret it later.”\n\nHe now seems to have taken that reminder to heart.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed in a letter that the Biden administration had pressured the company to \"censor\" COVID-19 content during the pandemic, apparently referring to White House requests to take down misinformation.\n\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" states the letter to Jim Jordan, the head of the US House of Representatives judiciary committee. It is dated August 26, 2024.\n\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong,\" adds Zuckerberg, adding that he regrets not being more outspoken about it.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Facebook implemented misinformation alerts for users who commented on or liked posts that were judged to contain false Covid information.\n\nIn addition, posts criticizing Covid vaccines were also deleted. In the 2020 US presidential election campaign, President Biden said social media platforms were \"killing people\" for allowing what they deemed as misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on the platforms.\n\n\"I think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today,\" added Zuckerberg. \"I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction. And we are ready to push back if something like this happens again.\"\n\nZuckerberg also went on to state that the FBI previously warned Meta about a potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family in the lead-up to the 2020 election. The story was demoted on Meta's social media platforms.\n\nHowever, it has since been made clear that the reporting was not Russian disinformation. \"In retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story,\" said Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" concluded the Meta CEO.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\n\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm has taken a different approach than other tech giants when it comes to AI, choosing to open source the large language model it has developed, unlike Google and Microsoft. This is largely because the firm plans to use the generative AI potential to enhance the advertisement market. Meta just recently overtook Google in digital ad market share and now plans to beat Amazon in the ad domain as well. Under this plan, the firm is also investing heavily in AI infrastructure build.\n\nThis aggressive AI strategy has caught the attention of market experts on Wall Street. Investment advisory Tigress Financial has a Strong Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). In a recent investor note, the advisory highlighted that the cash flow of the tech giant was enabling ongoing investments in artificial intelligence initiatives that would drive user engagement, better content, and a more effective advertising experience.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.14 per share, indicating a change of +17.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.2%. This estimate has changed +5.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.07 indicates a change of +13% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.8%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.62 billion and $184.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.8% and +13.9%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If you don't own Nvidia stock you are missing a revolution, says tech investor",
        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIt still makes a lot of sense to own momentum stock darling Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n“If you don’t own Nvidia, you are literally missing out on a revolution,” Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (watch video above; listen in here).\n\nGerber opined those not investing in Nvidia are comparable to people “not investing in Napoleon during the French Revolution.”\n\nGerber says his firm has owned Nvidia's stock for over a decade.\n\nInitially, Nvidia’s strong position in gaming chips was the draw. But as Nvidia has pivoted to autonomous car chips and powerful AI chips, Gerber has been gobbling up more shares of the Jensen Huang-led tech play.\n\n“It’s been the best investment we’ve ever made,” Gerber added.\n\nThe firm’s longtime bullishness appears to have paid off handsomely. Recently, shares have skyrocketed with plenty of upside.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged more than 2,900% in the past five years, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabs the leadership position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong results continued in its first fiscal quarter, with sales rising 18% year over year to $26 billion. Non-GAAP earnings boomed 461% from the prior year.\n\nWhen Nvidia reports its closely watched second quarter results on Wednesday afternoon, the Street is looking for more of the same. Revenue and earnings are expected to rise 113% and 156%, respectively.\n\nGerber isn’t alone in his optimism on Nvidia.\n\nIn a June visit to the Opening Bid podcast, EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson told Sozzi he believed the company could hit a $6 trillion market cap, nearly double its then-$3.25 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia's current market cap stands at about $3.18 trillion.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia ahead of earnings.\n\nConcerns such as delays in next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture are potential short-term woes, said Hari in a note to clients.\n\n\"Overall, we expect management commentary coupled with supply chain data points over the coming weeks to lead to higher conviction as it pertains to Nvidia’s earnings power in calendar 2025,” wrote Hari in a note.\n\nHari noted that significant customers, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), have unveiled plans to increase capital spending, and Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are allocating capital expenditure growth toward AI and cloud products.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Intra-quarter data points continued to indicate a robust demand environment,” wrote Hari.\n\nThis past week, Nvidia's rival AMD (AMD) announced the $4.9 billion acquisition of server equipment maker ZT Systems. To Nvidia bulls, the deal underscored how much the company is outpacing a worthy competitor such as AMD, led by Lisa Su.\n\n“We’re long-term investors,” Gerber said. “I think Nvidia should be a core holding, with Microsoft, for sure.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Zuckerberg says the White House pressured Facebook over some COVID-19 content during the pandemic",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to “censor” some COVID-19 content during the pandemic and vowed that the social media giant would push back if it faced such demands again.\n\nIn a letter to Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleges that the officials, including those from the White House, “repeatedly pressured” Facebook for months to take down “certain COVID-19 content including humor and satire.”\n\nThe officials “expressed a lot of frustration” when the company didn't agree, he said in the letter.\n\n“I believe the government pressure was wrong and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,” Zuckerberg wrote in the letter dated Aug. 26 and posted on the committee's Facebook page and to its account on X.\n\nThe letter is the latest repudiation by Zuckerberg of efforts to target misinformation around the coronavirus pandemic during and after the 2020 presidential election, particularly as allegations have emerged that some posts were deleted or restricted wrongly.\n\n“I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn’t make today,” he said, without elaborating. “We’re ready to push back if something like this happens again.”\n\nIn response, the White House said in a statement that, “When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this Administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety. Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.”\n\nExperts warn this year's U.S. election could be swamped by misinformation on social media with the proliferation of artificial intelligence and other tools to produce false news stories and content that could mislead voters.\n\nFacebook in early 2021 appended what Zuckerberg called labels with “credible information” to posts about COVID-19 vaccines. That’s after it moved in April 2020 — just as the virus had led to global shutdowns and radical changes in everyday life — to warn users who shared misinformation about COVID-19.\n\nConservatives have long derided Facebook and other major tech companies as favoring liberal priorities and accused them of censorship.\n\nZuckerberg has tried to change the company’s perception on the right, going on podcaster Joe Rogan’s show in 2022 and complimenting Republican nominee Donald Trump’s response to an assassination attempt as “badass.” He sent Monday’s letter to the House Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Jordan, is a longtime Trump ally.\n\nStory continues\n\nZuckerberg also said he would no longer donate money to widen election access for voters through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the company that runs the philanthropy for him and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nThe couple previously donated $400 million to help local election offices prepare for voters in the 2020 presidential election, with funds used for protective equipment to prevent the spread of the coronavirus at polling sites, drive-thru voting locations and equipment to process mail ballots.\n\n“I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other” despite analyses showing otherwise, he said. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don’t plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.”\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Zuckerberg blasts Biden administration for pressuring Meta to censor COVID content",
        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has washed his hands of this year's U.S. presidential elections—and has vowed not to accommodate any demands from current or future administrations.\n\nA letter written by the Facebook founder to Republican representative Jim Jordan alleges White House representatives \"repeatedly pressured\" Meta into censoring COVID content and \"expressed a lot of frustration\" when the Meta team would not comply.\n\nThe letter, dated August 26, was shared on official Xpage of the House Judiciary GOP which is chaired by Rep. Jordan.\n\nIn the letter Zuckerberg, who has amassed a fortune worth $185 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, says he regrets cowing to the alleged pressure from the Biden administration during the pandemic.\n\nThe entrepreneur wrote: \"Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure.\n\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.\n\n\"I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment but has issued a statement on how it approached online content relating to coronavirus.\n\n“When confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety,” a spokesman told Politico. “Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.”\n\nAmid fears of a \"tsunami of misinformation\" ahead of the November elections, Zuckerberg is digging his heels in against any political pressure to come.\n\nHe added: \"I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction—and we're ready to push back if something like this happens again.\"\n\nOverall Zuckerberg's letter seeks to disentangle both Meta—which is currently being investigated by the European Commission over claims it is failing to adequately tackle disinformation—and himself from politics.\n\nAt the end of the letter Zuckerberg adds: \"I want to address the contributions I made during the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure. The idea here was to make sure local election jurisdictions across the country had the resources they needed to help people vote safely during a global pandemic.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe contributions were made through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative—a philanthropic body co-founded and led by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan—totalling more than $400 million.\n\nAt the time critics—including former President Trump—baselessly claimed the funds were being used to get Democratic nominee President Biden elected.\n\nIndeed a study from UCLA published in May discovered the funds donated by the billionaire—nicknamed \"Zuckerbucks\" by critics—\"did not substantially improve the performance of Democratic candidates.\"\n\nThe contributions were designed to be non-partisan and spread across a range of urban and rural communities, Zuckerberg said.\n\nHe continued: \"Still, despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\"\n\nMark Zuckerberg just admitted three things:\n\n1. Biden-Harris Admin \"pressured\" Facebook to censor Americans.\n\n2. Facebook censored Americans.\n\n3. Facebook throttled the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nBig win for free speech. pic.twitter.com/ALlbZd9l6K\n\n— House Judiciary GOP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 (@JudiciaryGOP) August 26, 2024\n\nFact-check delays\n\nIn the letter, Zuckerberg also confirms Meta has axed a policy of demoting stories until fact-checkers can confirm they are accurate.\n\nThe decision was taken after Meta was approached by the FBI, Zuckerberg writes, \"about a potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family and Burisma in the lead up to the 2020 election.\"\n\nZuckerberg explains: \"That fall, when we saw a New York Post story reporting on corruption allegations involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's family, we sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Zuckerberg adds, \"we shouldn't have demoted the story\" and as such \"we've changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nThe letter and information in Zuckerberg's letter has been lauded by the GOP. Despite the evidence that Zuckerberg's donations made no difference to the outcome of the election, the House Judiciary GOP wrote on Elon Musk-owned X: \"No more Zuck-bucks. Huge win for election integrity.\"\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia in 3 Years",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming demand for anything related to artificial intelligence (AI). The company's GPUs are valuable equipment used to train large language models, which provide the backbone for generative AI. Big tech companies and cloud providers are snatching up as many Nvidia chips as they can get their hands on.\n\nThe results have been nothing short of phenomenal for Nvidia. Over the last two years, Nvidia has seen its market cap climb from about $424 billion to $3.1 trillion. It's currently sitting right above Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world behind only Apple.\n\nWhile Nvidia gets a lot of attention, it's important to remember it's not the only AI stock you can invest in. There are dozens of other great companies participating in the growth of AI. And the long-term prospects for some of them are even better than Nvidia's. That's why I predict these three companies could end up passing Nvidia's value over the next three years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is one of Nvidia's largest customers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently committed to accumulating 350,000 of the chipmaker's H100 GPUs by the end of this year. The company's capital expenditures, which management expects to come in between $37 billion and $40 billion this year, are rivaled only by the big public cloud companies like Microsoft and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And management expects Meta capex to keep climbing in 2025.\n\nThose massive investments won't pay off directly for some time, but Meta is positioned better than just about any other company to integrate AI capabilities into its products. It sees opportunities to improve the advertising business, grow its business messaging service (with custom AI chatbots), build the most popular consumer-facing AI assistant, and increase engagement across Facebook, Instagram, and its messaging apps.\n\nThat should lead to strong revenue and earnings growth over the long run, even with a step up in depreciation expenses from the increased investments in data centers. Importantly, the growth in spending will slow down over time, as Meta determines exactly how much data center capacity it needs for training and using its generative AI developments.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a forward PE around 26, which is reasonable for a company with its growth prospects. But Meta could outperform earnings estimates if its generative AI features increase ad prices and engagement on Facebook and Instagram and open the door for new revenue opportunities through business messaging and AI assistant interactions. With a market cap of about $1.35 trillion, it could find itself quickly growing to surpass Nvidia over the next three years if one of its AI efforts starts showing very good results.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, is the largest chip manufacturer in the world. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it contracts with TSMC to produce that chip.\n\nTSMC's biggest advantage is its scale. It takes in over 60% of all spending on chip manufacturing. That gives it more money to reinvest in building its capabilities to produce faster, more powerful, and more power-efficient chips. With its cutting-edge design capabilities, it's able to maintain a dominant market share, since chip designers can't get the same results from anyone else.\n\nTSMC's relatively agnostic to who designs the chips. It can make an Nvidia chip just as easily as it can make a custom-designed chip from Meta, Microsoft, or Alphabet. And it does exactly that. That leaves it in a much less precarious position than Nvidia when it comes to the future of AI data center chips.\n\nMany of Nvidia's largest customers have their own chip designs specifically for training and using large language models. These chips aren't as flexible in their usage as Nvidia's, but they're more power-efficient and less expensive to acquire. That makes them increasingly valuable as companies like Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and others dial in and scale their AI development.\n\nIn the meantime, TSMC is able to benefit from the growing spend and increased competition for its limited resources. Its shares trade around 26 times forward earnings, but they arguably deserve a higher multiple as high demand and competition should benefit its bottom line and its earnings are much better protected on the downside. By comparison, Nvidia trades for a forward earnings multiple of 48. The true value for both companies is likely a multiple somewhere in the middle. If TSMC sees multiple expansions and Nvidia sees contraction, TSMC could surpass Nvidia's market cap over time.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is already the fourth-largest company in the world, but its market cap sits about $1 trillion behind Nvidia's. Still, there are good reasons to think the Google owner will increase in value faster than the chipmaker going forward.\n\nAt the core of Alphabet is Google Search. And while it's facing regulatory pressure, it's unlikely to lose the crown as the most popular search engine in the world. That ensures Google remains a key part of marketers' advertising budgets.\n\nImportantly, artificial intelligence assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Meta AI aren't as big of threats as investors once feared. Google has used its own AI, based on its Gemini LLM, to provide direct answers to many search queries, linking to relevant sources. Management says its AI Overviews result in greater search usage and higher user satisfaction. It's also using AI to support new ways to search, including taking videos with your phone or circling content on an app or web page. Both should lead to increased usage.\n\nBut AI has the potential to significantly grow Google's cloud platform, which surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time last quarter. Google is winning many high-profile customers, including Apple, for its AI development platform on Google Cloud. Meanwhile, its Gemini for Workspace software is helping increase its average revenue per user and attract new customers.\n\nAlphabet is certainly spending heavily in order to win those customers.

        "content": "By Gnaneshwar Rajan and Nandita Bose\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the Biden administration had pressured the company to \"censor\" COVID-19 content during the pandemic, apparently referring to White House requests to take down misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccines.\n\nIn a letter dated Aug. 26, Zuckerberg told the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that he regretted not speaking up about this pressure earlier, as well as other decisions he had made as the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp around removing certain content.\n\nIn July 2021, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said social media platforms like Facebook \"are killing people\" for allowing misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on its platform.\n\nOthers like former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy publicly said the company was not doing enough to take down misinformation, and was making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.\n\nFacebook said at the time it was taking \"aggressive steps\" to fight such misinformation. The Biden administration ultimately eased up on its criticism, even as vaccine lies continued to spread on social media.\n\nIn the letter to the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee on Monday, Zuckerberg said his company was \"pressured\" into \"censoring\" content and that the company would push back if it faced such demands again.\n\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, which was posted by the Judiciary Committee on its Facebook page.\n\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret we were not more outspoken about it,\" he wrote. \"I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe White House said in a statement the administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety when confronted with a deadly pandemic.\n\n\"Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\"\n\nZuckerberg has recently tried to appeal to conservative users, by complimenting Republican nominee Donald Trump’s response to an assassination attempt as \"badass\" and going on right-wing podcasts. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jim Jordan, is a longtime Trump ally.\n\nIn its Facebook post, the Judiciary Committee called the letter a \"big win for free speech\" and said that Zuckerberg had admitted that \"Facebook censored Americans\".\n\nIn the letter, Zuckerberg also said he would not make any contributions to support electoral infrastructure in this year's presidential election so as to \"not play a role one way or another\" in the November vote.\n\nDuring the last election, which was held in 2020 during the pandemic, the billionaire contributed $400 million via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, his philanthropy venture with his wife, to support election infrastructure, a move that drew criticism and lawsuits from some groups that said the move was partisan.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington and Gnaneshwar Rajan in Bengaluru; editing by Miral Fahmy, Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)",

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the strategy returned +3.74% net of fees compared to +8.34% and +4.28% returns for The Russell 1000 Growth Index and the S&P 500 Index. The strategy's performance was negatively impacted by the stock selection within the information technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary. Following a robust performance in the first six months, it appears that stocks are poised to enter the second half of the year with strong momentum. The picture is still favorable because of robust corporate profitability, decreasing inflation, and high enterprise spending.

(NASDAQ:META) stock closed at $521.12 per share with a market capitalization of $1.318 trillion.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company's initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street’s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta's stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\n\nSince then, Meta has demonstrably shifted its strategic focus. The company has prioritized operational efficiency, implemented strategies to monetize Reels effectively, and initiated a robust artificial intelligence (AI) development program. We believe the focus on AI represents a more prudent capital allocation strategy compared to the earlier metaverse initiative. Meta AI holds significant potential to unlock substantial monetization opportunities and enhance user engagement, while maintaining tight controls on operating costs...\" (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg alleged that Facebook was “pressured” by the US government to censor content related to Covid-19 during the global pandemic and that he regrets the company’s decision to accede to the demands.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\n“In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire,” Zuckerberg wrote in a letter to the Committee on the Judiciary of the US House of Representatives. And while it was Meta’s decision whether to remove content, he continues, “the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, Facebook officials drew ire from critics of lockdowns, vaccines and masking mandates because it removed certain posts, saying they contained misinformation related to the virus or otherwise went against its policies. In all, Facebook took down more than 20 million pieces of content in just over a year. Zuckerberg joins other social media executives, including Jack Dorsey, former CEO of blogging platform Twitter, in lamenting past instances of content moderation that, in their view, went too far.\n\nThere’s a growing global debate over how far social media companies should go in policing the comments, images and other content posted by their users. Some platforms believe they should be hands off when it comes to telling users what they can and can’t say online, while some governments say that an overly laissez-faire stance can beget criminal behavior. French officials arrested Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov during the weekend, alleging that the company failed to adequately combat crime on the messaging app, including the spread of child sexual abuse material.\n\nOn the eve of the US presidential election, pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against former president Donald Trump, Zuckerberg is also taking pains to appear non-partisan. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another — or to even appear to be playing a role,” Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, the contents of which were posted to the Facebook page of the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed by Meta. He was writing in reference to contributions made in the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "title": "California AI bill sparks debate in Silicon Valley as some tech giants call it a threat to innovation",
        "content": "A first of its kind AI bill is winding its way through California, causing infighting between groups of AI pioneers.\n\nThe AI safety bill SB 1047 would put more responsibility on any developer spending more than $100 million to build an AI model. The requirements include: safety testing, implementing safeguards, and allowing the state attorney general to take action against the developer of any AI model that causes “severe harm,” such as mass casualties or incidents causing $500 million or more in damages.\n\nCompanies must agree to third-party audits and implementing a kill switch that can turn off the technology at any time. The bill also proposes protections for whistleblowers.\n\nCalifornia state Senator Scott Wiener, co-author of the bill, accused some opponents of “fear mongering” to try and stop the state legislation from being passed.\n\n“There’s been a lot of drama and dramatic statements and misstatements by some of the opposition,” Wiener said. “The large labs have committed repeatedly and vociferously to perform safety evaluations on their large models and that’s what this bill requires. Taking voluntary commitment and making it mandatory.”\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate and is scheduled for a vote in the State Assembly by the end of this week. It’ll return for a final vote in the Senate since it’s been amended multiple times. If passed it'll go to Governor Gavin Newsom for signing. Newsom hasn't signaled which way he’s leaning.\n\nWiener, who represents San Francisco, held a virtual press conference on Wednesday with supporters of the bill, including Yoshua Bengio, known as one of the “godfathers of AI,” Center for AI Safety director Dan Hendrycks, Economic Security California director Terri Oll, Encode Justice's vice president of political affairs Sunny Gandhi, and AI startup Ava's CEO Thibault Duchemin.\n\nWiener called SB 1047 “reasonable” and “light-touch”, and referenced Meta (META)’s AI model Llama. \"Meta has already committed to doing this testing,\" he claimed, so this bill should not cause the company to stop open sourcing the model.\n\n\"We’re working very hard to make the case to my colleagues in the assembly that this bill is worthy of supporting, we certainly have a path to pass it on the assembly floor,\" Wiener told Yahoo Finance. \"The governor has made statements that are very consistent with my own thinking — that regulation could be appropriate here and we want to make sure we’re fostering innovation as well.” California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nLast week Anthropic wrote an open letter to Governor Newsom, showing cautious support for the amended bill. In the letter, the company acknowledged the changes and said the bill was \"substantially improved, to the point where we believe its benefits likely outweigh its costs.\" Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark shared the letter on X, noting that it “isn’t an endorsement.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe amended bill removed the creation of a \"Frontier Model Division\" to police frontier models. It also dropped criminal perjury for lying about the models and will instead rely on existing laws.\n\nIn a letter to Wiener, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer Jason Kwon wrote that while it supports some of the bill's provisions, AI regulations should be left for the federal government to decide on.\n\n“A federally-driven set of AI policies, rather than a patchwork of state laws, will foster innovation and position the US to lead the development of global standards,\" wrote Kwon.\n\nBut two former OpenAI researchers, Daniel Kokotajlo and William Saunders, said they’re disappointed in OpenAI’s decision to oppose it. \"Sam Altman, our former boss, has repeatedly called for AI regulation,\" they wrote in a letter to Gov. Newsom last week. \"Now, when actual regulation is on the table, he opposes it.\"\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Andreessen Horowitz are also among the big names who call the bill a threat to innovation and research. Some fear it will put California at a disadvantage and possibly risk losing AI companies based in Silicon Valley.\n\nSB1047 is also facing criticism from prominent figures in the industry. Dr. Fei-Fei Li, known as the “Godmother of AI” and the co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, wrote in Fortune earlier this month that the bill’s penalties and restrictions would have “unintended consequences” on innovation.\n\nLi said SB 1047 “will harm our budding AI ecosystem, especially the parts of it that are already at a disadvantage to today’s tech giants: the public sector, academia, and ‘little tech.”\n\nWiener is facing opposition from some of his Democratic colleagues as well. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the bill, calling it “well-intentioned but ill-informed.” And eight California House members: Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna G. Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan and Lou Correa are urging Newsom to veto the measure.\n\nWiener said he would welcome the federal government to preempt SB 1047 with strong AI safety regulation. “Congress has been completely paralyzed when it comes to technology policy,” Wiener said. “There are good people in Congress working to do so but the institution as a whole has not acted in the way it needs to act.\"\n\nLawmakers in California have introduced 50 AI-related measures aimed at regulating the emerging technology. There’s currently no federal law that sets guardrails for AI developers. If passed and signed into law, SB 1047 could become the first real piece of AI regulation in the country.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): A Good Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nAn Analysis of the Technology Industry\n\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\n\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.\n\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:\n\n“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”\n\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\n\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the owner of the world's most engaging social media apps namely Facebook and Instagram, and two of the most commonly used messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger. The company is now eyeing to become a leader in AI chatbots. The stock was held by 219 hedge funds during Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $42.54 billion. Citadel Investment Group is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $6.27 billion.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has proved to be a leading technology company through its decade-long history of generating record revenues. Over the past 10 years the company has grown its top line by 31%, its bottom line by 36% and its levered free cash flow by 26%.\n\nMuch like its historic growth, the company continued to deliver robust growth during the most recent quarter i.e. Q2 2024. Its revenue grew 22% year-over-year to reach $39.1 billion. Management believes that two main factors drive revenue for the company. Number one is its ability to deliver an engaging experience and the second is its effective monetization of the engagement. And the quarterly results show that the company performed well in both the indicators.\n\nThe advertisement revenue was also up 22% year-over-year to reach $38.3 billion. On the other hand, even after being in business for a long time, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) still witnessed an increase in daily active users which surpassed 3.2 billion, with WhatsApp alone reaching over 100 million monthly active users.\n\nThe company is now focusing on artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and challenge the Magnificent Seven to become the most used AI assistant. The competitive edge of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lies in the fact that AI is not one of its core businesses.\n\nYes, you read it right. The fact that AI is its core business and instead it generates most of the revenues from core social media platforms gives the company leverage to work on its AI large language model without the threat of losing revenue. Management has leveraged this edge to gain another strategic advantage by making its Llama model code open-source, allowing outside developers to make optimizations and improvements. Management believes open-source has the potential to improve the company’s language model much faster as compared to closed-sourced models.\n\nIn addition, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Ray-Ban Meta Glasses and Quest 3 have become a hit sooner than expected and are contributing revenue growth to its Reality Labs division. The Reality Labs division witnessed a 27.8% year-over-year increase in revenue, amounting to $353 million during the quarter.\n\nBased on the strong performance across the board, the net income also improved by an impressive 73% to reach more than 13 million. Moreover, the company also generated around $10.9 billion in free cash flow, giving it financial backing to invest in its AI ventures and return to its shareholders. Looking ahead, management believes next quarter revenue to be between $38.5 to $41 billion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American stocks.\n\nWith August Ending, What Can We Expect From US Markets?\n\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\n\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\n\nHow Would a Potential Rate Cut Impact The Markets?\n\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\n\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a major company in the communications sector since it operates the world's largest social network. The main revenue growth driver for the company is online advertising, which Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does exceptionally well through its numerous social media platforms.\n\nWith the rise of AI and advertisement demand, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has only made its business model and growth more robust. The company's revenue grew by 22% year-over-year in the second quarter, because of these factors. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also gaining a lot of popularity because of its immense contributions to generative AI development, with the company calculated to have ramped up spending on this development to over $20 billion annually.\n\nThere were 219 hedge funds long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $42.5 billion.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "It's been another great year for the stock market. As of this writing, the benchmark index, the S&P 500, is up nearly 18%.\n\nYet, if you know where to look, there are even better long-term buy-and-hold opportunities out there. Let's cover two tech stocks that are each up more than 50% year to date. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSpotify Technologies\n\nSpotifyTechnologies(NYSE: SPOT) tops the list of tech stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade. The company, which operates the world's largest audio streaming platform, continues to impress.\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Spotify are up 339%, making it one of the top-performing stocks over that period. The secret to its stock market success? Spotify has combined revenue growth with cost-cutting. When done right, that's a powerful combination.\n\nSpotify's trailing-12-month revenue has increased to $15.7 billion, up from $13.6 billion one year ago. Similarly, 12-month net income has increased to $500 million versus a nearly $800 million loss a year earlier.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the company relies on its premium users to provide roughly 90% of its sales. Those users pay a subscription fee for access to ad-free music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Meanwhile, the company derives about 10% of its total revenue from ad-based listening.\n\nRegarding its expenses, Spotify has embarked on a series of cost-cutting measures over the last few years, including reducing staff levels, trimming its marketing budget, and canceling some content projects.\n\nIn turn, the company is firing on all cylinders. Granted, Spotify operates in a competitive field, with Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet all offering their own form of audio streaming.\n\nHowever, Spotify has more than held its own. With over 600 million listeners and almost 250 million subscribers, Spotify has established itself within the audio streaming market. Investors looking for a growth stock with legs should consider Spotify.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nNext is MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META), the operator of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nGranted, I've had my concerns with Meta, particularly around the tens of billions of dollars the company chose to spend on the Metaverse. However, one fact is undeniable: Meta generates cash at an almost unbelievable level. This company can afford to take some expensive risks. And I'm sure that's one of the reasons Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg felt comfortable pouring $46 billion into the company's Reality Labs segment -- money that heretofore has not generated any return.\n\nAt any rate, let's take a closer look at Meta's cash flow. In the last 12 months, the company has generated $50 billion in free cash flow.\n\nStory continues META Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMETA Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n\nIt's a staggering sum, and it puts Meta into rarified air. Its $50 billion in free cash flow, for example, is comparable to the total free cash flows from energy giants ExxonMobil and Chevron -- combined.\n\nNo wonder the company initiated its first-ever regular dividend payment this year. After all, finding the cash to pay for those dividends is no problem. The new payout policy shows that Facebook has plenty of surplus cash profits on hand, in search of a shareholder-friendly cash management policy.\n\nWhat's more, as long as Meta Platforms remains disciplined in its spending, there's plenty more cash flow on the way. Analysts expect the company to grow its sales by 20% this year and a further 13% in 2025. Those rising revenue figures should support even more free cash flow and perhaps even higher dividend payouts at some point. All of this should make investors happy to own Meta Platforms for the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings highlight a busy end of August: What to know this week",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told investors on Friday \"time has come for policy to adjust.\"\n\nIn response, stocks finished the week near record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.\n\nBut the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test this week with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.\n\nA done deal\n\nOn Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.\n\nBut he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.\n\nPowell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.\n\nWith only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.\n\n\"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 38.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen the day prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nCapital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.\n\n\"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\"\n\nWhile Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomists expect annual \"core\" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.\n\nPowell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\"\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.\n\nAs has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.\n\nThe stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.\n\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.\"We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.\"\n\nVinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.\n\n\"Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,\" Vinh said.\n\nCharles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment office Omar Aguilar said the release will be a \"very anticipated\" release for the broader market too.\n\n\"What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,\" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday.

(I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nTech volatility could be 'behind us'\n\nWhipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.\n\n\"I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,\" Snider said.\n\nThe rally in this group — which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia — between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.\n\n\"The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,\" Snider added. \"Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.\"\n\nFor the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.\n\nSnider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"\n\nHe added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\n\n\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.\n\nNow, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.\n\nNothing like price to change an investor's feelings.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)\n\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)\n\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)\n\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

        "title": "AI's insatiable energy demand is going nuclear",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is ubiquitous in today’s world, not just for being one of the biggest and most established online marketplaces but also for being among the largest data center providers.\n\nWhat Amazon is far less known for is being the owner and operator of nuclear power plants.\n\nYet that’s exactly what its cloud subsidiary, AWS, did in March, purchasing a $650 million nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the surface, the deal indicates Amazon’s ambitious expansion plans. But dig deeper, and the company’s purchase of a nuclear power facility speaks to a broader issue that Amazon and other tech giants are grappling with: the insatiable demand for energy from artificial intelligence. An aerial view of an Amazon Web Services data center situated near single-family homes on July 17, 2024, in Stone Ridge, Virginia. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images) (Nathan Howard via Getty Images)\n\nIn Amazon's case, AWS purchased Talen Energy’s Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center to co-locate its rapidly expanding AI data center next to a power source, keeping up with the energy demands that artificial intelligence has created.\n\nThe strategy is a symptom of an energy reckoning that has been building as AI has been creeping into consumers' daily lives — powering everything from internet searches to smart devices and cars.\n\nCompanies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) continue to enhance AI capabilities with new products and services. Each AI task requires vast computational power, which translates into substantial electricity consumption through energy-hungry data centers.\n\nEstimates suggest that by 2027, global AI-related electricity consumption could rise by 64%, reaching up to 134 terawatt hours annually — or the equivalent of the electricity usage of countries like the Netherlands or Sweden.\n\nThis raises a critical question: How are Big Tech companies addressing the energy demands that their future AI innovations will require?

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nThe rising energy consumption of AI\n\nAccording to Pew Research, more than half of Americans interact with AI at least once a day.\n\nProminent researcher and data scientist Sasha Luccioni, who serves as the AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a company that builds tools for AI applications, often discusses AI's energy consumption.\n\nLuccioni explained that while training AI models is energy-intensive — training the GPT-3 model, for example, used about 1,300 megawatt-hours of electricity — it typically only happens once. However, the inference phase, where models generate responses, can require even more energy due to the sheer volume of queries.\n\nFor example, when a user asks AI models like ChatGPT a question, it involves sending a request to a data center, where powerful processors generate a response. This process, though quick, uses approximately 10 times more energy than a typical Google search.\n\nStory continues Rep. Jennifer Wexton uses an AI program on her iPad at her home in Leesburg, Va., on Friday, July 19, 2024. (AP Photo/John McDonnell) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The models get used so many times, and it really adds up quickly,\" Luccioni said. She noted that depending on the size of the model, 50 million to 200 million queries can consume as much energy as training the model itself.\n\n\"ChatGPT gets 10 million users a day,\" Luccioni said. \"So within 20 days, you have reached that 'ginormous' ... amount of energy used for training via deploying the model.\"\n\nThe largest consumers of this energy are Big Tech companies, known as hyperscalers, that have the capacity to scale AI efforts rapidly with their cloud services. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Meta (META), and Amazon alone are projected to spend $189 billion on AI in 2024.\n\nAs AI-driven energy consumption grows, it puts additional strain on the already overburdened energy grids. Goldman Sachs projects that by 2030, global data center power demand will grow by 160% and could account for 8% of total electricity demand in the US, up from 3% in 2022.\n\nThis strain is compounded by aging infrastructure and the push toward the electrification of cars and manufacturing in the US. According to the Department of Energy, 70% of US transmission lines are nearing the end of their typical 50- to 80-year life cycle, increasing the risk of outages and cyberattacks. Large electrical transmission lines run through grasslands to power the newly completed Meta's Facebook data center in Eagle Mountain, Utah on July 18, 2024. (GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images) (GEORGE FREY via Getty Images)\n\nMoreover, renewable energy sources are struggling to keep pace.\n\nLuccioni pointed out that grid operators are extending the use of coal-powered plants to meet the rising energy needs, even as renewable energy generation expands.\n\nAI upends Big Tech sustainability pledges\n\nMicrosoft and Google have acknowledged in their sustainability reports that AI has hindered their ability to meet climate targets. For instance, Microsoft’s carbon emissions have increased by 29% since 2020 due to AI-related data center construction.\n\nStill, renewable energy remains a crucial part of Big Tech’s strategies, even if it cannot meet all of AI's energy demands.\n\nIn May 2024, Microsoft signed the largest corporate power purchasing agreement on record with property and asset management giant Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of new renewable power capacity globally through wind, solar, and other carbon-free energy generation technologies. Additionally, the company has invested heavily in carbon removal efforts to offset an industry-record 8.2 million tons of emissions.\n\nAmazon has also made significant investments in renewable energy, positioning itself as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the fourth consecutive year. The company's portfolio now includes enough wind and solar power to supply 7.2 million US homes annually.\n\nHowever, as Yahoo Finance reporter Ines Ferre noted (video above), “The issue with renewables is that at certain times of the day, you have to also go into energy storage because you may not be using that energy at that time of the day.” Google's first data center in Germany is pictured during its inauguration in Hanau near Frankfurt, Germany, on Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBeyond sourcing cleaner energy, Big Tech is also investing in efficiency. Luccioni said companies like Google are now developing AI-specific chips, such as the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), that are optimized for AI tasks instead of using graphical processing units (GPUs), which were created for gaming technology.\n\nNvidia claims that its latest Blackwell GPUs can reduce AI model energy use and costs by up to 25 times compared to earlier versions.\n\nFor a glimpse of what lies ahead for tech firms that don’t manage energy costs, look no further than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). TSMC makes more than 90% of the world’s most advanced AI chips and has seen energy costs double over the past year, reducing the company’s margins by nearly a full percentage point, according to CFO Wendell Huang.\n\nIn order to more accurately gauge energy demands and reduce future costs, experts say transparency is key.\n\n\"We need more regulation, especially around transparency,\" said Luccioni, who is working on an AI energy star-rating project that aims to help developers and users choose more energy-efficient models by benchmarking their energy consumption.\n\nWhen it comes to tech companies' priorities, always follow the money, or in this case, the investments. Utility companies and tech giants are expected to spend $1 trillion on AI in the coming years.\n\nBut according to Luccioni, AI might not just be the problem — it could also be part of the solution for addressing this energy crunch.\n\n\"AI can definitely be part of the solution,\" Luccioni said. \"Knowing, for example, when a ... hydroelectric dam might need fixing, [and the] same thing with the aging infrastructure, like cables, fixing leaks. A lot of energy actually gets lost during transmission and during storage. So AI can be used to either predict or fix [it] in real-time.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 AI terms Nvidia investors should know",
        "content": "Despite some volatility in the stock market so far in August, Nvidia stock (NVDA) remains up over 150% this year.\n\nDriving the stock is Nvidia's role in supplying chips to major tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) that are crucial for artificial intelligence technology amid the broader generative AI boom.\n\nOver a third of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) market cap gains in the first half of 2024 could be attributed to Nvidia. For some investors, the concentration of gains in a few stocks such as Nvidia seems risky. It was a point that was underlined earlier this month by a stock rout that briefly pushed the volatility index (^VIX) above 60 and shares of Nvidia down by as much as 10%.\n\nStocks ended up recovering, but the period offered a reminder to investors that they could seek AI opportunities elsewhere.\n\nFor those looking to gain an edge and diversify their tech holdings, understanding AI's core technology and terminology is essential.\n\nHere's a breakdown of a few of the terms you need to know to invest in the AI boom:\n\nInference\n\nInference is AI’s moment of truth. It's when an AI model like ChatGPT generates an answer to a prompt based on its previous training and learning. The quality of an AI system's inference relies heavily on its underlying technology stack, including the powerful chips that drive it. President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCompute\n\nCompute power is the driving force behind an AI system's success, similar to how horsepower propels a car. The greater the compute power, the more efficient and faster the inference process becomes.\n\nProcessing power, memory, and storage all fuel compute power, and chipmakers tend to focus on increased compute power for new chip releases because improvements in compute power with each chip generation could allow companies to charge more, which typically bodes well for future profit margins.\n\nGPUs\n\nGraphics processing units, or GPUs, are advanced and expensive chips that power AI. Their quality can help determine the speed of AI computations. Nvidia, which began working on GPUs in the '90s, owns over 80% of the GPU market and mentioned the term 19 times in its first quarter earnings presentation. Nvidia’s GPUs have increased AI inference performance by a thousand times over the last decade.\n\nHyperscalers\n\nBig Tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon are considered hyperscalers, or those capable of rapidly scaling AI. With products and services such as Microsoft's Copilot, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta's Llama, these companies are significant both as consumers of AI chips and competitors to chipmakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "One of the most notable transitions in recent decades has been the ascent of technology purveyors among the world's most valuable companies. It was just two decades ago that industrial and energy stalwarts General Electric and ExxonMobil topped the list in terms of market cap, valued at $319 billion and $283 billion, respectively. Now, just 20 years later, it's technology that dominates the list.\n\nLeading the way are three of the most recognizable tech companies in the world. Apple currently tops the list at $3.4 trillion. Microsoft and Nvidia are close behind, each valued of $3 trillion.\n\nWith a market cap of just $1.3 trillion, it might seem premature to suggest that Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is on track to join the $3 trillion club. However, the stock has gained 163% over the past year and 495% over the past five years (as of this writing), driven by strong operating results that should continue. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta has several distinct advantages, and its ever-expanding social media empire, market dominance, and strategic adoption of AI could drive its membership in this elite fraternity.\n\nAn ongoing and robust recovery\n\nWhile Meta Platforms was punished during the economic downturn, the stock has come roaring back, propelled higher by impressive financial results. In the second quarter, revenue of $39 billion climbed 22% year over year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 jumped 73%.\n\nThe financial results were driven by solid user metrics. The number of people who paid daily visits one of Meta's family of social media sites -- which includes Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp -- grew to 3.27 billion, up 7% year over year.\n\nHelping fuel the robust results was the ongoing rebound in online marketing, which is improving thanks to gains in the overall economy. Meta's social media ecosystem plays host to the company's digital advertising.\n\nThe online ad arena is dominated by the industry's two leading players. In 2023, Alphabet's Google controlled an estimated 39% of the worldwide digital ad revenue, followed by Meta with 18%, according to data compiled by business intelligence platform Statista.\n\nAs the world's second-largest digital advertiser, Meta Platforms is well positioned to reap the benefits of the rebound, which could be substantial.\n\nMultiple growth drivers\n\nWorldwide ad spending is expected to rise by 8% to more than $1 trillion in 2024, according to ad industry researcher WARC Media. Social media is expected to be the fastest-growing medium in digital advertising, capturing nearly 22% of total ad spending, according to the report. It goes on to say that Meta is \"on course to record oversized gains in the coming months.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond advertising, however, is Meta's strategy to profit from the windfall of artificial intelligence (AI). The company has leveraged the data it captures from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its own state-of-the-art large language models, which forms the foundation of generative AI.\n\nThe result is Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), which feeds its flagship Meta AI chatbot. Earlier this year, the company unveiled Llama 3, declaring Meta AI as \"one of the world's leading AI assistants.\" The company made this system free to individual users (collecting even more data) while it charges the largest cloud infrastructure providers for the privilege of including it in their offerings.\n\nWhile there's a great deal of emphasis on AI, it isn't the only growth driver that could push Meta higher. Meta's Reality Labs -- home of its Oculus virtual reality (VR) business, Quest VR headsets, and its ever-changing metaverse blueprint -- has had little to show for its efforts thus far. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is convinced these investments will bear fruit, ultimately boosting Meta's profits.\n\nGiven the rebounding ad market, multiple growth drivers, and the tailwinds driving generative AI, it shouldn't take long for Meta Platforms to earn its membership in the $3 trillion club.\n\nThe path to $3 trillion\n\nMeta currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.35 trillion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 123% to drive its value to $3 trillion. According to Wall Street, Meta is expected to generate revenue of $161.6 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta would have to grow its revenue to roughly $360 billion annually to support a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Meta of 14% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $3 trillion market cap as soon as 2031. It's worth noting that Meta has grown its annual revenue by nearly 1,000% over the past decade, so those expectations could well be conservative.\n\nFurthermore, at 27 times earnings, Meta is selling for a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500. That's an attractive price to pay for a company with a dominant market share, strong momentum, and multiple ways to win.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) is back. But it’s about to be put to the test again.\n\nThe next big event for the market is the chip darling’s earnings report, set for after the bell Wednesday.\n\nAnd it’s not just Nvidia stock that’s on the line: Nvidia’s results will set the pace for other AI players.\n\n“Nvidia’s report and guidance will be absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade,” tech investor Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe past several weeks have been a roller-coaster ride for tech investors. Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%.\n\nAnd second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period.\n\nBut strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\n“Nvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,” Ives told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIves, who expects a “shock and awe” quarter from Nvidia, says continued strong demand for the company’s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta, Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant’s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech’s next move.\n\n“Nvidia is a bellwether of the Magnificent Seven and AI trade,” Shmulik explained. “If there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.”\n\nSo far this year, Nvidia’s stock has soared. Shares are up 180% over the past year and up nearly 2,900% over the past five years — setting the bar very high for earnings this quarter.\n\nEstimates are for Nvidia's revenue to grow 112% in its latest quarter, marking a dramatic slowdown from over 250% growth one year ago. For Wall Street, consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it’s safe to say the stakes are high.

        "title": "Prediction: On Aug. 28, This Figure From Nvidia Will Confirm an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bubble That's in the Early Stages of Bursting",
        "content": "Since 2023 began, no trend has been more responsible for lifting Wall Street's major stock indexes to new heights than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe allure of AI is the long-term capacity for software and systems to learn without human intervention. This gives AI-driven software and systems the ability to become more efficient at their tasks, and potentially evolve to learn new skills. With an addressable market that spans most sectors and industries, the analysts at PwC believe AI can add a jaw-dropping $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030.\n\nAlthough dozens of companies have benefited from the AI revolution, none has been the poster child of success more so than semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is leading the next supposed leap forward in business innovation\n\nIn short order, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) became the go-to chip used by businesses to run generative AI solutions and train large language models (LLMs). With demand swamping supply, Nvidia has had no trouble meaningfully increasing the price of its H100 GPUs to between $30,000 and $40,000 per chip, or roughly two to three times what key rivals are charging for their AI-data center hardware.\n\nThe beauty of higher price points is that they have directly benefited Nvidia's bottom line. Over the previous five reported fiscal quarters, ended April 28, 2024, the company's adjusted gross margin has increased by close to 14 percentage points to 78.35%.\n\nNvidia hasn't been shy about investing for the future, either. Its next-generation Blackwell platform, which is slated to hit the market next year, will accelerate computing capacity in six areas, including quantum computing and generative AI, and be more energy efficient than its predecessor. Meanwhile, in June, CEO Jensen Huang briefly teased the all-new Rubin GPU architecture, which will run on a different processor (known as Vera) and debut in 2026.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle that's helped Nvidia's market cap grow by more than $2.8 trillion since the start of 2023 is its CUDA platform. This is the software platform developers use to build LLMs, and it's working hand-in-hand with the company's leading hardware to keep enterprise clients loyal to its ecosystem of solutions.\n\nAlthough it's been a seemingly perfect operating ramp, Wall Street is liable to see just how fallible Nvidia and AI as a technology are as a whole on Aug. 28.\n\nThis all-important figure from Nvidia could signal the bursting of the AI bubble\n\nThis coming Wednesday, Aug. 28, Wall Street's AI darling will lift the hood on its fiscal second-quarter operating results.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the previous five quarters, Nvidia has done nothing short of obliterate even the loftiest analyst expectations. A combination of strong enterprise demand for its AI-GPUs, exceptional pricing power, and limited competition, has allowed the company to build up a backlog that would make any tech company envious.\n\nHowever, headline revenue and profit figures aren't going to tell the complete story come Aug. 28. Even if sales and profits sail past the consensus of analysts, another key figure can portend the end to AI euphoria. I'm talking about Nvidia's adjusted gross margin. Nvidia's \"adjusted\" gross margin excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, and a few other costs. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFollowing the release of Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results, Huang and his team offered adjusted gross margin guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points). This guidance implies a 235- to 335-basis-point decline from the first quarter.\n\nWhile a median expected drop of 285 basis points in adjusted gross margin might sound like much ado about nothing considering the roughly 1,370 basis points Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded by over the prior five quarters, it's the reasons behind this forecast decline that are the real concern.\n\nNvidia's compute advantages are unlikely to save it from the inevitable\n\nAlthough demand has been undeniably strong for Nvidia's H100 GPU, it's the company's pricing power that's done most of the heavy lifting. Sales growth has handily outpaced an increase in cost of revenue, signaling that pricing power, fueled by persistent AI-GPU scarcity, is the company's core driver.\n\nThe problem for Nvidia is that it's not the only show in town. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPUs, which are, on average, 50% to 75% cheaper than Nvidia's H100. AMD also hasn't been hindered by early stage chip fabrication supplier issues in the same way Nvidia has.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Even with these internally developed chips destined for complementary roles, they're ultimately cheaper and more easily accessible than Nvidia's hardware. These companies represent about 40% of Nvidia's sales, and they're all signaling a reduced future reliance on Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nTo make matters worse, reports emerged a little over two weeks ago that Nvidia's prized Blackwell chip would be delayed by \"at least three months\" due to design flaws and supplier constraints. Nvidia not being able to meet enterprise demand in a timely manner opens the door for AMD, Samsung, and Huawei to steal share.\n\nNvidia's biggest gross margin lift has come from AI-GPUs being extremely scarce. But as new chips hit the market, and the company's own top customers fill their valuable data center \"real estate\" with in-house chips, Nvidia will inevitably find that its pristine pricing power is eroding. The company's median forecast of a 285-basis-point sequential-quarter drop in adjusted gross margin is evidence that AI euphoria is fading. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen the AI bubble bursts, no company will likely be hit harder than Nvidia\n\nLooking beyond Nvidia's Aug. 28 report, history is another monkey wrench for the AI revolution.\n\nSince the advent of the internet three decades ago, there hasn't been a single innovation, technology, or buzzy trend with a mammoth addressable market that's avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event. Without exception, investors always overestimate the use case(s) and consumer/enterprise uptake of a new technology or trend, which eventually leads to disappointment, euphoria fading, and a bubble-bursting event.\n\nIncluding the internet, we've watched this play out with genome decoding, business-to-business commerce and networking, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cryptocurrency, cannabis, blockchain technology, virtual/augmented reality, and the metaverse.\n\nTo add to the point, you'll find that few of the companies building out AI data centers have definitive plans for how they're going to use the technology to increase sales and profits. For instance, Meta Platforms is investing more than $10 billion in Nvidia's H100 GPUs, but has no immediate plans to profit from these investments in its AI data center.\n\nThe simple fact that most businesses lack a clear game plan when it comes to AI makes it crystal clear that we're dealing with the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nThis isn't to say that artificial intelligence can't, eventually (key word!), change the growth arc in a big way for corporate America -- but there's little question that the technology will need time to mature.\n\nIf the AI bubble does burst, as history suggests it will, there isn't a company that'll be hit harder than Nvidia. It's adjusted gross margin in the coming week should provide confirmation that the beginning of this bubble-bursting event is underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The same Iranian hacking group believed to have targeted both the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns tried to go after the WhatsApp accounts of staffers in the administrations of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, Meta Platforms said Friday.\n\nMeta said it discovered the network of hackers, who posed as tech support agents for companies including Microsoft and Google, after individuals who received the suspicious WhatsApp messages reported them. Meta’s investigators linked the activity to the same network blamed for the hacking incident reported by Trump’s campaign.\n\nThe FBI this week said a hack by Iran of the Trump campaign and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign was part of a broader Iranian effort to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\n\nA statement Friday from Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, said that the hackers had tried to target the WhatsApp account of individuals in the Middle East, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as political and diplomatic officials — including unidentified officials associated with the Trump and Biden administrations. A “small cluster” of accounts was blocked by Meta, the company said.\n\n“We have not seen evidence of the targeted WhatsApp accounts being compromised, but out of an abundance of caution, we’re sharing our findings publicly, in addition to sharing information with law enforcement and our industry peers,” Meta said in a statement.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials say Iran’s increasingly aggressive use of cyberattacks and disinformation has several motives: to confuse and polarize voters in an effort to undermine confidence in U.S. democracy, to erode support for Israel, and to oppose candidates that it believes will increase tension between Washington and Iran.\n\nIran has vowed revenge against Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of an Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nIn July, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Iran’s government gave covert support to American protests against Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran posed as online activists, encouraged campus protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nMessages left with the Trump and Harris campaigns were not immediately returned Friday.\n\nView comments",

Kofman spent five years at Meta, where she was most recently a senior director of product management for generative AI, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nMeta declined to comment on Kofman’s departure. The owner of Facebook and Instagram has invested heavily in AI, seeking to improve its advertising business, for example, by using algorithms to better determine when and where to show ads and providing marketers with generative AI tools to help them create more effective campaigns.\n\nAI startups such as OpenAI are increasingly hiring business leaders with experience at the larger tech companies, particularly in social media, as they scale up and compete with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta.\n\nIn June, OpenAI hired former Instagram and Twitter executive Kevin Weil as chief product officer and former Nextdoor Chief Executive Officer Sarah Friar as chief financial officer. The ChatGPT-maker’s rival, Anthropic, also has recruited big tech talent recently, hiring former Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger as chief product officer in May.\n\nWhile OpenAI is adding to its leadership team, it has also faced some high-profile staff departures, including former co-founder John Schulman and prominent researcher Jan Leike, who both moved to Anthropic.\n\n--With assistance from Aisha Counts.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck FOMO Frenzy Fuels Taiwan Home Prices Despite Threat of China Invasion Five Questions With Deval Patrick at the DNC ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek have critisised European regulations surrounding open-source artificial intelligence, saying the continent risks falling behind because of complex rules.\n\nEurope, which \"has more open-source developers than America\", is well placed to make the most of the open-source AI wave, the CEOs said in a joint statement on Friday.\n\n\"Yet its fragmented regulatory structure, riddled with inconsistent implementation, is hampering innovation and holding back developers.\"\n\nThe CEOs said the tech industry in Europe faces \"overlapping regulations and inconsistent guidance on how to comply with them\" instead of clear rules.\n\nA streamlined regulatory framework would not only accelerate the growth of open-source AI, but also provide support to European developers and the broader creator ecosystem, they said.\n\nThe Irish privacy regulator in June asked Meta to not launch its AI models in Europe for the time being, after the company was told to delay plans of harnessing data from Facebook and Instagram users.\n\nGiven the current regulations, Meta will not be able to release its upcoming AI models such as Llama multimodal, which has the capability to understand images, in Europe.\n\nThis would mean Europeans will be \"left with AI built for someone else,\" the CEOs said.\n\nSpotify pointed to its early investment in AI to create personalised experiences for users that has led to the streaming service's success.\n\nLaws that have been designed to increase European sovereignty and competitiveness are achieving the opposite, they said, adding Europe should be \"simplifying and harmonising regulations by leveraging the benefits of a single yet diverse market.\"\n\nThe CEOs concluded that Europe needs a new approach with clearer policies and more consistent enforcement, adding it will miss a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity\" on its current path.\n\nThe EU Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Shreya Biswas)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet and Meta Platforms Just Sent a Major Warning to Nvidia Shareholders",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming spending on artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key piece of infrastructure for training and running large language models, the backbone of generative AI. Big tech companies like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on as many Nvidia GPUs as possible right now.\n\nThat's been great for Nvidia and its shareholders. Sales more than tripled in its fiscal first quarter, reaching a record $26 billion in total revenue. But that kind of growth can't last forever.\n\nAnalysts expect more modest sales growth of \"just\" 38.4% next year. But some comments from Nvidia's biggest customers suggest that number might be too high. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's biggest customers just admitted they're overspending on AI\n\nWhile Nvidia has seen its profits soar as a result of all the AI spending, the same isn't necessarily true of a lot of its biggest customers. A step up in capital expenditures like those required to build AI data centers can be a crunch on cash flow. That's especially true if those investments don't produce an immediate impact on revenue.\n\nThat's the challenge for cloud providers that rent computing infrastructure to developers. The three largest cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. If a developer comes to one of them and needs access to compute power they don't have, it will go to one of its competitors. As a result, they need to build data centers fast enough amid the current AI boom to ensure when a new customer comes to them, or an existing customer asks for more capacity, they can serve them.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made this clear when asked about spending on AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here,\" he told analysts. In other words, he's intentionally overspending right now to ensure he gets as many customers as possible. Microsoft and Amazon are likely taking a similar approach.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is building its own data center capacity to support its AI development. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has ambitions of turning Meta into the leading AI company in the world. And that requires having the infrastructure in place before the company's software is ready for training and deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,\" he said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\n\nHis comments echo Pichai's. Meta is spending now with the expectation that it will grow into its capacity. At some point, however, it will rightsize its data centers. At that point, it will significantly slow down its spending on servers and chips like Nvidia's.\n\nThese comments hold a lot of weight (on Nvidia's income statement)\n\nThe reason Nvidia shareholders should pay attention to everything Pichai, Zuckerberg, and a few other big-tech executives say about their AI spending is that the business has become heavily concentrated on those customers.\n\nTwenty-four percent of Nvidia's total sales in the first quarter came from just two customers. Between 60% and 70% of its revenue comes from just 10 customers, according to Seligman Investments analyst Paul Wick.\n\nWith all that revenue highly concentrated among just a handful of customers, a single change in the capital expenditure policy at one of them could drastically impact Nvidia's results. If Alphabet or Meta decide to cut back on spending in a couple of years after aggressively building capacity, Nvidia will see its growth slow considerably.\n\nThe stock is in a precarious position, with Nvidia shares trading at valuation multiples, with around 50x forward earnings and 40x enterprise value to revenue. If it continues to outperform management's guidance and analysts' expectations, the stock will continue zooming higher. But one quarter of poor results could send shares reeling. The comments from Alphabet and Meta suggest it may be only a matter of time before there's a stark pullback in AI spending.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Following billionaire investors can be worth your while, especially because they could have a long record of delivering excellent returns. One of the more successful fund managers is Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management. Coleman founded the firm in 2001 and currently has a net worth of over $5 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nAt the end of Q2 2024, Tiger Global's top two holdings were Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), with $6 billion in combined market value in these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Here's why they are smart buys for the long term.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nTiger Global has held a position in Microsoft since 2018, making it its second-largest holding. As of the second quarter, Tiger Global held 5.3 million shares worth nearly $2.4 billion. Over the last six years, the stock has climbed over 300%, compared to the S&P 500's 145% total return including dividends.\n\nMicrosoft is unstoppable on many fronts. More than 1.3 million businesses use Microsoft Office, and its Windows operating system holds a commanding 72% share of the desktop market.\n\nThis has been the heart of Microsoft's business for many years, and the new Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) assistant is proving to be an opportunity to further monetize its software. In the June-ending quarter, revenue from productivity software and other services grew 11% year over year, with Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions reaching 82.5 million.\n\nHowever, most investors are interested in the stock for its burgeoning cloud services business. Microsoft Azure is in a solid competitive position, having gained significant market share against the leader Amazon Web Services.\n\nAccording to Statista, the cloud enterprise market opportunity is estimated to reach $773 billion in 2024. Following such an opportunity, Microsoft spent $14 billion in capital expenditures last quarter alone, during which half of that went toward data centers and other infrastructure needs to support long-term growth.\n\nMicrosoft is ramping up investment across cloud and AI software while still reporting growing profits. Earnings increased by 10% year over year last quarter, and the Wall Street consensus has the company's earnings settling at an annualized rate of 13% over the next several years.\n\nNot all companies in technology are able to invest in AI and show profitable growth. For example, another leading cloud company, Snowflake, expects margins to be under pressure in the near term as it ramps up investment in AI hardware like graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's ability to deliver strong earnings growth while it makes these capital investments is why it's truly a best-in-class AI stock to buy for the long term.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta is Tiger Global's largest holding, with 7.4 million shares worth $3.7 billion at the end of June. Coleman's firm has held a position in the stock since 2016. It has delivered a market-crushing return of 360% over the last eight years.\n\nMeta is another Magnificent Seven stock that has great growth prospects. Global digital ad spending is expected to grow to $870 billion by 2027, according to Statista. This is an attractive opportunity for Meta's family of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which are monetized with ads and have over 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nAI will play a crucial role in helping the company deliver more relevant content to users, thereby encouraging more investment from advertisers who want their brands in front of a highly engaged pool of users. Meta already has over $14 billion this year in capital expenditures to support its technology infrastructure, including data centers and servers.\n\nMeta has clear advantages in the digital ad market, and it's already seeing results. Revenue was incredibly strong in the second quarter, up 22% year over year. Management said that ad revenue within online commerce on its apps was the largest contributor to that growth.\n\nLike Microsoft, Meta is positioned to benefit from AI while still reporting strong earnings growth to support shareholder returns. The company's earnings jumped 73% year over year last quarter.\n\nIt won't continue to grow earnings that strongly since management wants to ramp up the capacity to train more advanced AI models for its business to prepare for future growth, but it's committed to efficiently allocating capital across the business.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Meta to report long-term earnings growth of 19% on an annualized basis. The stock trades at a market average price-to-earnings multiple of 25, which should lead to excellent returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Cheapest Trillion-Dollar Stock: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta?",
        "content": "Six U.S. companies are valued at $1 trillion or more, and they all operate in the technology sector:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.44 trillion Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): $3.16 trillion Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): $3.14 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $2.07 trillion Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.87 trillion Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): $1.33 trillion\n\nAll of these companies are profitable, so they can be valued with the widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It's calculated by dividing the share price of a given company by its earnings per share. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.9, which is a good reference point: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia is the most expensive trillion-dollar stock today on a P/E basis. However, the company is growing so quickly it has a forward P/E ratio of just 33.1 based on next year's earnings forecast. In other words, its valuation is much more reasonable if investors are willing to hold it for a couple of years.\n\nThe cheapest stock of the group is Alphabet. A judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, and the U.S. Department of Justice wants to break up the company to resolve that issue. It could take years -- if it happens at all -- but combined with growing competition from artificial intelligence chatbots, which are threatening the dominance of Google Search, investors are treading cautiously with respect to Alphabet's valuation.\n\nFinally, Amazon deserves a mention. It's on track to generate $635 billion in revenue this year, which is more than any of its peers, and it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue).

        "title": "Meta Shares Are Flying High as Zuckerberg Sells His AI Vision",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Technology giants that want to spend big on artificial intelligence and stay in the good graces of investors should take a page out of Meta Platforms Inc.’s playbook.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago's Migrant Surge Is Stirring Trouble for Democrats in DNC Host City UK Transport Minister Clears Path for More 20mph Speed Zones With Self-Driving Vans, Hamburg Tries to Make Microtransit Work The Serious Work That Free Play Can Do\n\nThe Mark Zuckerberg run company has seen its shares gain 13% this month, far outperforming Big Tech peers despite reporting another jump in capital expenditures and pledging to spend even more going forward. The stock settled on Wednesday less than 1% short of its record closing price from last month.\n\nThe difference for Meta is that Zuckerberg did a better job of convincing investors that AI is helping to improve results in its core business — digital advertising. The AI boost for others like Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. hasn’t been as well articulated.\n\n“It was his best earnings call as a public CEO,” said Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management. “He explained the near-term benefits of AI, the long-term benefits and the timing of how all this is going to play out. And he did it in a compelling way.”\n\nMeta has been using AI to improve the way its advertisers can find interested users, adding efficiency to the business that makes up almost all of its revenue. The company is also using proprietary large language models for better content recommendations that help drive engagement across Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs a result, earnings per share and revenue in the second quarter easily exceeded analyst estimates, prompting JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth to declare that Meta “continues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI.”\n\nAt the same time, investors have grown more critical of spending by other Big Tech companies. Shares of Google-parent Alphabet have underperformed in the wake of its earnings report last month, which showed higher-than-expected capital spending even though profit and revenue beat estimates. Similar can be said of Microsoft, after its results highlighted slowing growth in the Azure cloud-computing business.\n\nAlphabet shares have fallen 9% following its July 23 earnings report, while Microsoft is roughly flat since its results were released on July 30.\n\n“Google sort of said, ‘Well, we have to spend money to keep up with everyone,’ which didn’t really sell it very well,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Microsoft sold it a little better. They’re effectively doing the same thing.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Zuckerberg has had plenty of experience being in Wall Street’s penalty box. Just a quarter ago, the stock took a beating after the company raised its capital spending forecast while delivering slower sales growth than anticipated. That followed a disastrous pivot to the so-called metaverse that required big spending with little hope of near-term payoffs — leading the stock to lose nearly two-thirds of its value in 2022.\n\nApple Inc., Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all poured more money into capex in the quarter that ended in June, bringing their combined outlays to a record $55 billion, a 55% jump on a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n“Meta has been and will continue to invest significantly in Generative AI, but has arguably articulated its vision of AI integration more clearly than its competitors,” said Andrew Ye, investment strategist at Global X ETFs.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMedia investor Edgar Bronfman Jr. raised his offer to take control of CBS parent Paramount Global to $6 billion, according to people familiar with his proposal, potentially upsetting the company’s plan to merge with independent producer Skydance Media. Xiaomi Corp. is willing to grow its nascent electric vehicle arm at the expense of profits for now, as it angles to join Tesla Inc. and BYD Co. among the world’s biggest automakers over the next decade or two. Elon Musk’s X attracted investment from a plethora of big names from Silicon Valley to global finance, including Sean “Diddy” Combs and billionaire Larry Ellison, according to a court document unsealed Wednesday. The National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigation into the recent crash and fire of a Tesla Inc. Semi truck, believed to be the first probe involving the company’s electric big rig. Neuralink Corp., Elon Musk’s brain-computer company, said surgery for its second implant in a human “went well” and the patient is now able to design 3D objects and play video games like Counter-Strike 2.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nIntuit Workday BILL Holdings Inc\n\n--With assistance from Tom Contiliano, Carmen Reinicke and Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck Covid Hobbled a Profitable Bond Trade.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Short Sellers Are Bullish On This Advertising Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other advertising stocks.\n\nWhen compared to the copy driven model of the late 1900s as popularized by shows such as Mad Men, the advertising era of 2024 is completely different. Today, advertisers have at their disposal the data of billions of people which they can characterize according to preference and target their ads to. This growth in digital advertising has been driven by the rise of video streaming platforms and digital publications, which continue to gain market share over paper newspapers.\n\nNowhere else is the impact of digital advertising in today's era clear as through the value of the world's largest search engine company. A mega cap stock, this firm has a market value of a whopping $2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market value. Yet, in another case of 2024 being a historic year of shifts for the technology industry as evidenced by technologies such as artificial intelligence, this firm is also facing the heat from the US government which might end up changing the very fabric of the industry.\n\nThe search engine giant, which earned $187 billion in trailing twelve month revenue from search and advertising, traces its roots back to the late 1990s when its founders created an algorithm called PageRank. This software determined which webpages were authoritative based on the amount and quality of backlinks they got, and as the engine grew, so did the firm's dominance in the global advertising industry as it processes more than 22 billion searches per day. However, this gravy train might be ending as a Washington judge ruled in August that its $26 billion in payments to other firms to make the platform the default option on their devices was an anti competitive behavior that locked others out in the industry.\n\nFollowing the ruling, there are rumors that the Justice Department might be considering breaking the company up by making it divest its mobile software and web browsing business divisions. However, any such decision will require court approval which will force the firm to comply. And while a court victory is great for news headlines, the US government has rarely broken up large companies in the modern era. The last such case was in 1982 through the breakup of the Bell System, and even if the browser and OS were made separate businesses, they are unlikely to survive on their own since both are provided to users for free.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot to mention, the long drawn nature of anti-trust action could take years, and end up being enforced when the industry is vastly different from what it is now. This is because artificial intelligence is gnawing at the heels of the industry, with products such as OpenAI's SearchGPT already in early stage releases. Speaking of AI, it's also making its mark on the advertising industry. Just as advertisers are able to rely on millions of users' data through search and social media platforms, AI helps them navigate through this data in novel and new ways.\n\nAs per McKinsey, marketing and sales could see a $931 billion productivity boost from AI through new features such as personalized campaigns and improved data use. These use cases have already become apparent, with the largest social media company in the world regularly sharing updates about how it is using AI to make advertisers' jobs easier on its platform. Two tools that it offers are the Advantage+ and Advantage+ Shopping platform which enables advertisers and sellers to automate their campaign operations and determine the best advertisements to run. The platforms also appear to be driving results, with the firm quoting a study that is \"demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns\" with revenue for the firm through the two AI platforms doubling annually during Q1 2024.\n\nSpeaking of revenue, the advertising industry's spending, which determines the fate of publishers is also determined by the state of the economy, consumer confidence, and advertisers' outlook. One such firm with brands in more than 100 companies shared during its Q2 2024 earnings call that while the advertising market is not at its best right now, it does appear to be recovering. This recovery is taking place in areas such as food and technology which joins strong performance in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beauty care. Another publisher, which is one of the most well known digital media and lifestyle platforms in the world that relies on programmatic advertising (data driven user targeting through ads), saw its programmatic revenue grow by 3% annually during Q2 even as broader advertising revenue dropped by 19% annually.\n\nWith these details in mind let's take a look at which advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. For stocks that are driving advertising technology, you should check out 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers, we listed the NASDAQ and NYSE listings of an advertising ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage. An added 23 stocks after an internet search were also analyzed, but all these had market caps below $300 million so they were excluded.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 1.1%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. It is also the social media firm mentioned in our introduction, and its user base of roughly 3.79 billion people means that without Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the advertising industry significantly shrinks. The firm offers a variety of products to two kinds of advertisers on its platform. These cater to advertising firms that are running campaigns for big businesses and small and medium businesses that rely on platforms such as the Facebook Marketplace. In the fiercely competitive AI race among big tech, a large chunk of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis depends on its ability to monetize AI and use the technologies to improve user experience and create new products for advertisers. This is in addition to the firm's ability to retain social media users amidst trend shifts among Gen Z.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company's \"year of efficiency,\" where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\"\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "What Is Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Share Price Doing?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Meta Platforms’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Meta Platforms seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $641.78, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of Meta Platforms look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 44%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? META’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock?

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The past few months have seen a bunch of artificial intelligence (AI)-related technology companies announce stock splits. In fact, of the five potential AI stock splits I wrote about back in May, four have already either executed or announced imminent splits.\n\nRemember, a stock split doesn't change the intrinsic value of a stock one iota. But it can open up the stock to more retail investors and/or employees who would like to buy shares in lower dollar amounts, and who don't have access to fractional share buying.\n\nWith stock-split fever in the air and the Nasdaq recovering from its late-July slump, even more AI-related stocks are seeing their share prices soar. With a high share price and the likelihood of more AI-fueled growth ahead, these three are the next candidates to split their stock in the near to medium term.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nOne might not think of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) as an AI leader, but don't underestimate CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his management team: Meta actually has the potential to beat current market leaders such as OpenAI and others at their own game.\n\nMeta obviously has the financial resources to invest in leading AI infrastructure, but its competitive advantage may be in Zuckerberg's decision to open-source the company's Llama model code. Open source essentially means giving away the code for free, but that allows outside developers to optimize and make improvements to the underlying model. That decision has the potential to increase Llama's innovation faster than closed-source competitors like OpenAI or the models coming from other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nMeta can afford to do this because selling direct access to its AI large language model isn't its core business. Rather, its core social media platforms all benefit from the increased potency of AI, which has shown the ability to increase user engagement and better target ads, which leads to more revenue per ad.\n\nThat was on display in the second quarter. Despite Meta's already enormous size, the company was able to grow daily active people by 7%, while increasing revenue by 22% and operating income by a whopping 58%.\n\nOf course, one day, Llama should become a revenue generator, as Zuckerberg has identified potential future use cases, such as agents automating a lot of tasks for creators, inserting ads into AI interactions, or potentially directly charging for higher, more advanced levels of AI modeling and compute. But for now, Meta can afford to take its time and develop those services.\n\nMeta is currently the only Magnificent Seven stock to have never split its stock. But with its share price already north of $525 per share and a very reasonable valuation at 26 times earnings, it's not far-fetched that a stock split may be in the near future. After all, this year has already seen another first for Meta, as the company initiated a dividend for the first time back in February.\n\nStory continues\n\nKLA Corporation\n\nKLA Corporation(NASDAQ: KLAC) has seen its stock surge in anticipation of an artificial intelligence investment boom. As the dominant player in process control equipment, which helps chipmakers check chip wafers for defects at multiple steps of the chipmaking process, KLA seems set for growth as leading-edge AI chips and memory become more and more complex.\n\nKLA has a dominant market share in the metrology and inspection end market, with its share as high as 55% in some verticals. That market dominance of a crucial semiconductor process enables high margins and free cash flow, with the company's operating margin coming in at a whopping 41% last quarter. These AI stocks could split their shares soon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nKLA's killer combination of growth and profitability is the reason it has raised its dividend at a 15% annualized rate since 2006. And it's also why the stock price has surged to $820 per share, making it ripe for a stock split.\n\nSemiconductor capital equipment peer Lam Research announced it would be splitting its stock back in May, to take effect in October, and its shares trade around the same price as KLA's today. Like KLA, Lam dominates a certain part of the chipmaking process, but a different step in etch and deposition. So, these two aren't really competitors, but they have similar high profit margins due to a lack of competition. Given their similar characteristics and the chip industry seemingly on the brink of an upturn, it's not unthinkable KLA Corporation may announce a split sometime soon.\n\nArista Networks\n\nAt $350 per share, Arista Networks(NYSE: ANET) may not undergo a 10-for-1 stock split like some of its tech peers have recently done, but it could split 2 or 3 for 1.\n\nArista was a disruptive company at the advent of the cloud computing age. Its new-age networking switch architecture fashioned data center switches out of best-of-breed merchant third-party hardware, lowering internal costs. Arista's EOS software is what ties it all together, enabling high performance, system intelligence, and lightning-fast speeds at lower costs than traditional switches.\n\nArista's software focus and huge scale affords it very high margins. Last quarter, Arista's revenue grew 15.9%, and its operating margin reached over 41% over the past 12 months, with an admirable return on equity of 34.5%. Those are top-tier levels of profitability and solid growth.\n\nArtificial intelligence needs efficient switching and routing as traditional data centers do, but on a bigger and more complex scale. So Arista is a natural beneficiary of the theme. But earlier this year, some may have grown concerned that in-house networking solutions from Nvidia, based on Infiniband technology, might become a competitive threat.\n\nBut Ethernet-based Arista seems to have put that to bed with recent results. In fact, Arista even unveiled a new holistic AI data center solution in collaboration with Nvidia on its recent earnings release, showing that the leading AI chipmaker still values collaboration with Arista and its leading ethernet-based solutions.\n\nLook for Arista to continue to innovate its EOS software and switching architecture for super-large AI clusters. With a bright future, expect Arista to continue riding the AI wave higher, and for a potential eventual stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Timely rotations help hedge funds navigate summer volatility: Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "In its latest “Hedge Fund Trend Monitor” report published Tuesday, Goldman Sachs highlights how timely rotations by hedge funds have helped them successfully navigate recent bouts of market volatility.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, hedge funds made significant positioning adjustments, particularly in the \"Magnificent\" mega-cap stocks, trimming their exposure even as these stocks continued to outperform. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were exceptions, with hedge funds increasing their stakes in these companies.\n\nThese moves, according to Goldman Sachs, lowered the Hedge Fund Crowding Index and helped funds mitigate the impact of the subsequent volatility that arose from a rotation away from mega-caps, which later evolved into a sharp cyclical-led selloff in early August.\n\nThe bank reveals that US equity long/short hedge funds have returned 9% year-to-date, outperforming broader market indices. The Hedge Fund VIP list, which tracks the most popular long positions, has delivered a 19% return, despite a 10% market selloff in July. This list includes stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which remain central to hedge fund portfolios.\n\n“Today, with the S&P 500 close to its high, hedge fund net and gross exposures register above 5-year averages but below levels carried before the selloff,” Goldman notes.\n\nIn another timely shift in the second quarter, hedge funds halted a rotation toward cyclicals that had begun in mid-2022.\n\nSpecifically, funds have moved their overweight position to Health Care, now the best-performing sector during the recent downturn relative to the Russell 3000. At the same time, they increased exposure to Industrials and Financials while reducing holdings in Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology.\n\nAccording to the note, this was the first time hedge funds lifted Financials to overweight since 2010.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTimely rotations help hedge funds navigate summer volatility: Goldman Sachs\n\nAlcon shares drop on earnings miss\n\nRussia's Rostec chief suggests protective measures on assembled car imports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A new web crawler launched by Meta last month is quietly scraping the internet for AI training data",
        "content": "Meta has quietly unleashed a new web crawler to scour the internet and collect data en masse to feed its AI model.\n\nThe crawler, named the Meta External Agent, was launched last month according to three firms that track web scrapers and bots across the web. The automated bot essentially copies, or \"scrapes,\" all the data that is publicly displayed on websites, for example the text in news articles or the conversations in online discussion groups.\n\nA representative of Dark Visitors, which offers a tool for website owners to automatically block all known scraper bots, said Meta External Agent is analogous to OpenAI’s GPTBot, which scrapes the web for AI training data. Two other entities involved in tracking web scrapers confirmed the bot’s existence and its use for gathering AI training data.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, updated a corporate website for developers with a tab disclosing the existence of the new scraper in late July, according to a version history found using the Internet Archive. Besides updating the page, Meta has not publicly announced the new crawler.\n\nA Meta spokesman said the company has had a crawler under a different name “for years,” although this crawler—dubbed Facebook External Hit— \"has been used for different purposes over time, like sharing link previews.”\n\n“Like other companies, we train our generative AI models on content that is publicly available online,” the spokesman said. “We recently updated our guidance regarding the best way for publishers to exclude their domains from being crawled by Meta’s AI-related crawlers.”\n\nScraping web data to train AI models is a controversial practice that has led to numerous lawsuits by artists, writers, and others, who say AI companies used their content and intellectual property without their consent. Some AI companies like OpenAI and Perplexity have struck deals in recent months that pay content providers for access to their data (Fortune was among several news providers that announced a revenue-sharing deal with Perplexity in July).\n\nFlying under the radar\n\nWhile close to 25% of the world’s most popular websites now block GPTBot, only 2% are blocking Meta’s new bot, data from Dark Visitors shows.\n\nIn order for a website to attempt to block a web scraper, it must deploy robots.txt, a line of code added to a codebase, in order to signal to a scraper bot that it should ignore that site’s information. However, typically the specific name of a scraper bot needs to be added as well in order for robots.txt to be respected. That’s difficult to accomplish if the name has not been openly disclosed. An operator of a scraper bot can also simply choose to ignore robots.txt – it is not enforceable or legally binding in any way.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch scrapers are used to pull mass amounts of data and written text from the web, to be used as training data for generative AI models, also referred to as large language models or LLMs, and related tools. Meta’s Llama is one of the largest LLMs available, and it powers things like Meta AI, an AI chat bot that now appears on various Meta platforms. While the company did not disclose the training data used for the latest version of the model, Llama 3, its initial version of the model used large data sets put together by other sources, like Common Crawl.\n\nEarlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s co-founder and longtime CEO, boasted on an earnings call that his company's social platforms had amassed a data set for AI training that was even “greater than the Common Crawl,” an entity that has scraped roughly 3 billion web pages each month since 2011.\n\nThe existence of the new crawler suggests Meta's vast trove of data may no longer be enough however, as the company continues to work on updating Llama and expanding Meta AI. LLMs typically need new and quality training data to keep improving in functionality. Meta is on track to spend up to $40 billion this year, mostly on AI infrastructure and related costs.\n\nAre you a Meta employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\n\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\n\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\n\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% — the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm recently beat market expectations on earnings for both the top and bottom lines, but left some investors concerned after it raised guidance for capital expenditures. The increased guidance for 2024, now up to $37 billion to $40 billion, reflected the rather large investments in the AI space. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said the firm was working hard to figure out the level of infrastructure needed to train advanced AI models as it looked at the compute clusters and data it needed to train future Meta AI products.\n\nThis level of commitment towards AI and the historical financial track record of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which has over 3.2 billion daily active users across the platforms it owns and was able to grow twice as fast as rival Alphabet in the digital ad market space in the second quarter, has earned bullish calls from Wall Street. Investment bank UBS has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $635.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\n\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\n\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\n\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\n\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\n\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\n\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations.\n\n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\" A sign is displayed on a Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\n\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\n\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\n\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\n\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024.\n\nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, Ned Davis's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is This Unstoppable AI Stock The Next Big Stock Split?",
        "content": "Stock splits are all the rage this summer with several high-profile companies choosing to execute the move. Nvidia probably attracted the most attention as it was the hottest stock on the market well before its split, but other big names like Chipotle and Broadcom joined in on the fun.\n\nWhy? Stock splits, in this case forward stock splits, happen when a company's share price gets to a level that makes it difficult for a significant portion of the market to buy in. In other words, it's too expensive for the average Joe. The company issues stockholders more stock and proportionally reduces the price at which each share trades.\n\nSo in the end, you have more shares, but the total value of all your investments hasn't changed because the shares cost less. However, even though the value in theory doesn't change, more often than not a forward split is followed by positive movement in the stock price. They tend to be good news for investors.\n\nSo who might be next? Well, it's impossible to know for sure, but there's one artificial intelligence (AI) company that I think could split its stock sooner rather than later.\n\nMeta is riding high on huge earnings after delivering big time\n\nA far cry from its beginnings as \"The Facebook,\" Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) evolved dramatically over the years into the global social media powerhouse it is today. With 3.27 billion daily active users, Meta is ingrained in the lives of a significant portion of the world.\n\nThe company just released monster earnings for Q2 2024, beating Wall Street's already healthy expectations. The company posted 22% year-over-year growth in revenue and a whopping 73% jump in earnings per share.\n\nLots of different factors went into it. The company is much leaner these days, following layoffs in the last year that reduced the headcount and overhead. Revenue growth, though, comes from the continued growth of Meta's user base and the frequency and price of its ads. Meta's entire bottom line is driven by advertising, at least at this point. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is continuing to double down on his metaverse play -- we'll see how that plays out. The company served 10% more ads while charging 10% more for the service.\n\nAdvertisers love Meta's apps because people who use them are extremely engaged. Furthermore, Meta began incorporating AI into its algorithms, serving ads in an even more effective manner and serving more targeted content to users who keep them using the apps.\n\nMeta's stock looks ripe for a split\n\nWhen the earnings were released, the company's stock jumped nearly 5% the next day and another 8% since. Now around $530 a share, it is the most expensive stock by price in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" It is also the only one that has yet to split its stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is no set price at which companies decide to pull the trigger. Nvidia's stock was trading around $1,200 when it split; Alphabet's was trading around $2,700. Some companies do it at a much lower price, though. The last time Apple split its stock it was trading just shy of $500. Meta's current $530 is more than enough to justify a split and considering the move's popularity as of late, I think there is a solid chance it could happen in the near future.\n\nStock splits are not a reason to buy a stock, however. Meta's fundamentals make it a stock that you should have in your portfolio. It is delivering where it needs to consistently while investing money into the future. And even if Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse doesn't pan out, the company is still in a strong position to succeed.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AMD (AMD)\n\nAMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9bn (£3.77bn) cash and stock transaction, as the chip company seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34bn in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker said ZT Systems, will help it \"deliver leadership AI training and inferencing solutions\" and will also help \"cloud and enterprise customers significantly accelerate the deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale\". ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers” such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).\n\nRead more: Wage growth likely to trigger next rise in triple lock state pension\n\nAMD has funnelled more than $1bn into expanding its artificial intelligence ecosystem and strengthening its AI software capabilities over the last 12 months, in addition to its research and development investments, the company said.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW)\n\nShares in the cybersecurity firm were higher in pre-market trading after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nPalo Alto reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $2.18bn, up 12% from the year-ago period and slightly above analysts' estimates. Net income was $357.7m or $1.01 per share, gaining from the year prior and ahead of projections.\n\nFor the full year of fiscal 2024, revenue and net income were stronger than analysts expected at $8.03bn and $2.58bn, respectively.\n\nThe firm expects revenue between $9.1bn and $9.15bn, up between 12% and 13% year-over-year in line with estimates of $9.11bn.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenue to grow between 12% and 13% to between $2.1bn and $2.13bn, compared to estimates of $2.11bn.\n\n\"We finished off the year with strong execution on our platformisation strategy,\" Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora said, adding that \"as we look forward to fiscal year 2025 and beyond, we are focused on scaling our Next-Generation Security business through continued innovation and execution\".\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nMedia executive Edgar Bronfman Jr on Monday submitted a $4.3bn bid for acquiring National Amusements, the company that holds a controlling interest in entertainment giant Paramount Global, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBronfman's offer includes $2.4bn in debt and equity for National Amusements. He also would contribute $1.5bn to Paramount's balance sheet, which could be used to pay down.\n\nHis bid comes over a month after Redstone entered a deal with David Ellison’s Skydance Global, which will merge Paramount with Skydance and create a new company with Ellison at the helm.\n\nRead more: UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch among those missing in Sicily yacht disaster\n\nThat agreement contained a 45-day \"go-shop period\" that allowed Paramount to solicit and evaluate other offers. That period ends on 21 August, but can be extended.\n\nBronfman’s offer potentially complicates Paramount’s fate, especially as the Skydance merger was reached after years of negotiations with different parties. The bid adds $400m to cover a breakup fee to end a rival deal.\n\nA special committee of Paramount's board is expected to meet Wednesday to determine whether Bronfman's offer has a reasonable probability of succeeding.\n\nAntofagasta (ANTO.L)\n\nAntofagasta’s pretax profit declined in line with market expectations in the first six months of the year, when strong commodity prices offset lower sales volumes.\n\nThe Chilean copper miner said its pretax profit fell 7% to $712.6m in the half-year from $764.5m in the same period last year. This is still above the consensus forecast of $710.6m.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the first six months of the year rose to $1.39bn from $1.33bn last year.\n\nThe company saw increased depreciation and amortisation, mainly due to the start of depreciating the assets at the Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion project, which is now in operation.\n\nLooking ahead, the miner reaffirmed full-year production guidance for output to be at the lower end of the 670,000-710,000 tonne range.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): This AI Stock Is Trending Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\n\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm recently posted earnings that beat analyst expectations on top and bottom lines and reiterated that capex on AI would continue to increase in the coming months. The firm projects 2024 capital expenditures coming in at $37 billion to $40 billion, up from previous estimates of $35 billion to $40 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors recently that Meta AI was on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\n\nAnalysts at investment advisory Barclays believe that investors are mis-modeling the hidden costs of AI spend to around 5% of the EPS. However, the advisory maintained an Overweight rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock with a price target of $520, underlining that even though the present outlook on AI was bullish, the risks associated with higher capex on AI would not be fully realized before the latter part of 2025 and early 2026.\n\nOverall META ranks 4th on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nWhy This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDifferent than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nMETA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of B. Earnings are expected to grow 43% year-over-year for the current fiscal year, with sales growth of 19.6%.\n\n15 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.75 to $21.27 per share. META also boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.6%.\n\nMeta Platforms is also cash rich. The company has generated cash flow growth of 13.7%, and is expected to report cash flow expansion of 42.7% in 2024.\n\nWith solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, META should be on investors' short lists.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 19, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nThe Best of the Magnificent 7: NVDA, META, AMZN\n\nLast week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week’s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\n\nLooking back to last week’s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market.\n\nCan Stocks Continue to Rally?\n\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don’t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\n\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying.\n\nThe economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\n\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, if we don’t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\n\nMETA, AMZN and NVDA Boast Incredible Earnings Growth\n\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\n\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\n\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\n\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\n\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Prediction: These \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Will Remain Excellent AI Buys, Despite the Sell-Off",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated investors since ChatGPT burst onto the scene with its viral popularity in early 2023. Since then, big technology companies, often called the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, have duked it out with massive AI investments and rising growth expectations that carried the broader stock market to new highs.\n\nLately, however, volatility crept back into the markets, and many of these highfliers have sold off from their highs.\n\nRemember that volatility is a feature of investing, not a bug. Nobody knows what stock prices will do in the short term, but the sell-off could be a great long-term buying opportunity for the right stocks.\n\nWhich Magnificent Seven stocks should investors focus on? Here's a prediction: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) will emerge as the AI stocks everyone wishes they bought during this sell-off.\n\nHere is why.\n\nMeta has the inside track on the AI race\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms has arguably everything a company needs to build a dominant business around artificial intelligence (AI). You need a ton of data to train AI models, and Meta has tons of first-party data on the 3.27 billion people who log on to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Threads daily.\n\nAI models require tons of computing power. Nvidia has enjoyed tremendous success as the go-to supplier for AI chips. Meta has accumulated nearly 600,000 of Nvidia's flagship H100 GPUs and is designing its own custom chip.\n\nLastly, Meta has developed its own AI models. Llama is Meta's large language model, which it's implementing throughout its apps and making available to other developers to build on. Add it all up, and Meta is building an AI ecosystem over which it has complete control.\n\nNot many AI technology companies can do it all like Meta can. For example, Nvidia's chips serve a specific purpose in AI: computing. Apple has excellent distribution through iOS devices but sought help from OpenAI's AI models. Alphabet has similar advantages to Meta, but it's facing regulatory scrutiny for its monopoly on internet search.\n\nThe best part about Meta is that it's already a great business that AI makes even better. Meta, already a force in digital advertising, launched AI tools for customers that boost ad effectiveness by helping match ads with their target audiences. Ad impressions grew 10% year over year in Q2, but the price per ad also increased 10%. Meta is already generating $150 billion in annual revenue, and analysts believe it will grow by double digits over the next four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should see any sell-off as a long-term buying opportunity. The stock's valuation already looks reasonable, so investors don't need to be too picky. Shares trade roughly 25 times Meta's estimated 2024 earnings, and analysts believe those profits will grow at an annualized rate of 19% over the next three to five years. The resulting PEG ratio of 1.3 signals the stock is borderline cheap for its expected earnings growth, so this is a dip worth buying.\n\nAI demand will grow Microsoft's cloud business\n\nMicrosoft is seemingly everywhere in technology, and AI is no different. The company is planting deep AI roots, including its exclusive partnership with OpenAI, its cloud platform Azure to meet AI's computing needs, and mission-critical enterprise software that gives Microsoft direct access to millions of customers worldwide. The cloud is already Microsoft's most significant and fastest-growing business unit, and AI could continue fueling rampant growth.\n\nMicrosoft's close ties to OpenAI include funneling all its computing through Azure. In other words, anyone who uses OpenAI's products is technically powering those applications through Azure.\n\nThat growth is already trickling through to Microsoft's cloud business. Due to AI demand, management reported that Azure's year-over-year growth exceeded Wall Street's expectations in Q2. Management noted on the call that it would have grown more, but there was more AI demand than available computing capacity. Microsoft is aggressively investing in data centers and AI chips to increase that capacity, which should translate to more revenue and earnings over the coming years. Strong AI execution could help push Azure closer to Amazon's AWS in the global market. AWS is the leading cloud, but Azure's market share grew to 25% in Q1, an all-time high.\n\nMicrosoft's AI positioning and reputation as a blue chip technology stock have earned shares a hefty price tag. The stock's forward P/E ratio of 32 is a bit high for a business that analysts estimate will grow earnings at an annualized rate of 15% over the next several years. A high-quality company like Microsoft can stay expensive for a long time because most investors know and appreciate just how great a stock it is. The sell-off would be a great chance to scoop up shares at a fair price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Stock Sell-Off: 3 AI Winners to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "This summer has seen an abrupt correction in most stocks, including many artificial intelligence (AI) tech winners that outperformed in the first half of the year. Fears over the economy have sent just about all stocks down since mid-July.\n\nHowever, even if there is an economic downturn, AI investment should continue. And if we see a slower economy, that should lead to lower interest rates, which should keep up valuations of technology growth stocks.\n\nThat means stocks poised to benefit from AI could make for excellent buys or adds on the marketwide dip, like these three leaders.\n\nBroadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) CEO Hock Tan has done a masterful job of executing a growth-via-acquisition strategy, targeting dominant franchises in specific niche technologies. And two specific technologies in Broadcom's chip portfolio have taken off with AI.\n\nThese include Broadcom's dominant switching and routing Tomahawk and Jericho chipsets, which are seeing hypergrowth due to the high data transport requirements of AI.\n\nThe second AI business is custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), which are used by both Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to make their own custom AI accelerators. Recently, Broadcom claimed a third major ASIC customer for AI accelerators, which some analysts suspect is Tik Tok parent Bytedance.\n\nThese two AI businesses have absolutely exploded, growing from just over $4.2 billion last year to a projected $11 billion-plus this fiscal year, which ends in October. In addition, Broadcom has other highly profitable franchises, such as supplying Wi-Fi and bluetooth chips for the iPhone.\n\nIn addition to chips, Broadcom's recent acquisition of software giant VMware is turning out to be a smashing success. Folding the virtualization software giant into its business, Broadcom has been able to slash costs and accelerate revenue, greatly boosting VMware's profits.\n\nWith its business now nearly evenly split between software and hardware -- a rarity among large tech stocks -- Tan can now hunt either hardware or software companies for his next acquisition. In the fast-evolving AI space, that's an advantageous position to be in.\n\nDown about 15% from its highs and trading at just 25 times forward earnings, Broadcom is a solid AI pick to buy on the dip.\n\nASML Holding\n\nAnother AI winner is ASML Holding(NASDAQ: ASML), which is in the fortunate position of having a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology. EUV is necessary for making all leading-edge semiconductors today, and is now being used in the production of advanced DRAM memory -- also crucial in AI systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of its competitive advantage, ASML never really trades \"cheaply,\" but down 23% off its recent highs, this could be a good moment to scoop up shares.\n\nASML's second-quarter results, while beating expectations, may have disappointed some hoping for more near-term growth. But ASML's sales can be lumpy. Management has always pointed to 2024 as a pause year in growth, before a big year likely coming in 2025.\n\nLast year, the rest of the chip sector was still mired in a post-COVID slump, except for AI. Yet this year, AI is still growing like gangbusters and now makes up a larger part of the industry. Meanwhile, the AI revolution should grow chip content in more devices, such as AI-enabled PCs and smartphones. That should boost industrywide growth into 2025.\n\nThere has been recent evidence of a strong pickup in chip demand. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the largest foundry for leading-edge chips and ASML's biggest customer, just reported July revenue up a stunning 44.7% compared with last year, and year-to-date revenue up 30.5%.\n\nWith such fast growth, TSMC will likely turn on the spending soon, and that should mean more revenue for ASML, making it a strong pickup on this dip. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nNo matter which GPU vendor wins out for advanced AI applications, future AI GPUs will likely need to be liquid-cooled in a server rack. That's a tricky proposition though, as direct liquid cooling (DLC) technology has been an expensive and cumbersome affair to date, which is why 99% of all data centers were air-cooled coming into 2024.\n\nHowever, the massive electricity requirements of AI are now forcing the hands of data center operators to adopt DLC. And the server maker that has been out in front of this trend is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nSuper Micro missed earnings estimates last quarter, and the stock plunged accordingly. It's now down 56% from all-time highs set back in March, even though the stock is also still up 100% since the beginning of 2024.\n\nBut looking under the hood, the reasons for the earnings miss weren't so concerning. Super Micro already has a working DLC server product, and AI customers are clamoring for it. The demand was so great that management had to pay for expedited shipping costs for liquid cooling components, which took a bite out of margins. The supply constraints also pushed $800 million in revenue from the June-ended to the September-ended quarter.\n\nDespite the shortage, CEO Charles Liang estimated that Super Micro shipped 1,000 liquid-cooled racks in June and July, accounting for about 15% of all data center deployments, and \"at least\" 70% to 80% of all DLC servers globally, dominating this nascent market.\n\nThose all seem like valid reasons for the quarter's miss, especially in light of Super Micro's recent track record of trouncing expectations. Meanwhile, management projects a gradual improvement in the company's gross margins back into the 14% to 17% target range by the end of the year.\n\nSuper Micro's management also gave blowout guidance of $26 billion to $30 billion in revenue for the year ahead, relative to the near-$15 billion it made in the 12 months ending in June. And Super Micro has a history of giving conservative guidance. For instance, one year ago, Super Micro forecast $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024, which ended in June. The company wound up doing 50% more than that.\n\nThis indicates Super Micro could vastly outperform in terms of revenue, which could help 2025 earnings exceed expectations even with some margin compression. Given that the stock only trades around 16 times what could be conservative earnings forecasts for the year ahead, it's a buy on this dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg gave his ex-Facebook engineer startup advice at 2 a.m. over chess—now she’s a founder with over $8.5 million raised in funding",
        "content": "When Sophie Novati landed her first job as an engineering intern at Facebook in 2011, the social media giant was firmly in its “move fast and break things” era.\n\n“The energy was buzzing early Facebook,” the now tech entrepreneur recalls to Fortune. “There were so many people just trying to build and ship cool stuff.”\n\n“It honestly almost felt like it was college,” she adds. “People were literally sleeping at the office… It felt like everyone that I was there with were just all buddies and hanging out. Everyone was working very hard. But it felt like the dorm room.”\n\nA few years later, Novati left Facebook (now Meta) to join the platform Nextdoor as its second iOS engineer hire. The 33-year-old helped build it from the ground up before founding her own firm, Formation in 2019.\n\nThe job placement company offers various subscription packages and programs to help engineers secure work or increase their earning potential. For a fee (ranging from $2,500 to $20,000), job seekers can get access to unlimited resume reviews, negotiation coaching, mentoring, mock interviews, exam drills and more.\n\nHaving been Facebook's de facto inclusivity lead in the engineering department, she says she was inspired to found Formation and help remove barriers to entry.\n\n“At Facebook and Nextdoor, I was probably one of 15 people who was a woman and that ratio just didn't feel right.”\n\nNow, over 1,300 job seekers have enlisted Formation’s help to get a seat at the table—on average, they’ve landed a $127,286 pay rise in the process, according to the company.\n\nBut, Novati says, Formation’s success today is partly due to a late-night chess lesson from her former boss, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nZuckerberg's advice over chess\n\nIt was 2am on one night in 2011 when Zuckerberg was “hanging out with all the interns,” including playing a couple of chess matches with Novati (who claims she won).\n\n“That was the vibe of the company at the time,” Novati says, adding that it was the first time she was able to ask him the million-dollar question: How’s the social network going to make any money?\n\n“Facebook was growing users at a pace that no one's seen before,” she adds. “But it couldn't make any money.”\n\nOf course, today, Facebook—or Meta—is a $1.3 trillion social media giant with Instagram and WhatsApp under its wing. However, up until 2012, the year Facebook went public, its mobile app didn't actually make money.\n\nIt didn't feature ads and the move to incorporate them was considered risky.\n\nIn the end, the company was able to turn likes and shares into profit, by turning its users into the product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe \"aggressive\" strategy lifted Facebook from \"no meaningful revenue\" to $153 million in mobile ads, The Atlantic reported at the time.\n\n“His response to me was, if you can figure out a way to capture people's valuable attention, you can always figure out how to turn that into money later,” Novati recalls.\n\n“What he was really focused on building is figuring out how to deliver value to people,” she adds. “Later on, you can always turn that value into dollars.”\n\nIt’s why Novati has always been hyper-focused on promoting how Formation is adding value to engineers' lives instead of worrying about its list of clients or sign-up rates.\n\n“We look at increase in compensation as our number one metric,” she explains.\n\n“College in the U.S. costs on average around $100k for 4 years. The average compensation for people who go through versus those who do not is about $20km. So people are paying $100k for $20k value—we are the flip here, we're helping people make $127k more and we're charging $10-15k.”\n\n“It's pretty crazy that people are making over $100k more as a result of going through a program,” she boasts.\n\nSo far, Zuckerberg’s ethos has been on the money.\n\nAccording to Novati, Formation has raised over $8.5 million in funding and is working with the likes of Netflix, Google, Twitch, Dropbox, Adobe and her old employer Meta among others.\n\n\"There's still a lot more that we can do to better capture the value that we're creating,\" Novati concludes.\n\nBut for now, her attention remains \"on getting people into these top jobs and significantly improving the trajectories of their career.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): The Best Magnificent Seven Stock?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is arguably the best Magnificent Seven stock right now and presents a buying opportunity, in my view. The social media company’s ad revenue and user base continue to grow, and the valuation leaves plenty of room for error. The recent earnings report and long-term performance make me bullish on the stock.\n\nNet Income Surges Without Job Cuts\n\nMeta Platforms’ net income has been soaring in recent quarters, which has prompted the social media giant to offer its first quarterly dividend this year. Profits continued in that direction, with a 73% year-over-year increase in the second quarter.\n\nEfficiency has been a key contributor to the company’s rising profits. That’s code for firing more employees, but significant cuts weren’t present in this quarter. While Q1 2024 featured a 10% year-over-year decline in headcount, the second quarter only saw a 1% year-over-year decline in this area.\n\nMeta Platforms’ ability to retain workers while delivering robust net income growth can position it well in the future. A downside to firing many workers is the loss of talent and the difficulties of replacing people who left. Seeing that downside less present in the second quarter while net income continued to soar is an encouraging development.\n\nDaily Active Users Continue to Increase\n\nFacebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are three of the top social media platforms — all owned by Meta. Even though these platforms are well-known, they continue to attract new users. Meta Platforms reported a 7% year-over-year increase in daily active users across its family of apps. As a result of high user growth, the company closed out the quarter with 3.27 billion daily active users.\n\nA rising user base allows Meta Platforms to provide more ad placements for corporations, small businesses, and influencers. Those extra ad spots can help Meta Platforms deliver elevated revenue growth for several years.\n\nA Good Valuation\n\nA stock’s valuation is a key component of the analysis after considering the fundamentals. Meta Platforms certainly delivers with a 27.5x P/E ratio. There are many companies with a similar valuation that aren’t delivering 73% year-over-year net income growth for their investors.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) is the only Magnificent Seven stock that trades at a lower valuation, and its year-over-year net income growth pales in comparison to Meta Platforms. Furthermore, Facebook’s parent company should continue to benefit from rising revenue and profits, which should bring down the P/E ratio even more.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also good to note that Meta Platforms’ net income growth has outpaced its year-to-date stock gains. Meta Platforms stock is up 49% year-to-date, which is supported by rising profits.\n\nA Dividend Growth Story in the Works\n\nMeta Platforms isn’t only catering to growth investors. The company’s recent dividend program now makes it an appealing pick for dividend growth investors. While Meta Platforms only has a 0.37% yield, it has the financial growth and cash position to support an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for many years.\n\nFor instance, Meta Platforms closed out the quarter with $58.08 billion in cash. It has plenty of resources to support dividend hikes over time, but Meta Platforms doesn’t even have to tap into those reserves for the dividend program.\n\nThe company distributed $1.27 billion to its investors as dividend payments this quarter. During the same quarter, Meta Platforms allocated $6.32 billion toward its stock buyback. Shifting some of the buyback funds to dividend distributions is sufficient to hike the dividend by at least 10% per year for several years, but it’s better for tax purposes that the capital goes toward stock buybacks.\n\nWhile we’ve covered Meta Platforms’ net income growth rate, the company’s total GAAP profit came in at $13.5 billion this quarter. That’s enough cash to support elevated dividends in the years ahead. Thus, Meta Platforms has the making of a dividend growth stock that outperforms the market while raising its dividend considerably over the years. That setup should attract many dividend investors as it becomes more apparent.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMeta Platforms is currently rated as a Strong Buy on TipRanks based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average META stock price target suggests 4.2% upside from current levels, but that’s a reflection of Meta Platforms’ recent stock gains. The highest price target of $645 per share, which was assigned today, suggests that the stock can gain an additional 22% from current levels.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line on Meta Platforms Stock\n\nMeta Platforms has delivered incredible revenue and net income growth for its investors in recent quarters. Further, expanding profit margins have trimmed the stock’s P/E ratio, even as it has continued to outperform the market. Additionally, Meta Platforms continues to grow its user base, which will support higher revenue in the future.\n\nIt was encouraging to see Meta Platforms grow its net income by 73% year-over-year while retaining most of its employees. It’s a sign that the company doesn’t have to rely on job cuts to generate more profits. Many analysts believe Meta Platforms can continue to deliver gains for long-term investors, and I am in agreement with them.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This controversial California AI bill was amended to quell Silicon Valley fears. Here's what changed",
        "content": "A controversial bill that seeks to protect Californians from artificial intelligence-driven catastrophes has caused uproar in the tech industry. This week, the legislation passed a key committee but with amendments to make it more palatable to Silicon Valley.\n\nSB 1047, from state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), is set to go to the state Assembly floor later this month. If it passes the Legislature, Gov. Gavin Newsom will have to decide whether to sign or veto the groundbreaking legislation.\n\nThe bill's backers say it will create guardrails to prevent rapidly advancing AI models from causing disastrous incidents, such as shutting down the power grid without warning. They worry that the technology is developing faster than its human creators can control.\n\nLawmakers aim to incentive developers to handle the technology responsibly and empower the state's attorney general to impose penalties in the event of imminent threat or harm. The legislation also requires developers to be able to turn off the AI models they control directly if things go awry.\n\nBut some tech companies, such as Facebook owner Meta Platforms, and politicians including influential U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont), say the bill would stifle innovation. Some critics say it focuses on apocalyptic, far-off scenarios, rather than the more immediate concerns such as privacy and misinformation, though there are other bills that address these matters.\n\nSB 1047 is one of roughly 50 AI-related bills that have been brought up in the state Legislature, as worries have grown about the technology's effects on jobs, disinformation and public safety. As politicians work to create new laws to put guardrails on the fast-growing industry, some companies and talent are suing AI companies in hopes that courts can set ground rules.\n\nWiener, who represents San Francisco — the home of AI startups OpenAI and Anthropic — has been in the middle of the debate.\n\nOn Thursday, he made significant changes to his bill that some believe weaken the legislation while making it more likely for the Assembly to pass.\n\nThe amendments removed a perjury penalty from the bill and changed the legal standard for developers regarding the safety of their advanced AI models.\n\nAdditionally, a plan to create a new government entity, which would have been called the Frontier Model Division, is no longer in the works. Under the original text, the bill would have required developers to submit their safety measures to the newly created division. In the new version, developers would submit those safety measures to the attorney general.\n\n\"I do think some of those changes might make it more likely to pass,\" said Christian Grose, a USC political science and public policy professor.\n\nSome tech players support the bill, including the Center for AI Safety and Geoffrey Hinton, who is considered a \"godfather of AI.\" Others, though, worry that it could damage a booming California industry.\n\nEight California House members — Khanna, Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), Anna G. Eshoo (D-Menlo Park), Scott Peters (D-San Diego), Tony Cárdenas (D-Pacoima), Ami Bera (D-Elk Grove), Nanette Diaz Barragan (D-San Pedro) and Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) — wrote a letter to Newsom on Thursday encouraging him to veto the bill if it passes the state Assembly.\n\n\"[Wiener] really is cross pressured in San Francisco between people who are experts in this area, who have been telling him and others in California that AI can be dangerous if we don't regulate it and then those whose paychecks, their cutting edge research, is from AI,\" Grose said. \"This could be a real flash point for him, both pro and con, for his career.\"\n\nRead more:California lawmakers are trying to regulate AI before it's too late. Here's how\n\nSome tech giants say they are open to regulation but disagree with Wiener's approach.\n\n\"We are aligned with the way (Wiener) describes the bill and the goals that he has, but we remain concerned about the impact of the bill on AI innovation, particularly in California, and particularly on open source innovation,\" Kevin McKinley, Meta's state policy manager, said in a meeting with L.A. Times editorial board members last week.\n\nMeta is one of the companies with open source AI models called Llama, which allows developers to build on top of it for their own products. Meta released Llama 3 in April and there have already been 20 million downloads, the tech giant said.\n\nMeta declined to discuss the new amendments. Last week, McKinley said SB 1047 is \"actually a really hard bill to red line and fix.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom said his office does not typically comment on pending legislation.\n\n\"The Governor will evaluate this bill on its merits should it reach his desk,\" spokesperson Izzy Gardon wrote in an email.\n\nRead more:AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace?\n\nSan Francisco AI startup Anthropic, which is known for its AI assistant Claude, signaled it could support the bill if it was amended. In a July 23 letter to Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Anthropic's state and local policy lead Hank Dempsey proposed changes including shifting the bill to focus on holding companies responsible for causing catastrophes rather than pre-harm enforcement.\n\nRead more:Scarlett Johansson also thinks OpenAI's new voice sounds like her. She's not happy about it\n\nWiener said the amendments took Anthropic's concerns into account.\n\n“We can advance both innovation and safety,\" Wiener said in a statement. \"The two are not mutually exclusive.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the amendments will change Anthropic's position on the bill. On Thursday, Anthropic said in a statement that it would review the new \"bill language as it becomes available.\"\n\nRussell Wald, deputy director at Stanford University's HAI, which aims to advance AI research and policy, said he still opposes the bill.\n\n\"Recent amendments appear to be more about optics than substance,\" Wald said in a statement. \"It looks less controversial to appease a couple of leading AI companies but does little to address real concerns from academic institutions and open-source communities.\"\n\nIt is a fine balance for lawmakers that are trying to weigh concerns about AI while also supporting the state's tech sector.\n\n“What a lot of us are trying to do is figure out a regulatory environment that allows for some of those guardrails to exist while not stifling innovation and the economic growth that comes with AI,\" Wicks said after Thursday's committee meeting.\n\nTimes staff writer Anabel Sosa contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:Washed Out's new music video was created with AI.

        "title": "The worst performing investment funds so far this year",
        "content": "Investors have over £53bn across funds that have consistently underperformed, with managers with low or zero exposure to AI-themed stocks and the energy sector lagging.\n\nGlobal equity funds were the most prominent offenders in Bestinvest’s latest ‘Spot the Dog’ report, with 44 funds making the list, a slight improvement from 51 earlier in the year. A third of these global funds are focused on sustainable investing, missing out on gains from the surge in oil and gas stocks.\n\nUK equity funds also featured prominently, with 44 funds flagged, a significant increase from 12 a year ago. Ethical and sustainable funds make up about a quarter of these underperformers, largely due to their lack of exposure to the UK's energy and commodities sectors.\n\nThe report found 137 equity investment funds holding £53.42bn consistently underperformed. You can read the full list here.\n\nThe number of ‘dog funds’ has dropped by 9% since the start of the year, when 151 funds made the list. However, it remains significantly higher than the 56 funds flagged only a year ago.\n\nThe value of assets tied up in these underachieving funds has also fallen sharply, dropping to £53.42 billion—44% less than the £95.26bn reported in the previous edition, primarily due to a few large funds narrowly avoiding the list.\n\nRead more: Where to invest your money when interest rates are falling\n\nTo make it into the list, a fund must have underperformed compared to the market it invests in by 5% or more over a three-year period.\n\nA second filter is that the fund must also have underperformed in three successive 12-month periods in a row.\n\nFund performance can falter for various reasons, ranging from poor decision-making to investment strategies falling out of favour with current market trends. This issue is particularly pressing as investors question why so many funds continue to lag behind their benchmarks, especially given the recent boom in AI, which has invigorated the US stock market and global equities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the rally has been driven by a narrow group of US megacap companies benefiting from AI, making it challenging for fund managers who lack exposure to these few giants to keep up.\n\nThe AI-driven surge in select stocks fails to capture the broader equity market's struggles over the past three years. A notable trend, consistent with previous reports, is the high representation of ESG and ethical funds among the underperformers. These funds account for a fifth of the Spot the Dog list, reflecting the unexpected rise in oil and gas prices due to post-pandemic supply chain issues and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRead more: Investors flock to tech funds amid AI race\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, said: “The high number of sustainable or responsible funds in the latest Spot the Dog report partly reflects the strong performance of oil and gas stocks in 2021-22. Over the three-year period covered, the MSCI World Energy Index delivered a total return of 98% in GBP, compared to the MSCI World Index's 28%. Conversely, the alternative and renewable energy market has struggled, with the MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index declining by 38% over the same period.”\n\nHollands anticipates a reduction in ESG funds on the list in future reports as the impact of surging energy stocks fades. He also noted the dominance of companies like NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT)—dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\"—which have driven market performance recently. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index has surged 42% over the past year, with these companies now making up a significant portion of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and MSCI World indices.\n\nRead more: Best UK savings accounts offering above inflation rates\n\nThe previous edition of the report included two of Britain's most prominent funds—Terry Smith's Fundsmith Equity and Nick Train's WS Lindsell Train UK Equity—but both have now dropped off the list. Despite this, the presence of large funds remains a concern, with ten funds over £1 billion in size accounting for £26.81bn, or half of the assets in underperforming funds.\n\nHollands said: “The Spot the Dog report is a timely reminder for investors to regularly review their portfolios. While the report highlights underperforming funds, it also stresses the importance of monitoring investments and considering whether changes are needed.\n\n\"Identifying whether a fund is struggling due to short-term challenges or more deep-rooted issues is crucial for investors deciding whether to hold or sell.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Lawmakers accuse Meta of approving online ads for cocaine and ecstasy",
        "content": "On Thursday, a coalition of 19 Democratic and Republican lawmakers sent an open letter to Meta outlining concerns that the company was failing to prevent “blatant” advertisements for illicit drugs on its platforms. Published reports this year revealed that federal prosecutors have been probing whether Meta has profited indirectly from drug sales on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nThe letter came on the heels of a rare scene earlier this year, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood up in a Senate hearing regarding child safety on social media platforms, turned around, and apologized to a gallery of parents whose children had been victims of online abuse. Some of the children had committed suicide.\n\n“At a hearing before the U.S. Senate…you personally apologized to the parents of children who have died following their exposure to exploitation, harassment, and drugs online,” the letter states. “Despite this and your company’s own Community Standards, Meta approved ads throughout 2024 that displayed obvious drug sales, including ‘packages of OxyContin and piles of unidentified, brightly colored pills,’ as well as MDMA, ecstasy, cocaine, and others.”\n\nThe legislators include House minority whip Rep. Lori Trahan (D-Mass.), and Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas), who is also vice chair of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and technology. They were outraged over the fact that, rather than being user-generated content such as listings on Facebook Marketplace, the drug ads appeared to be promoted by Meta itself.\n\n“What is particularly egregious about this instance is that this was not user generated content on the dark web or on private social media pages,” they wrote. “But rather they were advertisements approved and monetized by Meta.”\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment, but in a statement to CNBC, the company said its systems reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating Meta’s drug policies.\n\n“Drug dealers are criminals who work across platforms and communities, which is why we work with law enforcement to help combat this activity,” they said. “We continue to invest resources and further improve our enforcement on this kind of content.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in March that federal prosecutors were investigating whether Meta had facilitated or profited from the sale of illicit drugs on Instagram and Facebook. At the time, a spokesperson for the company told the Journal that Meta was proactively cooperating with law enforcement authorities to limit the sale and distribution of illegal products.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet just a few months later, in July, the Journal published another report showing that Meta’s platforms were running “dozens of ads marketing illegal substances such as cocaine and prescription opioids.”\n\nOn the same day, the Tech Transparency Project, a watchdog group covering major technology companies, reported an investigation detailing over 450 ads running on Instagram and Facebook that were selling pharmaceutical and other drugs, including images of “piles of pills and powders, or bricks of cocaine,” often directing users to send the sellers encrypted messages on WhatsApp or Telegram.\n\n“Meta appears to have continued to shirk its social responsibility and defy its own community guidelines,” lawmakers wrote. “Protecting users online, especially children and teenagers, is one of our top priorities. We are continuously concerned that Meta is not up to the task and this dereliction of duty needs to be addressed.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Best of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, META, AMZN)",
        "content": "Last week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week’s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\n\nLooking back to last week’s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nCan Stocks Continue to Rally?\n\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don’t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\n\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying. The economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\n\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\n\nThus, if we don’t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\n\nStory continues EquityClcck\n\nImage Source: EquityClcck\n\nMETA, AMZN and NVDA Boast Incredible Earnings Growth\n\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\n\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\n\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\n\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\n\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\n\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\n\nIs This 1 Momentum Stock a Screaming Buy Right Now?\n\nFor momentum investors, upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook take precedent, so they'll want to zero in on the Momentum Style Score. This Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\n\nMETA boasts a Momentum Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Meta Platforms has seen some interesting price action recently; the stock is up 5.4% over the past one week and up 12.9% over the past four weeks. And in the last one-year period, META has gained 88.5%. As for the stock's trading volume, 17,081,228 shares on average were traded over the last 20 days.\n\nMomentum investors don't just pay attention to price changes; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. 15 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.75 to $21.27 per share. META boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.6%.\n\nInvestors should take the time to consider META for their portfolios due to its solid Zacks Ranks, notable earnings metrics, and impressive Momentum and VGM Style Scores.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this social media company have returned +12.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.6%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43%. This estimate has changed +5.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.03 indicates a change of +13% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.35 billion and $183.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.6% and +14%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "What business can do to fight misinformation",
        "content": "Good morning.\n\nDays after Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016, Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook announced that it had bought a media-tracking and self-described “social-listening” tool called CrowdTangle. The company later touted the tool as part of its efforts to “protect the 2020 election,” announcing that it had provided access to election boards and secretaries of state nationwide “to help them quickly identify misinformation, voter interference and suppression.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the company now known as Meta Platforms shut down CrowdTangle, despite pleas from journalists and watchdog groups to keep the tool running through January to fight disinformation during this year’s upcoming U.S. election. While Meta does police its own platforms, CrowdTangle allowed the rest of us to track the spread of false narratives and see the popularity of inflammatory posts on Facebook. Meta’s alternative, called Meta Content Library, excludes most news organizations and is reportedly not as useful, though Meta says it helps them meet regulatory requirements while meeting privacy standards.\n\nBusiness leaders have a vested interest in combating false information. Along with preserving the integrity and trust that keep societies together, businesses can also be the target of misinformation campaigns, as seen recently with efforts to disrupt the Olympics or defraud employees.\n\nBut the leaders who are best equipped to stop the deluge of disinformation on social platforms aren’t making it easy to get the job done. Far from helping solve the problem, Elon Musk’s posts on the social media platform he purchased, X, are contributing to it: The Center for Countering Digital Hate reports that Musk’s false or misleading claims about the U.S. election have garnered nearly 1.2 billion views this year.\n\nOne tactic to combat this deluge is to put resources into promoting the truth. That’s the approach Steve Ballmer is taking with his new “Just The Facts” video series via his nonprofit site USAFacts. As the former Microsoft CEO and Los Angeles Clippers owner told me earlier this week, the goal of the series is to clarify the facts around “hot button issues for the election,” from jobs to illegal immigration. Along with running the videos on YouTube, he’s paying for airtime on networks like Fox.\n\nBallmer cast himself as the narrator to “get just a little bit more viewership,” he explained. Although he can be a little less animated when explaining immigration than talking about Microsoft or his basketball team, the videos are a compelling, and reassuringly truthful, summary of facts. His goal: “Let's get people educated, at a minimum.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHe’s trying to counteract a problem articulated by Tom Steyer, a prominent climate investor, philanthropist, and Democrat: The fact that we like to be entertained, and tend to gravitate to stories that reinforce our preexisting beliefs. Steyer told a group of us at Fortune that there has been “a huge move from edited news to unedited news, where people get to write authoritatively about things they either know nothing about or [are] absolutely lying about. And there is no teacher at the head of the room to say, ‘Aha, Johnny, that's not true.’”\n\nThis is partly a matter of market forces, Ballmer says: Because the media industry is “under assault financially,” Ballmer says, “things that are provocative are more rewarded than things which are not.” Ballmer hopes that people will change if confronted with the facts and data, both local and national.\n\n“I think we've accomplished a lot,” he told me, “and I'm daunted by what we still need to do.”\n\nMore news below.\n\nDiane Brady\r\ndiane.brady@fortune.com\r\nFollow on LinkedIn\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon was higher in pre-market trading after rising over 4% on Thursday’s session as retail bellwether Walmart good results soothe recession fears across markets.\n\nDespite the momentum, Amazon shares are down 15% from a record high of $201.20 (£155.94) reached in July, leaving many investors wondering if it’s time to buy the stock while it is undervalued.\n\n\"And just like Meta's (META) sell-off post 1Q24, we believe Amazon's recent stock pullback offers a decent entry point with the fundamental story just as strong as pre-earnings, albeit with expectations reset lower,\" Bernstein analysts wrote.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed following boost for UK retail sales\n\nThe research firm expects strong growth for Amazon's operating income and free cash flow despite lower-than-expected sales for the second quarter.\n\n\"The operating income inflection story remains intact with further contribution from robust Amazon Web Services growth, advertising re-acceleration in (second half of 2024) from Prime Video ad ramp, and steady retail margin expansion while prioritising gross profits,\" the note said.\n\nAmazon has said it has plans to boost spending on AI-related infrastructure for its Amazon Web Services cloud division.\n\nJD.com (JD)\n\nShares in JD.com were up 3% in pre-market trading after its quarterly profit nearly doubled despite intensifying competition.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce platform’s June-quarter net income rose 92% from a year ago to 12.64bn Chinese yuan (£1.31bn/$1.7bn), helped by price cuts that lured cost-conscious consumers to its platform.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nJD.com said revenue grew 1.2% to 291.4bn yuan, or $40.7bn. That was ahead of estimates of 291bn yuan, according to FactSet.\n\n“We continued to enhance price competitiveness during the promotional season through our supply chain and disciplined approach, as opposed to reliance on subsidies,” said chief financial officer Ian Su Shan in a statement, adding that gross margins had increased to 15.8% in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBayer (BAYN.DE)\n\nBayer shares have surged after it secured a court victory in the long running legal battle surrounding its Roundup weed killer.\n\nA three-judge panel rejected a claim by David Schaffner, a Pennsylvania man diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in 2006. Schaffner claimed Bayer violated state law by failing to put a cancer warning on Roundup.\n\nRead more: Binance exec insists bitcoin can recover despite 20% drop\n\nThe court ruled that the company could not include the warning in Pennsylvania because of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which requires nationwide uniformity in pesticide labels.\n\nThe stock had fallen about 49% in the last year and more than 70% since Bayer completed the takeover in 2018 of agriculture company Monsanto, which makes Roundup.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nShares in Applied Materials fell over 3% in pre-market trading even as the Santa Clara-based company forecast fourth quarter revenue slightly above Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe pullback appears to be partly a reaction to the sharp rise in the stock earlier in the day, according to Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.\n\n\"Some of the aftermarket pullback is based on how much the stock went up today... the mixed sales report from China and the wide variance in their fourth-quarter forecast,\" Schulman said. \"Some analysts may have been looking for a more robust next-quarter forecast.\"\n\nApplied Materials forecast fourth quarter revenue slightly above Wall Street expectations on Thursday, fuelled by surging demand for its chip-making equipment amid the AI boom.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-powered chips has driven the need for advanced wafer fabrication equipment, essential in chip manufacturing, which is expected to benefit companies like Applied Materials. However, the market's response suggests some lingering caution among investors.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Just Slashed His Positions in These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks. Should You Sell Them, Too?",
        "content": "Few hedge fund managers have been as all-in on artificial intelligence (AI) as David Tepper. His Appaloosa fund's portfolio has been stacked with AI stocks for quite a while.\n\nHowever, the billionaire investor doesn't appear to be as enamored with AI these days. Tepper slashed his positions in several AI stocks in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTepper's top five AI cuts in Q2\n\nEach of Appaloosa's top five holdings has a major focus on AI. However, Tepper reduced his hedge fund's positions in all of them in Q2.\n\nHe sold 750,000 shares of Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA), decreasing Appaloosa's stake in the Chinese internet company by roughly 6.7%. However, Alibaba remains the hedge fund's largest position, making up around 12.2% of its portfolio.\n\nTepper cut Appaloosa's stake in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) by 9.2% with his sale of 353,000 shares of the e-commerce and cloud services leader. This wasn't enough to bump Amazon from its perch as the second-biggest holding for the hedge fund, though.\n\nThe billionaire investor sold more than 15.6% of his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Despite this significant reduction, the tech giant is still Appaloosa's third-largest holding.\n\nAlthough Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) held onto its No. 4 ranking among Appaloosa's biggest positions, the hedge fund owns a lot less of the social media and metaverse company now. Tepper dumped more than 15.6% of Appaloosa's stake in Meta in Q2.\n\nHe also sold 150,000 shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), reducing Appaloosa's stake in the Google parent by more than 7.2%. However, the sale transactions didn't cause Alphabet to lose its spot as the hedge fund's fifth-largest holding.\n\nWhy is Tepper selling these AI stocks?\n\nTepper hasn't stated publicly why he decided to reduce Appaloosa's positions in its top AI stocks. All we can do is speculate about his reasoning.\n\nIt's striking that the hedge fund manager didn't limit his selling to only one or two AI stocks. Tepper reduced Appaloosa's stakes in Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, as well as several other AI stocks.\n\nHe didn't completely throw in the towel on AI stocks, though. For example, Tepper increased his hedge fund's positions in Adobe and ASML Holdings.\n\nPerhaps he was concerned about premium valuations in some cases. However, that can't be true across the board. Alibaba, for example, trades at a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4. Alphabet and Meta stocks don't look overly expensive based on their price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) multiples. Also, some of the stocks Tepper bought in Q2 have higher valuations than some he sold.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaybe the best guess behind why Tepper slashed his positions in most of these five AI stocks is that he wanted to take some profits off the table. With the exception of Alibaba, all the other top AI stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio were up solidly year to date in Q2.\n\nShould you sell them, too?\n\nEvery investor has their own objectives to consider when buying and selling stocks. Just because a famous investor like Tepper is selling his biggest AI stock holdings doesn't mean you should automatically follow suit.\n\nAlibaba should have great long-term prospects offering AI cloud services in China. It's a similar story for Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft in the U.S., Europe, and other key markets.\n\nMeta is using AI to increase the monetization of its social media apps and could have a big opportunity in the business AI arena. I think that all five of the top AI stocks Tepper sold in Q2 could be attractive picks to buy for many long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Does Jim Cramer Remain Optimistic About Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\n\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\n\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\n\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won’t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\n\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\n\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\n\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\n\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing significant growth, with a 19% year-over-year revenue increase and a 75% jump in operating income last quarter. This success is largely fueled by the strong demand for AI services and the ongoing transition of corporate IT infrastructure to the cloud. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s entry into the healthcare market, particularly through Amazon Pharmacy, is showing promising results, with growing consumer adoption and increasing market share.\n\nDespite a recent dip in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s stock price, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic, consistently rating the stock as a \"buy\" and projecting substantial upside. Recent business developments, including securing NBA media rights and a successful Prime Day event, further support Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s strong growth outlook.\n\nJim Cramer explained that investors are hesitant to buy Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) because they are concerned about the potential threat from Meta. They fear that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might catch up to and even surpass Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This concern is well-founded, as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements could pose a significant challenge to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s market position.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:246\n\nJim Cramer points out that skeptics should take notice of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s recent achievements with their computing power. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has rapidly emerged as a leading generative AI platform with Meta AI, which Cramer himself has switched to because of its impressive performance.\n\n\"Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is experiencing impressive financial growth, highlighted by a 22% year-over-year revenue increase and a 73% surge in net income for Q2 2024. This growth is driven by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s disciplined cost management and its substantial investments in AI infrastructure. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is planning capital expenditures between $37 billion and $40 billion this year, including the purchase of 350,000 Nvidia GPUs to strengthen its AI capabilities.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is particularly noteworthy for its cost efficiency and its ability to drive faster innovation through collaboration. As digital advertising spending continues to increase, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, are expected to retain their dominant positions, further boosting the company's growth outlook.\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Cathie Wood’s Favorite AI Stock?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCathie Wood’s flagship fund is continuing to face steep losses amid a broader pullback in technology stocks. Wood’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\n\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\n\nCathie Wood Says “Something Is Changing” and the Fed is Now on “High Alert”\n\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a latest video on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a “cathartic” phase and “something is changing.”\n\n“I do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.”\n\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\n“Interest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.”\n\nCathie Wood’s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter. For this article we scanned the fund’s latest portfolio and picked 11 AI stocks it has positions in. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Cathie Wood’s Favorite AI Stock?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nCathie Wood’s Latest Stake Value: $218,657,942\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Meta Shuts Down Tracking Tool CrowdTangle, Faces Bipartisan Criticism\n\nOn Wednesday, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shut down CrowdTangle, a social media analysis tool used for monitoring trending posts on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nCrowdTangle helped journalists and researchers analyze user engagement, identify key drivers of content spread, and track the virality of political and medical misinformation on social media platforms, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to the report, in July, a bipartisan group of lawmakers requested that CEO Mark Zuckerberg delay CrowdTangle’s shutdown by six months, emphasizing the need for continued access to study the impact of platforms and their algorithms.\n\nThis week, Meta responded that it would proceed with the shutdown due to maintenance difficulties and concerns that the tool no longer provides a representative view of platform activity.\n\nIn separate statements, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, termed Meta’s response as “disappointing,” andRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana added that it “only highlights the need for more oversight and scrutiny of Big Tech.”\n\nNotably, in March, the social media giant disclosed its intention to replace CrowdTangle with the Meta Content Library, limiting access exclusively to academic and nonprofit researchers and excluding most news outlets.\n\nMeta stated that CrowdTangle’s decommissioning followed years of its use in studying the spread of misinformation and causing frustration among its leaders due to reporting that often highlighted problematic content spread.\n\nMeta promised that the Meta Content Library would be an improvement over CrowdTangle with new capabilities, such as measuring content’s reach and accessing public comments data.\n\nRelated: Meta’s Policy Shift Takes A Toll On Instagram Engagement: Report\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the stock via Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (NYSE:FCOM) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).\n\nPrice Action: META shares are up 2.06% at $537.59 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Meta Shuts Down Tracking Tool CrowdTangle, Faces Bipartisan Criticism originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "One Tech Tip: Don't want chatbots using your conversations for AI training? Some let you opt out",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Be careful what you tell a chatbot. Your conversation might be used to improve the artificial intelligence system that it's built on.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT for advice about your embarrassing medical condition, beware that anything you disclose could be used to tweak OpenAI's algorithms that underpin its AI models. The same goes if, for example, you upload a sensitive company report to Google’s Gemini to summarize for a meeting.\n\nIt's no secret that the AI models underpinning popular chatbots have been trained on enormous troves of information scraped from the internet, like blog posts, news articles and social media comments, so they can predict the next word when coming up with a response to your question.\n\nThis training was often done without consent, raising copyright concerns. and, experts say, given the opaque nature of AI models, it's probably too late to remove any of your data that might have been used.\n\nBut what you can do going forward is stop any of your chatbot interactions from being used for AI training. It’s not always possible but some companies give users the option:\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nGoogle keeps your conversations with its Gemini chatbot to train its machine learning systems. For users 18 or older, chats are kept by default for 18 months, though that can be adjusted in settings. Human reviewers can also access the conversations to improve the quality of the generative AI models that power Gemini. Google warns users not to tell Gemini any confidential information or give it any data they don't want a human reviewer to see.\n\nTo opt out of this, go to the Gemini website and click the Activity tab. Click the Turn Off button and from the drop down menu, you can choose to stop recording all future chats or delete all your previous conversations. The company warns that any conversations that have been selected for human review won't be deleted and are stored separately. Whether you choose to turn your activity off or leave it on, Google also says all chats with Gemini will be kept for 72 hours to “provide the service and process any feedback.”\n\nGemini's help page also details the process for iPhone and Android app users.\n\nMeta AI\n\nMeta has an AI chatbot that's been butting into conversations on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, powered by its open-source AI language models. The company says those models are trained on information shared on its platforms including social media posts and photos and caption info, but not your private messages with friends and family. They're also trained on publicly available information scraped from other parts of the web by “third parties.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNot everyone can opt out. People in the 27-nation European Union and the United Kingdom, which have strict privacy regulations, have the right to object to their information being used to train Meta’s AI systems. From the Facebook privacy page, click Other Policies and Articles from the list on the left side, then click the section on generative AI. Scroll down to find a link to a form where you can object.\n\nThere's a box to fill out with additional information to support your request, but no details about what you should say. I wrote that I was exercising my right as a U.K. resident to withdraw consent for my personal information to be used for AI training. I received an email almost instantly saying Meta had reviewed the request and would honor my objection. “This means your request will be applied going forward,\" it said.\n\nPeople in the United States and other countries without national data privacy laws don't have this option.\n\nMeta's privacy hub does link to a form where users can request that their data scraped by third parties not be used to \"develop and improve AI at Meta.” But the company warns it won’t automatically fulfill requests and will review them based on local laws. The process itself is cumbersome, requiring users to provide the chatbot request that produced a response with their personal info and a screenshot of it.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot\n\nThere's no way to option to opt out for personal users. The best you can do is delete your interactions with the Copilot chatbot by going to your Microsoft account's settings and privacy page. Look for a drop down menu labeled Copilot interaction history or Copilot activity history to find the delete button.\n\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT\n\nIf you've got an OpenAI account, go to the settings menu on your web browser and then to the Data controls section, where you can disable a setting to \"Improve the model for everyone.\" If you don't have an account, click on the small question mark at the bottom right of the web page, then click on settings, and you'll get the same option to opt out of AI training. Mobile users can make the same choice on the ChatGPT Android and iOS apps.\n\nOpenAI says on its data controls help page that when users opt out, their conversations will still appear in the chat history but won't be used for training. These temporary chats will be kept for 30 days and reviewed only if needed to monitor for abuse.\n\nGrok\n\nElon Musk's X quietly activated a setting that allows the billionaire Tesla CEO's AI chatbot Grok to be trained on data from the social media platform. This setting has been turned on by default and allows Grok to use data including your posts, “interactions, inputs, and results” for training and “fine-tuning.”\n\nThe change wasn't publicized and only came to light after X users spotted it in July. To opt out, you need to go to settings on X's desktop browser version, then click “Privacy and safety,” scroll down to “Grok” and then untick the box. You can also delete your conversation history with Grok if you have any. There’s no way to do it from the X mobile app, unfortunately.\n\nClaude\n\nAnthropic AI says its chatbot Claude is not trained on personal data. It also does not by default use questions or requests to train its AI models. However, users can give “explicit permission” for a specific response to be used in training by giving it a thumbs up or thumbs down or by emailing the company. Conversations that are flagged for a safety review could also be used to train the company's systems to better enforce its rules.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller’s investment firms trimmed their holdings in “Magnificent Seven” stocks before this year’s ebullient run-up in technology companies gave way to a major downturn in mid-July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nSoros Fund Management sold some of its stake in Alphabet Inc. totaling $58 million, and about $15 million of Amazon.com Inc., according to regulatory filings for the three months ended in June.\n\nDruckenmiller was among investors paring stakes in Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose soaring price accompanied investor fervor for artificial intelligence companies. His Duquesne Family Office sold more than 1.5 million shares, filings show.\n\nDavid Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, meanwhile, cut its holdings of Amazon, Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — three of its largest positions — continuing similar cuts reported at the end of March. David Bonderman’s Wildcat Capital Management also sold out of his Meta position, dumping shares worth $24 million in the quarter.\n\nThe filings point to how investors captured some of the benefits of the run-up before a benign economic outlook took a gloomier turn, with the Nasdaq 100 slumping 14% in the four-week period beginning July 10. The “Magnificent Seven” — which includes Alphabet, Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia — had been emblematic of the rally, reflected in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index, which rose 17% in both the first and second quarters.\n\nSpeaking in a CNBC interview in May, Druckenmiller — who earlier spent more than a decade as Soros’ chief strategist — suggested the artificial intelligence boom may be “over-hyped” in the short term.\n\nFunds with more than $100 million or more must file disclosures about their US holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The disclosures portray holdings of secretive money managers, including at hedge funds and large family offices that clear the threshold. Still, the picture is incomplete as documents omit most derivatives and short positions.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nIconiq Capital, the investment firm best known for managing money for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sold $2.5 million in Apple. Kemnay Advisory Services, a family office that helps manage the fortune of duty-free-shopping billionaire Alan Parker, cut its holdings of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. Soros sold out of its $108 million position in American National Insurance, and $67 million in Aramark. Druckenmiller’s Duquesne reported a new position in Mid-America Apartment Communities, a real estate investment trust that acquires multi-family apartments, worth $92 million and in cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. of $90 million. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. added stakes in cosmetics chain Ulta Beauty Inc. and aerospace company Heico Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with Buffett’s purchases in last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

META, Sanofi SNY and CME Group Inc. CME, as well a micro-cap stock The Cato Corp. CATO.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Meta, Sanofi and CME\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Sanofi and CME Group Inc., as well a micro-cap stock The Cato Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+49.6% vs. +12.3%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Sanofi have gained +11.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +24.8%. The company is witnessing generic erosion of Aubagio in all key markets and lower sales from mature products are hurting sales. Other headwinds include the weak performance of diabetes drugs and regular negative pipeline developments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi as it enjoys strong demand across all approved indications and geographies. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become a key top-line driver.\r\n\r\nSanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years. Sanofi has also accelerated its mid- and late-stage pipeline this year. It has also been active on the M&A front.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here >>>)\r\n\r\nCME Group shares have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry's gain of +18.6%. The company's escalating expenses due to higher technology costs are likely to put pressure on its margins. Also, its diversified product portfolio is significantly exposed to volatile interest rates, stricter government regulations and limited credit availability in unstable capital and credit markets.\r\n\r\nHowever, CME Group's strong market position, driven by varied derivative product lines, bodes well. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a stable global presence are encouraging.\r\n\r\nWhile higher electronic trading volume adds scalability, product innovation and a growing proportion of volume from customers outside the United States have been driving results. Solid liquidity supports wealth distribution to shareholders.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CME here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Cato have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry over the year-to-date period (-29.0% vs. +6.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $98.05 million is facing concerns which include declining same-store sales, store closures, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and low e-commerce sales, which can dampen growth and profitability.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Cato's first-quarter 2024 highlights robust earnings, effective cost management, and a strong financial foundation. Net income surged 148% to $11 million, driven by operational efficiency and cost control, showcasing resilience. Cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses decreased, boosting margins.\r\n\r\nWith $477.2 million in total assets and $39.1 million in cash, Cato's financial stability supports growth. Consistent dividends ($0.17 per share) and share repurchases (431,415 shares) underscore shareholder value commitment. Strategic e-commerce expansion and women's apparel focus align with market trends, positioning Cato for sustained revenue growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Cato here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Meta Platforms and AppLovin",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 15, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and AppLovin APP.\n\nMarket Rebound: 3 Stocks for the Next Leg Higher\n\nLast week the market experienced one of the fastest rises in volatility since the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis. The VIX index rose above 60 on Monday morning, which was a 40-point jump from the day before. However, what followed was equally impressive as volatility fell nearly just as fast as it rose, and today the VIX is below 17.\n\nWe know now that the unwind of the Yen carry trade led to a capitulation of the most levered traders and it seems that the worst is already behind us. And it makes sense that we can look forward confidently and use this as an opportunity to pick up shares in the best stocks.\n\nWe have a nice list of bullish factors holding up this market; the economy remains robust while inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve will begin lowering rates soon leading to an expansionary policy and earnings at the best companies in the world continue to grow nicely.\n\nSometimes you must see through the scary headlines and look at the most important variables that drive markets such as Fed liquidity and earnings growth. When investors do it like that, they can see these sharp corrections for what they really are, opportunities.\n\nSome of the best stocks in the world went on sale this last week and here I am going to identify three of my favorites. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and AppLovin have been some of the best performing stocks in the last year and based on their Zacks Ranks, growth forecasts and valuations remain unambiguously attractive.\n\nAppLovin Stock Boasts a Top Zacks Rank\n\nLesser known than the other two, AppLovin is a mobile technology company that specializes in mobile app growth, monetization, and user acquisition through its suite of software and services. AppLovin provides a powerful platform that enables app developers to enhance their marketing strategies, optimize user engagement, and maximize revenue. The company operates one of the largest mobile ad networks in the world and has also expanded into app development, acquiring and partnering with various gaming studios.\n\nAppLovin really has it all, as the stock enjoys powerful momentum pushing it higher, strong growth forecasts and a very reasonable valuation. Additionally, AppLovin has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, boosting the odds of a near-term rally. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates by a significant margin in just the last week. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to grow 20% annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the incredible appreciation the stock has experienced over the last two years it still trades near its lowest relative valuation. Because sales and earnings are growing so fast, the stock has actually gotten cheaper over the last year. Today, APP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.9x, which is right in line with the broad market and well below its three-year median of 64.5x.\n\nMeta Shares Approach All-Time Highs\n\nMeta Platforms is another stock that has put up truly stellar earnings results and price appreciation since the 2022 lows. In the chart below we can see that the price of META is bumping up against its recent all-time highs, and if it clears that level could begin another major bull leg.\n\nAlso visible in the chart is just how well Meta Platforms stock held up during the recent market correction and how quickly it has snapped higher.\n\nAlso worth noting is that Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and improving the near-term outlook of the stock. In the last month FY24 earning estimates have increased by 3.7% and FY25 by 2.6%. Current year sales are expected to grow 19.6% and next year's sales are expected to climb 14%. Furthermore, analysts project EPS to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.9x, which is just above the market average and just below its 10-year median of 25.1x. META also now pays a tidy 0.38% dividend to shareholders.\n\nNvidia Continues to Show Impressive Growth\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, Nvidia is not at the top of the Zacks rank, however it still boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Nvidia has of course been hugely influential to the broader market and the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. The company's vision into what AI could be, and its ability to position itself as the key piece of infrastructure for the technology had set it on a path to more than triple its sales and nearly 7x its EPS in the last two years.\n\nOver the last month the stock experienced its sharpest correction since the big bull run began, but like the others, investors have been snapping up shares during the sell off. Also like the others, Nvidia still enjoys a reasonable valuation, attracting new investors.\n\nWe can also see that the price action in NVDA is looking quite bullish as well, as on Monday, the stock broke out from a descending channel.\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 45.8x. This is above the broad market average and just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Although that may appear elevated to some investors,analysts forecast NVDA EPS to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, simply indicating a valuation priced for tremendous growth in profits.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs markets show signs of rebounding, the potential for the next leg higher is enticing. Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and AppLovin have all demonstrated strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and reasonable valuations that make them attractive picks. However, it's essential to remember that the market is unpredictable and can turn volatile without warning.\n\nWhile the current outlook might be optimistic, investors should always prioritize risk management. Maintaining a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and not overcommitting to any single position can help mitigate potential downsides. The market will ultimately do what it wants, and staying vigilant while focusing on long-term goals is key to navigating these opportunities wisely.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\n\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\n\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\n\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\n\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\n\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\n\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nYTD Return as of August 1: 44%\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm has been aggressively marketing several AI products, including Meta AI, a virtual assistant powered with AI, as well as smart devices, like Meta Smart Glasses and Meta Quest, that use AI to provide computational power to individual users at their fingertips. The firm is also investing heavily in developing AI data centers that will serve individual customers and businesses with their AI needs on Meta devices across the world.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), addressed the advertising market during the second quarter earnings call, as his company derives a significant portion of revenue from advertisements that run on the platforms it owns. He noted that AI was going to drive a change in advertising markets in the coming years, as even the creatives needed for marketing shifted towards AI assistants.\n\nOverall META ranks 22nd on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "7 Virtual Reality Stocks That May Shape Future Entertainment",
        "content": "Virtual reality (VR) stocks ride on the coattails of trends seen in the market, such as the metaverse, cloud gaming and immersive entertainment experiences. Virtual reality draws them together, and I think we have only just started to witness its full potential.\n\nThe VR market, already valued at $22.81 billion in 2024, is projected to grow exponentially, driven by innovations in hardware and software. Companies at the forefront of this trend are not only changing how we entertain ourselves but also how we communicate with others in general. My view is that over time, society will live in deeper and deeper virtual worlds. This, however, will be a gradual change rather than a seismic shift. Instead of us all being plugged into VR headsets, we will interact with more virtual worlds embedded into apps and websites we already use, particularly in the realm of social media.\n\nSo, in order to take advantage of this trend in the entertainment industry, here are seven virtual reality stocks for investors to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a stock that has been criticized in the past for overselling the metaverse ideas to the masses. However, my view is that it is positioning itself at the forefront of the gradual shift toward virtual environments, and its results in the short term certainly speak volumes.\n\nWith revenue of $39.07 billion, a 22% increase year-over-year (YOY), and net income surging by 73% last quarter, it can be hard to argue that the company is on the wrong track — at least in the short term. Meanwhile, for investors interested in META as one of those virtual reality stocks in the gaming industry, I think the best has yet to come. The company’s flagship product in this space, the Meta Quest series of VR headsets, has established Meta as a leading player in the VR gaming industry, with reviewers mentioning it among the best of the best in terms of affordability and features offered.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of those virtual reality stocks to consider if an investor wants exposure to a picks and shovels stock in the industry. The company provides essential semiconductors to a range of industries, including VR. They can also be found in devices that range from self-driving cars to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. I like QCOM stock because it is not overly concentrated in any given industry, thus giving it impressive diversification benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nQCOM makes its presence felt in the gaming industry through its Snapdragon platform, which powers many of the world’s leading gaming smartphones. In its fiscal third quarter of 2024, Qualcomm reported strong revenue growth, with its QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) division generating $8.07 billion, a 12% increase YOY.\n\nOne of the main tailwinds I see from QCOM in the gaming industry is the rollout of 5G and increasing mobile network speeds. I don’t think we are too far away from the point where multiplayer mobile games can be played on these networks with a low ping or latency, which substantially reduces user friction to enjoying entertainment on the move.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is another one of those virtual reality stocks that also fits firmly in the picks and shovels category. It provides its Unity game engine, which is seeing increased use in VR gaming to create virtual worlds, most notably by independent developers.\n\nUnity’s platform is responsible for 70% of the top mobile games and averages 3.7 billion downloads per month, according to the results it posted last quarter. Unity 6, set to launch in the fall of 2024, promises to be the software’s most stable and high-performing version yet. I see it as having an expanding use case in VR devices, including the Oculus, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR.\n\nIt is still very early for Unity’s software to be utilized in virtual environments, as its engine is primarily used in mobile gaming. Still, as demand picks up, I think its engine will become the preferred choice of developers who choose to create games in VR since they are likely already familiar with building games with it.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is perhaps one of the best virtual reality stocks for investors who want a pure-play gaming franchise in their portfolios. Although RBLX is known for its presence in the PC and console markets, Roblox empowers its global community of creators to design and build VR experiences that can be accessed by users on newer devices, including VR headsets.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why I think RBLX stock could be an ideal opportunity for investors. Roblox enables creators to experiment with new forms of digital interaction, from social experiences to complex games, which enables a smooth transition for more of these creations to be conducted in virtual worlds.\n\nFurthermore, its core business also showed considerable strength last quarter. Revenue increased by 31% YOY to $893.5 million, and bookings grew by 22% to $955.2 million. The company saw record daily active users (DAUs) of 79.5 million, up 21%. This makes it one of those virtual reality stocks for investors to consider.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of those gatekeepers of VR content on the internet, and I expect it to continue to play a leading role in the future through its Google services, particularly YouTube and Google Play, which support VR content and experiences. It acts as a main distributor of content for people to access.\n\nThe company achieved $84.7 billion in revenue last quarter, with significant contributions from Google Services and Google Cloud, the latter exceeding $10 billion in quarterly revenues for the first time.\n\nGOOG stock has a stranglehold over the app market as well as the online streaming market with its YouTube platform. As gaming and VR experiences continue to be rolled out on the platform, I expect this to be a major boon for the company moving forward.\n\nI like GOOG stock due to its solid position in the online advertising market, and it also stands to benefit from the rise of VR as an additional tailwind.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Illustrative Editorial of Matterport's (MTTR stock) website homepage. MATTERPORT logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nI like Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) in the VR gaming industry, especially when one frames its long-term positioning with its short-term results last quarter, with total revenue reaching $42.2 million, driven by a 16% YOY increase in subscription revenue to $24.2 million. The company also saw a 28% increase in total subscribers to 1.06 million.\n\nMTTR stock has an enormous application in VR gaming and is one of the key reasons I’m bullish on its future prospects. By transforming physical spaces into immersive, interactive 3D models, Matterport enables developers and gamers to create and explore realistic virtual environments. This is achieved through its digital twin technology and spatial data platform.\n\nIt could then be a great piece in the puzzle for hyper-realistic gaming, such as transforming city streets into driving simulations or real-world forests into the backdrop of a horror or survival game. I expect great things in the future for MTTR stock as it taps into the gaming market in VR.\n\nTake-Two Interactive (TTWO) Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO) is an American video game holding company. A smartphone with the Take-Two logo on the screen surrounded by gamepads.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO) is another publisher in a similar vein to RBLX that stands to benefit directly from VR gaming with its established and captive user base. Its titles like “Grand Theft Auto” and “NBA 2K” could be prime targets for the company to experiment with developing virtual worlds. It has exclusive rights to some of the world’s most popular video game franchises, especially in sports, so I think it could be a prime investment target for those looking to capitalize on the VR gaming trend.\n\nLast quarter, it recorded $1.22 billion in net bookings, meeting guidance. GAAP net revenue grew 4% YOY to $1.34 billion. However, it also reported a GAAP net loss of $262 million.\n\nStill, for investors serious about the opportunities in VR gaming, which is a recognition that we have yet to see the start of its potential, stocks like RBLX and TTWO could be worthy to consider as both firms seek to expand their catalogs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: This Tech Giant Will Emerge as the Leading Artificial Intelligence Company in the World",
        "content": "Companies have spent tens of billions of dollars in a race to advance artificial intelligence capabilities over the past two years. Several companies have emerged as big winners in the early days of the generative AI boom, but not all of them will maintain their leading position.\n\nBut I predict one tech giant will come out ahead in artificial intelligence in the long run. It has the resources to make the required investments in AI capabilities and a business model that will allow it to make the most out of its efforts. Moreover, the CEO made becoming the leading AI company in the world a priority for the business.\n\nHere's why Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) will become the AI leader in the long run. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta stands out from the crowd\n\nThere are three ways Meta's differentiating itself from other tech companies working to capitalize on the AI opportunities. Combining these factors has enabled Meta to improve its AI capabilities quickly and they all benefit one another over time, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\n1. Open-sourcing its foundation model\n\nMeta's Llama foundation models are open source. Since Meta isn't trying to make money directly from licensing its model like OpenAI or other developers, it can afford to offer it for free to independent developers.\n\nIf Meta can increase the adoption of Llama among developers through its open-source license, it feeds the entire ecosystem of building and using the model. Everything from increasing the efficiency of the model at both the software layer and the hardware layer to expanding the toolsets that work with the model becomes easier with a broader user base. That can save Meta both time and money in the long run.\n\n2. Using AI across all of its products\n\nMeta uses AI across almost everything it builds. Its social media apps, its advertising business, and its metaverse products all tap into the AI models Meta builds to improve user experiences and operational results.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said content recommendation continues to improve as it expands its recommendation AI models to more general areas. There's still a lot of room to expand, which means it could continue to see improvements in overall engagement. Engagement increased last quarter, as it saw a 10% year-over-year improvement in ad impressions.\n\nMeta's also able to integrate AI with its advertising platform. It can use its models to target advertisements and generative AI features already help create and test new versions of ads. Zuckerberg sees AI reaching the point where a business can simply set a business objective and budget and it takes care of the rest.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's also building new AI products, including its Meta AI chatbot, which it integrates into Instagram and Facebook. Meta's goal is to make it the most-used AI assistant by the end of the year. It also released a tool to help businesses build their own chatbots, AI Studio, which could ultimately lead to business messaging monetization opportunities.\n\n3. Spending massive sums of cash\n\nSupporting Meta's AI development is the amount it's investing in building out data centers to train and run its AI models. Meta plans to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion this year on capital expenditures, and it expects that number to climb significantly higher next year to support AI research and development.\n\nOnly a handful of companies are spending more on capital expenditures -- namely, the hyperscale public cloud providers. Importantly, Meta is only providing data-center capacity for itself.\n\nBut that spending is fully supported by the strength of its business. \"We are in the fortunate position where the strong results we're seeing in our core products and business gives us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future,\" Zuckerberg said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\n\nIndeed, the company's free cash flow totaled $10.9 billion last quarter, and Meta ended June with $58 billion in cash on hand with just $18 billion in debt.\n\nThe stock looks like a great opportunity right now\n\nDespite the strong results and the potential for it to lead the next leg of AI development, Meta's stock remains reasonably priced relative to many hot AI stocks.\n\nShares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25, which puts it near the bottom end of the group of trillion-dollar tech stocks. Its efforts should support double-digit revenue growth for years to come while maintaining high margins thanks to the operating leverage inherent in its business. The biggest factor weighing down its profit will be increased depreciation expenses from the step up in capital expenditures. As such, cash flow should remain strong.\n\nInvestors looking for one of the best ways to invest in AI should take a close look at Meta stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Labor market, AI key themes in US earnings calls: Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "In a Wednesday note to clients, Goldman Sachs strategists highlighted key issues that company managements have faced in the second quarter. After reviewing earnings call transcripts, the bank identified three dominant themes: the labor market, consumer behavior, and AI.\n\nInvestor attention has shifted back to the labor market after July's payrolls report came in below expectations. Despite this, Goldman’s economists note that job openings still point to strong labor demand. The recent uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3% was largely due to temporary layoffs and labor supply issues, particularly for new immigrants.\n\n\"Company commentary this quarter regarding hiring plans and the labor market largely reflects a healthy labor market,” strategists said in the note.\n\nAlthough some companies have discussed reducing headcount or slowing hiring, the overall tone suggests a better alignment between hiring needs and the available workforce, marking a major shift from the post-pandemic period when labor shortages were a major issue. The share of companies mentioning labor shortages has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, and references to layoffs in earnings calls remained low in 2Q.\n\nRegarding the state of the consumer, companies’ commentary on 2Q earnings calls has reflected mixed sentiment, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile some companies reported weaker sales due to ongoing macroeconomic pressures on consumers, others observed resilient spending. Discussions frequently centered on the affordability of products and disparities between low- and high-income consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, quantitative results from consumer earnings reports align with broader macroeconomic data, indicating a generally healthy U.S. consumer.\n\nS&P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors showed a 60/40 split between earnings beats and misses, challenging the idea that all consumer-facing stocks are struggling.\n\nThe US Consumer Dashboard also points to a reasonably healthy consumer, though economic data highlight growing disparities between income cohorts, with lower-income consumers facing slower income growth and divergent consumer sentiment compared to higher-income groups.\n\nOn the AI front, 2Q earnings calls continued to reflect strong hype around the technology, with a particular focus on the significant investments required to harness it.\n\nHyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) were closely watched as investors assessed both the demand for AI-enabled products and services and the companies' AI investment plans, strategists note.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing their earnings reports, consensus estimates for 2025 hyperscaler capital expenditures and R&D increased by 3%. This ongoing investment trend was echoed by companies involved in building AI infrastructure, including data center REITs, utilities, and semiconductor manufacturers.\n\n“These AI infrastructure companies highlighted that continued investment in AI would translate into a continued tailwind for their businesses,” strategists said.\n\nBeyond the hyperscalers, other firms emphasized the efficiency and productivity gains achieved through AI.\n\nYear to date, AI infrastructure stocks have outperformed the equal-weight S&P 500 by 20 percentage points, compared to 3 percentage points of underperformance for stocks tied to AI-enabled revenues and long-term productivity gains.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLabor market, AI key themes in US earnings calls: Goldman Sachs\n\nCisco shares jump on earnings beat and job cuts\n\nAdmiral shares soar on strong H1 results\n\nView comments",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has shut down CrowdTangle, a tool widely used by researchers, watchdog organizations and journalists to monitor social media posts, notably to track how misinformation spreads on the company's platforms.\n\nWednesday's shutdown, which Meta announced earlier this year, has been protested by researchers and nonprofits. In May, dozens of groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, Human Rights Watch and NYU’s Center for Social Media & Politics, sent a letter to the company asking that it keep the tool running through at least January so it would be available through the U.S. presidential elections.\n\n“This decision jeopardizes essential pre- and post-election oversight mechanisms and undermines Meta’s transparency efforts during this critical period, and at a time when social trust and digital democracy are alarmingly fragile,” the letter said.\n\nCrowdTangle, “has been an essential tool in helping researchers parse through the vast amount of information on the platform and identify harmful content and threats,” it added.\n\nIn March, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation sent Meta a similar letter asking it to keep the tool, which was available for free, functioning until January. That letter was also signed by several dozen groups and individual academic researchers.\n\n“For years, CrowdTangle has represented an industry best practice for real-time platform transparency. It has become a lifeline for understanding how disinformation, hate speech, and voter suppression spread on Facebook, undermining civic discourse and democracy,\" the Mozilla letter said.\n\nMeta has released an alternative to CrowdTangle, called the Meta Content Library. But access to it is limited to academic researchers and nonprofits, which excludes most news organizations. Critics have also complained that it's not as useful as CrowdTangle — at least not yet.\n\nNick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said in a blog post last week that the company has been gathering feedback about Meta Content Library from “hundreds of researchers in order to make it more user-friendly and help them find the data they need for their work.”\n\nMeta acquired CrowdTangle in 2016.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock saw a 14% increase last week, outpacing the 4% return for the S&P 500. This strong performance was driven by a positive market response to Meta’s earnings report, highlighting second-quarter results in its core advertising business.\n\nThe stock’s recent rally marks a significant turnaround from the previous quarter, when concerns over Meta’s AI investments led to a sharp decline in its share price. The high stock price growth reflects growing street optimism about Meta’s capacity to execute its AI initiatives while continuing to deliver strong results in its core business areas.\n\nMoreover, this recovery suggests that the market is beginning to accept the financial value of Meta’s investments in AI. These are starting to yield tangible benefits. Further, the market’s positive response to Meta’s Q2 earnings indicates that Meta may outperform its Magnificent 7 peers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and may continue its upward trajectory. This outperformance will likely attract prolonged street interest that may support the stock’s momentum, making Meta stock a strong buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvertising and User Engagement Strength\n\nMeta’s core advertising business remains a core driver of its performance. The business contributed $38.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 22% annual increase. Given the challenging macro conditions, this growth is decisive, indicating that Meta’s advertising platforms deliver value to advertisers. The company progressively leveraged its vast user base. The user base now includes 3.27 billion daily active users across its apps, which derives engagement and ad top-line growth.\n\nFurther, the strong performance of Meta’s advertising business is highly supported by the 10% increase in ad impressions. There was also a 10% rise in the average price per ad. These metrics highlight the sharpness of Meta’s ad targeting and delivery mechanisms. MEta saw growth in ad revenue across different geographic regions (particularly Asia Pacific and Europe). This underscores Meta’s platforms’ global reach and appeal to advertisers in diverse markets.\n\nThe company is focused on improving the quality of ad recommendations and enhancing user engagement through AI-driven advancements. This has been critical to maintaining Meta stock’s progressive market valuation in digital advertising.\n\nMassive User Base and Engagement\n\nMeta’s user base continues to grow, with the number of people using its Family of Apps on a daily basis averaging 3.27 billion in June, an increase of 7% year-over-year. This represents a significant increase in user engagement, driven by the company’s efforts to enhance the user experience across its platforms. The growth is robust in regions like Asia Pacific and Europe. Here, ad revenue increased by 33% and 26%, highlighting Meta’s global appeal.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the company has had a lot of success in attracting and retaining users. This is especially true among young adults, as observed in the growing popularity of platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. For instance, WhatsApp now boasts over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., While Threads is approaching 200 million monthly active users globally. These platforms are becoming increasingly important to Meta’s overall ecosystem. They contribute to higher user engagement and offer new monetization opportunities. Its focus on enhancing the user experience through AI-driven content recommendations has been instrumental in deriving Meta stock’s high price growth.\n\nAI Investments and Growth Potential\n\nThe company plans to spend $37 billion to $40 billion this year in capital expenditures, and its aggressive investments in AI are beginning to bear fruit. These significant advancements boosted AI-driven content recommendations and ad targeting. For instance, the company has rolled out a full-screen video player. Similarly, a unified video recommendation service across Facebook integrates Reels, longer videos, and live content into a single experience. This initiative already increased engagement on Facebook Reels. This indicates the potential for further growth as Meta continues to refine its AI models.\n\nFinally, Meta’s AI advancements extend beyond its core business. It also extends to new experiences and products like Meta AI and AI Studio. These platforms allow users and businesses to create personalized AI agents, offering new ways to engage with content and communities. The potential for widespread adoption of these AI-driven tools could significantly boost Meta’s revenue streams. This is particularly true in the business messaging and creator economy segments. Lastly, the company’s lead on open-source AI is reflected in the release of Llama 3.1, which positions Meta as a leader in the AI industry and justifies a buy rating for the stock.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in AAPL.\n\nYiannis Zourmpanos is the founder of Yiazou Capital Research, a stock-market research platform designed to elevate the due diligence process through in-depth business analysis.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. on Wednesday shuttered CrowdTangle, a popular social media analysis tool that journalists, civic groups and researchers used to monitor trending posts on platforms like Facebook and Instagram in real time.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nThe timing of the tool’s shutdown, months ahead of a major US presidential election, has drawn concern from groups that relied on CrowdTangle to track the flow of information on social media, including viral falsehoods that have led to real-world harm. Using CrowdTangle, journalists and researchers could show how many users engaged with a piece of content, which groups supercharged the spread of a post and just how often political and medical misinformation went viral on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIn July, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg a letter asking to delay the discontinuation of CrowdTangle for six months, stating that the company “has a responsibility to ensure that the public, independent researchers, journalists, and policymakers can study and address the impact that platforms and their algorithms are having.” In a response to that letter earlier this week, Meta said it was continuing with CrowdTangle’s shutdown because the tool has been “hard to maintain” and “does not provide a representative picture of what is happening on our platforms.”\n\nThe company said it still plans to replace CrowdTangle with the Meta Content Library, a new tool that Meta has argued would include more expansive data, like the ability to analyze comments. Researchers associated with nonprofit institutions must apply to through a third party and Meta partner, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan, for access to the library. But news publishers and other groups with commercial interests won’t be eligible to use the tool, which has been criticized for being an inadequate replacement for CrowdTangle. An analysis from Proof News cited 11 features, including the ability to see social media metrics over time and dashboard sharing, that Meta Content Library lacked compared to CrowdTangle when used for research.\n\nAsked for comment on CrowdTangle’s shutdown, a Meta spokesperson pointed to a November blog post the company wrote to announce the new Meta Content Library tool.\n\nIn separate statements, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, called Meta’s response “disappointing,” and Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said it “only highlights the need for more oversight and scrutiny of Big Tech.”\n\nCrowdTangle was founded in 2011 and quickly gained popularity among media clients like BuzzFeed, CNN, Vox and NBC for its ability to track trending posts on social media platforms. Five years later, Meta acquired the tool, making it free and expanding its access for others across media. Soon, reporters and researchers were using the tool to investigate topics as diverse as Russian influence operations, misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic and the QAnon conspiracy movement.\n\nJournalists’ use of the tool also shed light on Facebook and Instagram users’ high engagement levels with inflammatory conspiracies. In 2021, Meta executives clashed over the issue of data transparency and how much the social network should reveal about popular content on its platform. That July, the New York Times reported that the CrowdTangle team within Meta was being broken up. Meta also rescinded other initiatives, including a $40,000 grant that aimed to help research partners use CrowdTangle data to understand public discussion around the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nUntil CrowdTangle’s closure, Meta maintained a list of dozens of case studies showing how researchers used the tool to, for instance, identify Russia-linked influence operations in Africa or track Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.\n\nIn 2022, Bloomberg reported that Meta had started an official internal process to shutter CrowdTangle. Though the company’s executives have recently framed the shutdown of the tool as necessary because it is “degrading,” the company had already been devoting dwindling resources to the product, Bloomberg reported. In mid-2022, fewer than five engineers on Facebook’s London integrity team were tasked with keeping CrowdTangle afloat.\n\nIn their letter to Meta, lawmakers noted that the Meta Content Library provides a view of the platform only at the time a search is conducted, which would make it difficult for researchers to reproduce a search or a study conducted by another. The lawmakers also noted that the constraint “limits and complicates the ability of researchers to study what occurred on the platform.” That could make it harder for researchers to investigate, for instance, the origin and spread of election-related misinformation on Facebook and Instagram over time.\n\nFabio Giglietto, an associate professor of Internet Studies at University of Urbino Carlo Bo in Italy said that he anticipated many researchers would voice their disappointment over the end of CrowdTangle. “The alternative is not yet fully ready,” Giglietto said, citing difficulties with running queries on the tool using the virtual environment it requires. “This is particularly frustrating for those who successfully navigated the overly complex application process and cumbersome setup,” he said.\n\nMeta’s move to sunset CrowdTangle also comes amid relaxed content moderation policies and information integrity efforts across social media platforms.\n\nThe Global Alliance for Responsible Media — a nonprofit coalition of major advertisers formed in 2019 to pressure tech platforms to adopt stricter content moderation policies — last week ceased operations after Elon Musk accused the group of orchestrating a boycott against the platform. The Stanford Internet Observatory, which has focused on election integrity, also was dismantled after a sustained campaign from Republicans to discredit research institutions and their investigations of political influence campaigns on social media platforms.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Market Rebound: 3 Stocks to Buy for the Next Leg Higher",
        "content": "Last week the market experienced one of the fastest rises in volatility since the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis. The VIX index rose above 60 on Monday morning, which was a 40-point jump from the day before. However, what followed was equally impressive as volatility fell nearly just as fast as it rose, and today the VIX is below 17.\n\nWe know now that the unwind of the Yen carry trade led to a capitulation of the most levered traders and it seems that the worst is already behind us. And it makes sense that we can look forward confidently and use this as an opportunity to pick up shares in the best stocks.\n\nWe have a nice list bullish factors holding up this market; the economy remains robust while inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve will begin lowering rates soon leading to an expansionary policy and earnings at the best companies in the world continue to grow nicely.\n\nSometimes you must see through the scary headlines and look at the most important variables that drive markets such as Fed liquidity and earnings growth. When investors do it like that, they can see these sharp corrections for what they really are, opportunities.\n\nSome of the best stocks in the world went on sale this last week and here I am going to identify three of my favorites. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and AppLovin (APP) have been some of the best performing stocks in the last year and based on their Zacks Ranks, growth forecasts and valuations remain unambiguously attractive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAppLovin Stock Boasts a Top Zacks Rank\n\nLesser known that the other two, AppLovin is a mobile technology company that specializes in mobile app growth, monetization, and user acquisition through its suite of software and services. AppLovin provides a powerful platform that enables app developers to enhance their marketing strategies, optimize user engagement, and maximize revenue. The company operates one of the largest mobile ad networks in the world and has also expanded into app development, acquiring and partnering with various gaming studios.\n\nAppLovin really has it all, as the stock enjoys powerful momentum pushing it higher, strong growth forecasts and a very reasonable valuation. Additionally, AppLovin has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, boosting the odds of a near-term rally. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates by a significant margin in just the last week. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to growth 20% annually. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the incredible appreciation the stock has experienced over the last two years it still trades near its lowest relative valuation. Because sales and earnings are growing so fast, the stock has actually gotten cheaper over the last year. Today, APP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.9x, which is right in line with the broad market and well below its three-year median of 64.5x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Shares Approach All-Time Highs\n\nMeta Platforms is another stock that has put up truly stellar earnings results and price appreciation since the 2022 lows. In the chart below we can see that the price of META is bumping up against its recent all-time highs, and if it clears that level could begin another major bull leg.\n\nAlso visible in the chart is just how well Meta Platforms stock held up during the recent market correction and how quickly it has snapped higher. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAlso worth noting is that Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and improving the near-term outlook of the stock. In the last month FY24 earning estimates have increased by 3.7% and FY25 by 2.6%. Current year sales are expected to grow 19.6% and next year’s sales are expected to climb 14%. Furthermore, analysts project EPS to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.9x, which is just above the market average and just below its 10-year median of 25.1x. META also now pays a tidy 0.38% dividend to shareholders. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia Continues to Show Impressive Growth\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, Nvidia is not at the top of the Zacks rank, however it still boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Nvidia has of course been hugely influential to the broader market and the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. The company’s vision into what AI could be, and its ability to position itself as the key piece of infrastructure for the technology had set it on a path to more than triple its sales and nearly 7x its EPS in the last two years.\n\nOver the last month the stock experienced its sharpest correction since the big bull run began, but like the others, investors have been snapping up shares during the sell off. Also like the others, Nvidia still enjoys a reasonable valuation, attracting new investors.\n\nWe can also see that the price action in NVDA is looking quite bullish as well, as on Monday, the stock broke out from a descending channel. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 45.8x. This is above the broad market average and just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Although that may appear elevated to some investors,analysts forecast NVDA EPS to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, simply indicating a valuation priced for tremendous growth in profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs markets show signs of rebounding, the potential for the next leg higher is enticing. Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and AppLovin have all demonstrated strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and reasonable valuations that make them attractive picks. However, it's essential to remember that the market is unpredictable and can turn volatile without warning.\n\nWhile the current outlook might be optimistic, investors should always prioritize risk management. Maintaining a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and not overcommitting to any single position can help mitigate potential downsides. The market will ultimately do what it wants, and staying vigilant while focusing on long-term goals is key to navigating these opportunities wisely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wednesday, August 14, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Sanofi (SNY) and CME Group Inc. (CME), as well a micro-cap stock The Cato Corporation (CATO). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+49.6% vs. +12.3%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. \r\n\r\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. \r\n\r\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Sanofi have gained +11.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +24.8%. The company is witnessing generic erosion of Aubagio in all key markets and lower sales from mature products are hurting sales. Other headwinds include the weak performance of diabetes drugs and regular negative pipeline developments.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi as it enjoys strong demand across all approved indications and geographies. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become a key top-line driver. \r\n\r\nSanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years. Sanofi has also accelerated its mid- and late-stage pipeline this year. It has also been active on the M&A front.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Sanofi here >>>)\r\n\r\nCME Group shares have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry’s gain of +18.6%. The company’s escalating expenses due to higher technology costs are likely to put pressure on its margins. Also, its diversified product portfolio is significantly exposed to volatile interest rates, stricter government regulations and limited credit availability in unstable capital and credit markets.\r\n\r\nHowever, CME Group’s strong market position, driven by varied derivative product lines, bodes well. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a stable global presence are encouraging. \r\n\r\nWhile higher electronic trading volume adds scalability, product innovation and a growing proportion of volume from customers outside the United States have been driving results. Solid liquidity supports wealth distribution to shareholders.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CME here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Cato have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry over the year-to-date period (-29.0% vs. +6.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $98.05 million is facing concerns which include declining same-store sales, store closures, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and low e-commerce sales, which can dampen growth and profitability.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Cato's first-quarter 2024 highlights robust earnings, effective cost management, and a strong financial foundation. Net income surged 148% to $11 million, driven by operational efficiency and cost control, showcasing resilience. Cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses decreased, boosting margins. \r\n\r\nWith $477.2 million in total assets and $39.1 million in cash, Cato's financial stability supports growth. Consistent dividends ($0.17 per share) and share repurchases (431,415 shares) underscore shareholder value commitment. Strategic e-commerce expansion and women's apparel focus align with market trends, positioning Cato for sustained revenue growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Cato here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL), Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM) and DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks Poised for a Comeback After Last Week’s Market Meltdown AI stocks",
        "content": "Last Monday’s market rout saw tech stocks, specifically AI stocks experience major selloffs as investors across the board decided to take profits from overvalued positions.\n\nIn fact, for many of the companies that experienced the correction, the selloff was a long time coming. As such, oversold AI stocks could be poised for a strong comeback as investors flock back to bullish sentiments on AI.\n\nMoreover, these three AI stocks could see their prospects improve as a result of broader tech success beyond the news-cathing AI products. As a result, these companies might offer investors more long-term stability than companies that trade as pure plays in AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, as a word of caution, the market itself has not escaped the downward pressures of a potential U.S. recession. This means that at any time, these stocks could experience another downturn as the one seen last week.\n\nAs such, investors should look cautiously upon these three AI stocks with potential comebacks in the making.\n\nMonday.com (MNDY) Monday.com (MNDY) logo displayed on smartphone held by two hands\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/monticello\n\nAs a provider of project management software, Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) doesn’t seem like one of the most obvious plays among AI stocks, its prospects appear strong to most analysts. Much of the recent excitement comes from the company’s exceptional second-quarter earnings report.\n\nSpecifically, the company excelled in revenue growth and soaring net income.\n\nAs a result, the company posted a beat of EPS expectations by 67% with a more modest revenue beat around 3%. This has turned broader media attention positive on the stock, with investors buying into it after last week’s tech selloff left it slightly discounted.\n\nMoreover, the company’s notable metrics increases in net dollar retention rate which came in at 110% overall suggest it will not struggle to keep up this momentum heading into the next quarter. This could bode exceptionally well for investors who buy in during this comeback run.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen.

This, alongside major news about its augmented reality projects and AI platforms, could push the stock even higher by the end of the year. This makes the $600 mark possible in the face of continued growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company has successfully pulled off a pivot from the standard social media image to one of a tech investment firm working to push the edges of innovation. As such, investors should seriously consider Meta stock as a strong option for a growth-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, no company has as much flexibility, thanks to diverse revenue streams as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) does. That’s because recently, the company has shown dominant sales performance, despite the slowing consumer market. Moreover, many of its services are still in demand, thanks to a 14% increase year-over-year in service revenues.\n\nAs such, through its strong data collection efforts with Amazon web services, AMZN stock is likely to have no issues with recovering from last week’s text stock so off. Looking at the companies price to earnings ratio of 40x, it’s likely that Amazon will be able to sustain further growth once it goes back on the uptrend following last week’s market crash.\n\nAmazon’s expansion could, however, slow. This would be the case if the U.S. enters a full recession, or if the Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates over the next few months, both of which cases are likely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "'Sheriff of Silicon Valley': How Kamala Harris's tenure as California AG could shape her approach to Big Tech",
        "content": "During Kamala Harris’s stint as California’s top prosecutor, few knew her better than Travis LeBlanc — the special assistant attorney general of California and one of her most senior advisers.\n\nWhile working for Harris, LeBlanc’s responsibilities included tech regulation, cybersecurity, privacy, and antitrust. Yahoo Finance spoke to LeBlanc exclusively about Harris's moves during her tenure from 2011 to 2017, including her business track record and pro-growth approach to tech companies.\n\n“She is mindful that there are large players and small players in tech, and those aren't the same,” LeBlanc said. “One of the biggest concerns is that disruptors are given an opportunity to succeed, and that they aren't squelched by either an incumbent or a very large player in the market before they've had a chance to flourish.”\n\nInsight into a Harris administration\n\nLast week, the US Dept. of Justice ruled that Google (GOOGL, GOOG) violated an antitrust law with its search business. The ruling, a major victory for the Biden administration, could serve as a template for future cases. However, Harris has so far stayed silent on what an antitrust environment would look like if she were elected president.\n\nLeBlanc said one of Harris's biggest goals has always been “giving disruptors an opportunity to compete, recognizing that the incentives of incumbents and larger companies may be to use the power of the government to help exclude them from competing in the marketplace.”\n\nIn 2012, Harris sued and reached a $3.75 million settlement with eBay (EBAY) over allegations the company violated anti-competitive laws regarding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit.\n\nOne of the biggest antitrust cases Harris handled came in late 2011 when she successfully blocked AT&T’s buyout of T-Mobile’s US operations. At the time, Harris joined 10 other states that banded together following several meetings with AT&T's leadership.\n\n“That was a very big deal,” LeBlanc said. “T-Mobile used that to become the T-Mobile that we know of today. They now compete directly with AT&T and Verizon.”\n\nWhile her prosecutorial record in California provides some hints on how she would run the country, LeBlanc and several former staffers Yahoo Finance spoke to describe Harris as an effective communicator who wouldn’t always use litigation as a tool.\n\nOne of Harris's key accomplishments as attorney general was in 2012 when her office reached an agreement with six tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google, Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ), and Research In Motion, requiring the companies to include clear privacy policies for users before they downloaded apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I can't imagine that today those companies would all sign an agreement with any attorney general or department of justice,” LeBlanc said. “It was a real testament to her ability to convene, to work with the stakeholders, and to try and achieve a resolution that would benefit everyone.”\n\nAs vice president, Harris has played a key role in the Biden administration’s efforts around artificial intelligence.\n\n“President Biden and I reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation,” Harris said at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London last year. “We can and we must do both.”\n\nLeBlanc said a Harris administration would likely continue parts of Biden’s AI policies, adding she will “be mindful that the technology is evolving, and if we're going to regulate it, we need to do so in a way that’s nimble, so that we don't end up impeding the progress of technology in the future in ways that no one intended today.” Vice President Kamala Harris swearing in Travis LeBlanc to his second term on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in October 2022. (Twitter.com/VP)\n\nBig Tech vs the FTC\n\nWhen Harris was running to become California’s attorney general in 2010, wealthy supporters included Salesforce (CRM)’s Marc Benioff, Apple’s Jony Ive, Meta (META)’s Sheryl Sandberg, and the wife of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs (who is also the founder and president of Emerson Collective).\n\nOn Sunday, Harris returned to the city where her political career began for a fundraiser. It was her first trip back to San Francisco since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket. “This is a room full of dear, dear, dear friends,” Harris said to the gathering of Silicon Valley elites. She raised $13 million that day.\n\nThe pro-Harris movement in tech includes donations and endorsements from Netflix (NFLX)’s Reed Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Box (BOX)’s Aaron Levie, Khosla Venture's Vinod Khosla, and Melinda French Gates, among others.\n\nBut Harris faces a delicate balance between appeasing her donors and regulating the tech industry. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who donated $7 million to her campaign, told CNN last month that if Harris is elected she should replace Lina Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nKhan’s term expires in September and her future as FTC chair remains unknown. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft — a company with a history of clashing with the FTC. According to Hoffman, Harris should elect a new antitrust chief, as Khan is “waging a war on American business.”\n\nWhen asked if Hoffman or the opinion of her deep-pocketed tech donors would impact Harris's decision on who should lead the FTC, LeBlanc said, “I think she will ultimately make any personnel decisions based on who she thinks is the right person for the job.”\n\nFormer staffers say Harris helped shape Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley shaped Harris, who once campaigned on being the “sheriff of Silicon Valley.” It remains to be seen if she will have the same moniker if she’s elected commander in chief.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nMeta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$642 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Meta Platforms' US$529 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$567\n\nHow far off is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nCrunching The Numbers\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$53.0b US$58.2b US$62.0b US$70.5b US$75.6b US$80.0b US$83.8b US$87.3b US$90.5b US$93.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x8 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 7.23% Est @ 5.81% Est @ 4.82% Est @ 4.12% Est @ 3.63% Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%  US$49.5k US$50.9k US$50.7k US$53.9k US$54.1k US$53.5k US$52.5k US$51.1k US$49.5k US$47.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$514b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$93b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.5%) = US$2.2t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.2t÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$1.1t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.6t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$529, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.073. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "content": "Summer has proven itself to be a wild season for markets, with high highs, low lows, and serious talk of more volatility and woes.\n\nBut the recent market slide doesn’t mean investors should call it a day and pull all their money out of markets.\n\n\"Consider potential opportunities during periods of crisis or dislocation,” Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist of AlphaSimplex told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (watch video above or listen here).\n\nThe former visiting scientist at MIT’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering studied markets, trading, and emotions. She also has firsthand experience with financial crises and investor reactions; she began her investment career in 2008 in a world reeling from the Great Recession.\n\nRather than react rashly, “the key thing right now is to watch the data and see if this could be a real crisis that unfolds where we have a bigger recessionary move,” she added.\n\nKaminski says it's good practice to stick with key investing themes such as AI, with a longer-term perspective.\n\nTo be sure, calm guidance from Kaminski is being put to the test this month.\n\nMarkets saw a surprise, mass sell-off on August 5 as fears of slowing US growth and the unwind of the Yen carry trade rocked sentiments.\n\nThe day saw Dow Jones Industrial Average lose 2.6%, the S&P 500 tanked 3%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3%.\n\nAll three major indices are still trading below their mid-July record highs, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nThe same for popular names like Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock is off by 13% since mid-July.\n\nIn June, Kaminski says, she “started to get concerned” when markets “started to see some pretty severe cross-asset sell-offs.\" Remarking that commodities moved from long to short signals and bonds moved from short to long signals, “both of these are classic risk-off potential recession trades,” she said.\n\n“Corrections often hint that a crisis could be impending,” Kaminski acknowledges, even though she is on the hunt for those aforementioned solid investable themes.\n\nUltimately knowing where to turn is anybody’s guess as September comes into view.\n\nIn an August 12 client note, Mislav Matejka, head of global equity strategy for J.P. Morgan, warned of potential further weakness as summer continues.\n\nThe laundry list of worries includes weakening economic activity, a resumption of negative earnings revisions, elevated geopolitical uncertainty, and concentration risk.\n\nMatejka calls out that the Fed “will start cutting, but this might be seen as reactive and behind the curve.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Lean on diversification,” Kaminski says.\n\nSounds about correct for this topsy turvy environment.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 14, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, NetApp, Inc. NTAP and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nMarket Volatility Continues: 4 Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip\n\nLast week, Wall Street witnessed one of the most eventful weeks in 2024. Markets were rattled on Aug 5, following the release of disappointing July payrolls data, reigniting fears that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nHowever, stocks have recovered most of the losses since then in a dramatic rebound that has greatly fizzled fears of a recession in the near term, following the release of a fresh jobless claims report that came in better than expected. However, the market volatility is far from over.\n\nOn Aug 5, the Dow gave up more than 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 finished 3% lower to record its worst day since 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 3.4%. The massive selloff was sparked by fears that the Fed may have held interest rates higher for too long, which has started taking its toll on the economy.\n\nTech stocks, which were so long driving the market rally, were the worst suffers of last week's market rout, with $1.5 billion of market capitalization being wiped out of the \"magnificent 7\" stocks.\n\nHowever, markets have since made a solid rebound. On Aug 8, all three major indexes rallied, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq jumping 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The S&P recorded its best close since November 2022.\n\nOnce again, the rally was driven by tech stocks. Markets closed the week on a high, recovering nearly all the earlier losses. However, the volatility is far from over as the Federal Reserve said that it will closely monitor inflation data before going ahead with the rate cuts.\n\nInflation has declined sharply over the past couple of months and investors are now awaiting the key consumer price index (CPI) reading for July.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is gearing up for its rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 25-50 basis point rate cut in September, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nLower interest rates typically help growth stocks, particularly tech stocks. Given this situation, it would be a wise decision to buy stocks at a bargain.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have chosen four top-ranked tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., NetApp, Inc. and NVIDIA Corp. that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world's largest social media platform.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.5% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Have Entered Correction Territory",
        "content": "Wall Street pays significant attention to the technology sector as tech companies typically deliver substantial returns to investors. However, the volatile nature of this industry means that tech stocks can especially short-term experience downturns. This volatility is typically a result of macroeconomic factors, company-specific challenges and market sentiment. Recently, the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC) has seen a decline of nearly 4% in July and another 6% in August, although it remains up 1.5% year-to-date.\n\nWhen the broader economy raises concerns, investors become increasingly wary of tech companies that deliver less-than-perfect growth rates. This earnings season, we are witnessing notable declines in share prices of many tech names. In most cases, they have failed to announce strong results that justify high valuation metrics.\n\nTherefore, in this article, we will discuss three tech stocks that have recently entered correction territory, each seeing a decline of more than 10% from their recent highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConfluent (CFLT) Cloud graphic with wires coming out of it symbolizing cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOur first stock is Confluent (NASDAQ:CFLT), a player in the real-time data streaming space. Confluent offers two main products: Confluent Cloud, a managed cloud-native service, and Confluent Platform, an enterprise-grade self-managed software. These products facilitate the connection and processing of data in real-time.\n\nAs we write, Confluent’s stock is trading around $20.00. Yet, the company has seen its stock price dip significantly in recent months. For example, over the past month, it has lost well over 20%. Similarly, since the start of the year, CFLT shares have shed more than 13%.\n\nConfluent went public in June 2021 amid high expectations, but it has struggled to maintain its lofty valuations as market conditions have changed. At present, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for CFLT stock is over 87x. Overall, its valuation metrics are a lot higher than the industry average.\n\nWhile Confluent continues to expand its customer base and revenue, growth has slowed compared to the earlier stages of its public life. This deceleration has made it challenging for the company to achieve profitability, with the most recent earnings reporting a loss of nearly $90 million.\n\nConfluent also faces competition from larger players like Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, which offer their own real-time data streaming solutions. Although Confluent’s platform is specialized, the presence of such formidable competitors raises concerns about its ability to capture market share in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Wall Street is still bullish on CFLT shares with a 12-month median price target of $31.00. Such an up move would mean a gain of well over 50%. Yet, we believe the immediate market sentiment appears cautious for tech stocks like CFLT, with concerns over competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nThe social media platform Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has also entered correction territory. The company is known for its visually-driven search and discovery engine. In late June, PINS shares were trading over $45, but now, Pinterest stock is around $29.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for Pinterest’s stock decline is the slowdown in user growth. After a pandemic-driven surge, the platform has struggled to maintain its user base, particularly in the U.S., its most lucrative market. There are concerns that Pinterest may have reached saturation in some areas, and its ability to reignite growth is uncertain. Following recent quarterly results, management provided a lower-than-expected sales outlook.\n\nIn addition to slowing user growth, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. Despite progress in building its advertising capabilities, it still lags behind social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In a tightening economic environment, advertisers remain cautious. And Pinterest has had difficulty convincing them it can deliver the same return on investment as its larger rivals.\n\nMoreover, the shift towards video content on social media platforms has not played to Pinterest’s strengths. At present, platforms like TikTok and Instagram continue to dominate the short-form video space. As a result, Pinterest’s relatively static content offering may be seen as less appealing to both users and advertisers.\n\nNonetheless, analysts have a favorable long-term opinion on PINS stock as evidenced by a price target of $44.00. Such a move would mean a return of about 52%. As Pinterest continues to navigate numerous challenges, its ability to innovate in a competitive market will be crucial for its long-term success.\n\nProcore Technologies (PCOR) A laptop displays the logo for Procore Technologies (PCOR).\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion with Procore Technologies (NYSE:PCOR), a cloud-based construction management software company, which went public in May 2021. Like many recent IPOs especially among tech stocks, Procore’s stock initially soared but has since entered correction territory.\n\nSince late July, PCOR shares have declined around 25%. A significant factor behind this decline is the market’s shift away from high-growth, unprofitable tech companies. More investors want to put their hard-earned cash into toward more stable, profitable enterprises.\n\nProcore has yet to achieve profitability, which concerns investors despite strong revenue growth. The latest earnings report showed a reduced net loss of $6.3 million, down from $52.9 million a year ago. However, revenue guidance for the next quarter fell short of expectations, and slowing customer growth raised concerns about future prospects. In the current high-interest-rate environment, unprofitable tech companies like Procore are particularly vulnerable, as the cost of capital rises and investors become more risk-averse.\n\nMeanwhile, the construction industry Procore serves faces challenges, including economic cycles, rising material costs, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions. These factors may limit construction companies’ ability to invest in new software solutions like Procore’s.\n\nYet Wall Street believes the decline should be over for Procore share price. Analysts currently expect PCOR stock to rally around 21% from the current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hedge funds have made notable adjustments to their portfolios, particularly within the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, according to recent data from Jefferies.\n\nWhile the overall weight of the top 16 stocks, dubbed the \"Sweet 16,\" saw minimal change, individual stocks experienced significant shifts.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are said to have emerged as the biggest beneficiaries, with hedge funds increasing their weightings in these two tech giants by 3.8% and 2%, respectively.\n\nThis increase in exposure reflects a growing confidence in these companies' ability to drive future growth, especially as Amazon continues to expand its cloud computing dominance and Microsoft leverages its strong position in AI, enterprise software, and cloud services.\n\nConversely, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) saw reductions in their portfolio weightings, with Netflix being cut by 2.9% and Meta by 2.4%. This shift indicates a cautious approach towards these two companies.\n\nJefferies also highlighted a broader trend where hedge funds are reducing their exposure to secular growth stocks, which now account for 49.5% of their portfolios, down from 54.5% at the end of April.\n\nThis reduction was primarily redirected into cyclical stocks, which saw their weightings increase by 4.8% to 52.5%, reflecting a shift towards sectors that are more sensitive to economic cycles.\n\n\"These investors are still OW Secular Growth by over 9%. All of the trim to Secular Growth went to the Cyclicals, as its weight was boosted by 4.8% to 52.5%,\" explained the firm. \"Hedge Funds are now OW this group by 3.7% after being slightly UW a month prior. The Bond Proxies are still held net short, just by a smaller margin at -1.9%.\"\n\nOverall, hedge funds are recalibrating their positions within the tech sector, favoring Amazon and Microsoft while trimming stakes in Netflix and Meta, amidst a broader move from secular growth to cyclicals.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHedge funds buying these two Magnificent 7 stocks while cutting Netflix and Meta\n\nAlaska Air, Hawaiian extend review period of proposed deal by a day\n\nDecentralized AI network Sahara raises fresh capital in Samsung-backed round\n\nView comments",

        "title": "META, NFLX, or AMZN: Which Growth Stock Is the Best Pick?",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates in September. This could increase investors’ focus on growth stocks. Companies in the growth phase invest significantly in their businesses. Consequently, they tend to benefit from lower borrowing costs when interest rates reduce. With this backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Meta Platforms (META), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN) against each other to find the best growth stock, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms shares have rallied about 46% year-to-date. The company’s upbeat second-quarter results and a better-than-anticipated outlook for the third quarter of 2024 reflected strong execution and a solid position in the digital ad market.\n\nIt is worth noting that Meta Platform’s Q2 earnings per share (EPS) surged 73% to $5.16, driven by 22% revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Remarkably, Q2 operating margin expanded to 38% from 29% in the prior-year quarter, fueled by the company’s streamlining and cost-cutting measures.\n\nMETA is experiencing the benefits of its significant artificial intelligence (AI) investments. AI is improving recommendations and helping users find better content on Meta Platforms’ apps. The company estimates capital expenditure in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion in 2024 and has cautioned that it expects a significant rise in capex next year to support its AI research and product development initiatives.\n\nIs META a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOn August 1, Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on META stock and boosted the price target to $563 from $550. The analyst views Meta as “the top AI play” in the consumer internet space.\n\nPost explained that his bullish stance is backed by the company’s leading infrastructure and large language model (LLM) capabilities, solid ad growth driven by core AI, and new multi-year growth prospects in generative AI.\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. At $549.35, the average META stock price target indicates 6.5% upside potential.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNetflix reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2024. The company’s revenue grew 16.8%, driven by its crackdown on password sharing and efforts to boost subscribers for the ad-supported tier. Global paid memberships increased 16.5% to about 278 million, with 8.05 million additions in the second quarter.\n\nStrong top-line growth and robust margins drove more than a 48% rise in the EPS. Despite the upbeat Q2 results, shares fell as the company’s Q2 free cash flow declined to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, Netflix’s Q3 revenue outlook fell short of expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix sees continued growth in its ad-supported plans, as they enable the company to offer lower prices to customers and create an additional profit stream through ad revenues. The streaming giant also continues to strengthen its content base to attract more customers.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for Netflix Stock?\n\nOn August 7, Jefferies analyst James Heaney reaffirmed a Buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of $780. The analyst believes that the recent pullback offers an attractive opportunity to buy the stock. He sees the possibility of the company raising its prices in the fourth quarter in the U.S.\n\nMoreover, Heaney believes the combination of an attractive content slate, including Squid Game 2 and NFL Christmas Day games, and price hikes could fuel further adoption of the company’s ad-tier plan.\n\nWall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on NFLX stock is based on 23 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NFLX stock price target of $704.97 indicates 11.4% upside potential. Shares have risen more than 30% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon shares took a hit after the company’s Q2 revenue missed analysts’ expectations due to sluggish growth in the retail business. In particular, the revenue of AMZN’s North America retail division fell short of expectations due to macro pressures and rising competition.\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit, delivered 19% revenue growth in Q2, while advertising revenue increased 20%. Amazon is optimistic about the prospects of its AWS business, as enterprises continue to shift to the cloud and modernize their infrastructure. AWS is also expected to gain from generative AI-led demand.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while Amazon’s Q2 net sales grew 10%, its EPS jumped 94% year-over-year to $1.26. The bottom line gained from the company’s aggressive cost-efficiency measures and enhanced inventory management.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon is making significant capital investments to bolster AWS infrastructure so that it can support the solid demand in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\n\nIs Amazon a Buy or Sell Right Now?\n\nWhile several analysts lowered their price targets for Amazon stock to reflect the subdued growth in retail business, Maxim analyst Tom Forte increased the price target to $251 from $238 and reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN stock.\n\nThe analyst noted that while Q2 sales were lower than consensus, the company’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin increased 420 basis points, driven by robust expense control and a favorable mix shift to the cloud.\n\nHe highlighted that AWS’ top-line growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on AWS’ strength, Forte increased his sales and EBIT estimates for FY24 and FY25.\n\nAmazon scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys versus one Hold recommendation. The average AMZN stock price target of $223.58 implies nearly 34% upside potential. Shares have risen about 10% so far this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Wall Street is highly bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon stocks, it is cautiously optimistic on Netflix. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants.\n\nAmazon’s cost-cutting measures, its dominant position in e-commerce, the massive opportunities for AWS, and the growing advertising business are expected to drive continued growth for the company.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

It recently expanded global partnership with Universal Music Group (“UMG”), solidifying a multi-year agreement that will enhance creative and commercial opportunities for UMG artists and Universal Music Publishing Group (“UMPG”) songwriters across Meta’s extensive network of platforms. \r\n\r\nBuilding on the companies’ 2017 landmark deal, this upgraded agreement integrates UMG’s music into Meta’s ecosystem, now including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Horizon, Threads and, for the first time, WhatsApp. \r\n\r\nBy focusing on fair compensation and addressing challenges such as unauthorized AI-generated content, Meta and UMG continue its collaborative efforts to enrich the music experience across Meta’s platforms.\n\nExpanding Portfolio Aid META’s Prospects\n\nMETA shares have surged 45.8% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s growth of 14.8%. The upside has been driven by a robust portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass and mixed reality device Quest 3.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

Quote\n\nMeta’s daily active user base across its apps exceeded 3.2 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Notably, WhatsApp surpassed 100 million monthly active users in the United States and Threads is approaching 200 million monthly active users.\r\n\r\nThe latest move is in sync with META’s growing efforts to strengthen the company’s platforms on the back of its strategic collaborations.\r\n\r\nIn June, Meta Platforms partnered with the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) to launch an AI Enablement for MSMEs program. The program aims to empower tech-enabled micro, small and medium enterprises in India through AI awareness, capacity building and access to resources.\r\n\r\nMeta also continues to enhance its AI capabilities, focusing on improving content recommendations, advertising experiences and AI-driven tools like Meta AI and AI Studio.\r\n\r\nThe launch of the AI studio in the second quarter of 2024 is a significant addition to META’s expanding AI capabilities. The AI studio enables creators to develop AIs that interact within apps across META’s service offerings.\r\n\r\nMETA’s advancement in generative AI capabilities with Meta Llama, which offers users more interactive and personalized experiences, has been noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe latest Llama 3.1 introduces the first frontier-level open-source model and features new, industry-leading small and medium-sized models. META is also developing Llama 4, which is anticipated to further enhance its capabilities in the future.\r\n\r\nMETA expects to invest significantly in the next few years in developing more advanced models and the most extensive AI services in the world.

        "content": "The performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" has been a bit of a mix bagged this year, with some performing well and others, not so much. This group of high-profile tech companies includes Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nFacebook parent Meta Platforms has been one of the better performers in this clique -- the stock is up by a solid 42% since the year started. However, the company is having a rough month -- shares are down 6% in the last 30 days. How long will the company keep falling? It's hard to say, but whatever happens in the short run, Meta Platforms is set to bounce back eventually and deliver excellent results in the long run.\n\nMultiple growth paths\n\nMeta Platforms' market capitalization is just under $1.3 trillion as of this writing. The company has produced market-beating returns in the past decade. However, the social media specialist still has plenty of growth opportunities. Consider its core business, advertising, where it generates most of its sales. In the second quarter, Meta Platforms' total revenue was $39.1 billion, up 22% year over year. The company's advertising revenue was $38.3 billion.\n\nIt seems like so long ago that the online advertising market experienced a slump, leading to poor financial results and slow (or nonexistent) year-over-year top-line growth for Meta Platforms. The tech giant, though, has rebounded remarkably since then. META Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nThere will be more issues of this kind in the future. Consumers decrease spending and businesses reduce ad budgets when the economy isn't doing well. However, in the long run, the online advertising market will maintain a solid upward trajectory, according to various projections by analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms has made this business even more productive thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Its AI-powered algorithm helps the company recommend Reels (short-form videos) that viewers enjoy watching on its platforms, Facebook and Instagram. The result has generally been that viewers spend more time watching Reels -- greater engagement among viewers leads to a more attractive platform for advertisers.\n\nSpeaking of AI, it represents yet another potential opportunity for the company. Meta Platforms' Llama, a large language model, is one of the best in the business and serves as the backbone behind its AI-powered assistant, Meta AI. According to the company, Meta AI is on track to becoming the most used AI assistant by year end.\n\nWhile Meta AI is free, Meta Platforms will eventually find ways to monetize its AI-related efforts. The company is also exploiting other opportunities, from paid messaging on WhatsApp to its ambitious metaverse initiatives.\n\nStory continues\n\nA wide moat\n\nMeta Platforms isn't the only company trying to profit from online advertising, AI, or the metaverse. Whatever other major source of revenue it goes after, chances are it will have plenty of competition. The tech giant should still be able to perform well, though, thanks to its competitive advantage.\n\nConsider Meta Platforms' brands -- Facebook and Instagram -- which are among the most famous and valuable worldwide, especially among social media companies. Both routinely feature on the list of the most visited websites worldwide.\n\nNext, Meta Platforms benefits from the network effect -- the value of its websites and apps increases with use. That's true for advertisers and consumers. Advertisers see Facebook as a more attractive hub to run ad campaigns, as the platforms have more users. Private users who want to connect with friends and family members have the best shot at it on the most popular websites, and the more popular it becomes, the more attractive it is to that end.\n\nMeta Platforms had 3.27 billion daily active users across its family of websites in June -- that's almost half the population of planet Earth that logs on to one of its apps every single day. This also grants Meta Platforms the opportunity to find ways to monetize its user base. Its initiatives might not always be successful. But it's much easier for a company with a large existing customer base to sell its users new products than it would be to attract customers unfamiliar with the business.\n\nMeta Platforms' Threads, an alternative to Twitter that launched about a year ago, already has 200 million monthly active users. Meta Platforms' vast ecosystem could also help its metaverse and AI ambitions become reality.\n\nAnother reason to buy the stock\n\nMeta Platforms is, without a doubt, a terrific growth stock to buy and hold. Earlier this year, the company announced it would initiate a quarterly dividend. It's too early to say whether Meta Platforms will become an excellent dividend stock, but it can certainly be an additional reason to buy the stock. Over the long run, reinvesting dividends can significantly boost returns. Meta Platforms should perform well, even with the slump it has experienced in the past month. The company's new dividend sweetens the deal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "With the recent global stock market rout fueled by sudden weakness in artificial intelligence companies, it’s an ideal time to consider offloading overhyped AI stocks.\n\nFew expected such a massive tumble at the stock market, but denying how overheated AI stocks had become is tough. AI has been the biggest investing theme over the past few years, driving the stock market to record gains. Yet, many on Wall Street predicted a major correction in AI stocks, with investors demanding tangible AI-driven operational improvements.\n\nConsequently, the Magnificent Seven stocks took a huge hit, wiping out nearly $3 trillion in market value. Moreover, the risks are even greater for investors holding AI stocks with massive or overhyped operating losses. With the possibility of a broader market correction, these overvalued stocks could see major declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, it’s best to prune your portfolio from these high-risk assets AI stocks to sell, offering little upside ahead.\n\nSnap (SNAP)\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), which operates the Snapchat social media platform, was once a thriving player in the tech space, enjoying its heyday when competition was scarce. However, the social media player has been up against stiff competition with the rise of TikTok and industry titans like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) dominating the space.\n\nOver the past year, Snap’s advertising business has taken a sizeable hit, leading to a significant drop in its top-and-bottom-lines. Additionally, SNAP stock has been down more than 88% in the past three years, including a drop of 47% so far in 2024. Amidst the struggle, it is making major investments in AI and augmented reality.\n\nThe firm’s second-quarter results painted an unattractive picture of its advertising business, triggering a decline in its stock price. While its management was quick to blame the market conditions, the lackluster performance is linked to company-specific issues. Advertising sales were up roughly 10% from a year ago, which pales compared to its peers. Moreover, this underwhelming growth comes when some economic indicators point to a recession, which could weigh down ad spending further.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) established a bellwether position in the AI-powered home robotics space. Despite the early burst of excitement surrounding the stock, IRBT shed much value on the back of its dwindling fundamental performance. Moreover, following its stock, it is now trading at a fraction of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) takeover offer following the deal’s collapse earlier this year due to EU regulatory scrutiny.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fallout has been severe, with iRobot laying off more than 30% of its workforce, underscoring deeper operational challenges. As a stand-alone entity, there’s little to get excited about with iRobot, with sales and profit margins consistently in the red over the past several years.\n\nDespite restructuring efforts, the firm remains in a precarious situation, with its cash position dropping 78% from 2021 to $108.5 million as per its latest quarterly update. Moreover, the intense competition and eroding market share in the robotic vacuum space aggravate the company’s bleak outlook.\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) BigBear.ai (BBAI) is a leading provider of high-speed decision-making technologies. They specialize in AI-driven analytics and solutions for critical missions\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nBigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI)is up against major challenges in the AI sector, with its stock expected to drop further. Despite offering various AI-driven analytics solutions, the company’s financials have taken a turn for the worse.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, BigBear.ai just a 3.4% increase in sales from a year ago, missing estimates of $6.75 million. Moreover the company missed estimates on its top-line for the fifth consecutive quarter. Additionally, it missed bottom-line estimates in three out of the past five quarters.\n\nStrategically, BigBear.ai struggled to hold its own against fierce competition from well-established AI giants and agile startups. Additionally, by acquiring Pangiam Intermediate, BigBear.ai aims to stand out in terms of visual AI and biometrics capabilities.\n\nHowever, these efforts have yet to translate into financial performance. Moreover, its aggressive acquisition strategy has added to its massive debt burden, heightening concerns about dilution. It has a $195 million in long-term debt and just $72 million in cash.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: August 2024",
        "content": "Before considering which semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip, it’s important to understand why chip stocks have been falling since the beginning of July. Consider three intertwined reasons.\n\nFirst, recession concerns are back. The latest job numbers show a tightening labor market, and the July reading on inflation is due the week of August 12. Global markets are starting to believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t be able to cut interest rates quickly enough to prevent a recession.\n\nGeopolitical concerns are also bedeviling investors. The outcome of this November’s election is likely to have significant ramifications in the ways the U.S. relates to China and/or Taiwan. That could put additional pressure on inventory levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis means investors are starting to sell some winners either to build up cash or to rotate into other stocks. Because of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, chip stocks have been some of the biggest winners in 2024.\n\nBut when does a sell-off become overdone? Every investor must answer that for themselves. But for a variety of reasons, the following three companies look like attractive semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 111% in 2024. It’s also down 22% in the 30 days ending August 9, 2024. That the first statement is true, doesn’t make the second statement less true. Shares of NVIDIA have pulled back substantially, but is that reason to buy semiconductor stocks on the dip?\n\nThose in the No camp would point out that NVIDIA has announced a delay in chip production. It also may be discontinuing its popular and inexpensive GeForce RTX 3060 chip. The belief is that any production delay opens the door for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) that are eager to capture market share. Many companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are actively looking for alternatives to NVIDIA chips.\n\nBut that presumes that the competition is ready with chips to take that share. It also speculates the economy remaining strong enough so that what corporations have noted as intention to spend on AI infrastructure matches what they actually spend.\n\nWhile that may affect NVIDIA as much as other companies, the company and NVDA stock are well positioned to overcome any short-term impacts.\n\nARM Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe one-year anniversary of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) going public is approaching. And it’s been quite a year. Shares are up 55% since the initial public offering (IPO) but are down more than 32% in the last month. A solid first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings report may have put a floor on the sell-off. But it’s not lifting ARM stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo understand what could be driving this, it’s important to comprehend ARM’s role in chip manufacturing. Specifically, the company doesn’t make or produce its own chips. Rather, it’s a designer for chips and software which collects licensing fees and royalties on its architectures and intellectual properties (IPs).\n\nIn the company’s recent earnings report, it offered cautious guidance. That is, it maintained its current guidance. As noted in the introduction, that’s not what investors want to hear right now, particularly if they’re going to pay a premium for chip stocks. This could be the reason for short interest in ARM stock is up in the last 30 days.\n\nOn the other hand, about 99% of premium smartphones are powered by ARM CPUs. That should put a floor on the company’s fundamentals which makes this a buyable dip.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there’s such a thing as an undervalued chip stock in 2024, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) may be it. AMAT stock is up only 37% in the last 12 months, which seems downright undervalued compared to other chip stocks. However, the stock is down more than 20% in the last month. That may signal one of the best opportunities for semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nLike ARM, Applied Materials doesn’t make chips, but it provides chipmakers with innovative materials and engineering solutions. In May 2023, Applied Materials announced its intention to build its Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) center. The company touts this as “the world’s largest and most advanced facility for collaborative semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment research and development (R&D).”\n\nThe project won’t be ready until 2026. However, the company reports earnings in mid-August. A strong report should be just what the company needs to move it higher, particularly since AMAT stock appears to have found support around $193.09 at market close on August 12, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Many stocks have entered corrections after strong rallies to start 2024. Some of these stocks present long-term opportunities for patient investors while others stocks will continue to dip. Seeing what analysts say about publicly-traded corporations can provide some clues about the future direction of those stocks.\n\nAnalysts regularly adjust their price targets after earnings and in light of news developments. These individuals and their firms regularly stay on top of individual stocks, sectors and the broader economy. Analysts have more time and expertise in stock investing than the average investor, which is what makes it good to consider what they say.\n\nGranted, you should conduct some of your own due diligence instead of solely relying on an analyst’s insights. However, these seven growth stocks look like they have more catalysts left that can spark future gains. Capitalizing on these “Strong Buy” stocks during dips can lead to attractive long-term returns. Discover the investment opportunities that are likely to rally in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has outpaced the stock market for several years. The company’s stock is up by 9% year-to-date and has almost tripled over the past five years. A recent stock correction has raised the yield to 0.74% while resulting in a 34.5x P/E ratio.\n\nThe tech giant is a top beneficiary of the AI boom on the software side. Copilot allows Microsoft to tap into more verticals and expand its presence. For instance, Copilot for Security expanded the company’s market share in the cybersecurity industry. Microsoft’s Q4 FY24 revenue and net income growth rates decelerated a bit but still came in at healthy levels. Revenue increased by 15% YoY to reach $53.7 billion while net income was up by 10% YoY.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud continues to be a critical component of the company’s long-term plans. Cloud revenue increased by 21% YoY to reach a record $36.8 billion. The conglomerate also reported impressive growth rates in other business segments, such as Productivity and Business Processes.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) makes almost all of its revenue from online advertisements. The company is diversifying into other revenue streams like augmented reality and AI. While those opportunities can eventually pan out in meaningful ways, the company’s underlying business model continues to excel.\n\nFacebook’s parent company reported 22% YoY revenue growth and 73% YoY net income growth in the second quarter. The company has 3.27 billion daily active users across its social networks which is a 7% YoY increase. As more people flock to Meta’s family of apps, advertisers get more opportunities to showcase their businesses. That also means more revenue for Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadcount remained stable, only down by 1% YoY. It’s a notable achievement, given the company’s ability to still generate 73% YoY revenue growth. Meta has become more efficient, and it’s been able to give out quarterly dividends to its investors. The tech giant also invests billions of dollars into stock buybacks each quarter, further raising the stock price.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers a good blend of value and growth. The stock trades at an 18x P/E ratio and offers a 1.18% yield. Shares are up by 26% year-to-date and have gained 89% over the past five years. The fintech firm benefits from rising revenue and profit margins as younger consumers create new cards with the company.\n\nRevenue increased by 9% YoY in the second quarter while net income jumped by 39% YoY. Revenue has been in the high single-digits or low double-digits for several quarters, and net income has often outpaced it. American Express closed out the quarter with a 20% net profit margin. Guidance suggests that profit margins will continue to expand.\n\nConsumers will use their credit and debit cards in any economy. These cards are more convenient and secure than paper cash, and many of them also have enticing reward programs. American Express is a leading credit and debit card issuer that offers a reasonable valuation and promising growth prospects.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe AI chipmaker stands to benefit from a potential partnership with OpenAI that can boost its sales. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) isn’t relying on OpenAI to succeed in the booming artificial intelligence industry. The company generated a record $3.1 billion from its AI products in Q2 FY24 in an effort that resulted in 43% YOY revenue growth across the company. The VMware acquisition has been a boon for Broadcom’s infrastructure software solutions.\n\nThe stock has been a consistent outperformer before artificial intelligence become mainstream. Shares are up by 37% year-to-date and have more than quintupled over the past five years. Broadcom also offers a 1.42% yield and has maintained an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nA recent 10-for-1 stock split brought more attention to Broadcom, but shares are now in a correction. This opportunity looks promising for long-term investors are Broadcom gets closer to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom isn’t the only corporation that initiated a stock split. In fact, it seems like stock splits are making a comeback, with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) leading the way. The fast food restaurant chain announced a 50-for-1 stock split earlier in the year. The split brought more attention to the stock, but shares are currently in the middle of a correction.\n\nMany fast food restaurants and consumer discretionary companies have faced pushback from higher prices. However, Chipotle defied industry headwinds by reporting 18.2% YoY revenue growth in the second quarter. Even better, the Mexican Grill chain reported 33% YoY net income growth, resulting in a 15.3% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle has been no stranger to price hikes, but it is a healthier alternative to many fast food restaurants. The company’s reputation for offering quality food relative to its competitors has given it more pricing power. That should please investors, on top of the stock’s 240% gain over the past five years.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has a sprawling presence that includes more than 10,500 stores and clubs in 19 countries. The company has almost half of its stores located in the U.S. and has 2.1 million employees. Walmart stock has outpaced the stock market with a 28% year-to-date gain. Furthermore, shares are up by 90% over the past five years and offer a 1.22% yield. The stock trades at a 29x P/E ratio.\n\nThe company’s Q1 FY25 results suggest that the gains should continue. Consolidated revenue increased by 6.0% YoY to reach $61.5 billion. Meanwhile, net income more than tripled YoY to reach $5.1 billion, resulting in a 3.16% net profit margin.\n\nE-commerce sales growth was a major highlight, delivering a 21% YoY increase in sales. Walmart’s advertising segment also did well, generating 24% more revenue than the same quarter last year. Ads only make up a small percentage of Walmart’s total revenue, but this segment can improve the company’s profit margins.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the AI leader for several years and made it on every investor’s radar in 2023. It’s hard to ignore a stock that has more than doubled year-to-date that has logged a 2,621% gain over the past five years. However, investors still believe that Nvidia can continue to rally. It was briefly the world’s most valuable company and may reclaim that title within a few years.\n\nThe AI chipmaker’s revenue and net income continue to surge at levels that other mega-caps can’t compete with. Sales increased by 262% YoY to reach $26 billion, while net income surged by 628% YOY. Nvidia’s profit margins have accelerated dramatically over the past year and came in at 57.1% in Q1 FY25.\n\nThe artificial intelligence is projected to maintain a compounded annualized growth rate of 36.6% from now until 2030. There’s already speculation that Nvidia’s next earnings report will be a smash hit that acts as the next big AI catalyst. Investors are excited about Nvidia stock, and the corporation has earned the enthusiasm of its analysts. Nvidia can soar to all-time highs if it reports good results for Q2 FY25.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, AVGO, and NVDA.

        "content": "Change is the only constant within the stock market. The economy can look bleak one day and appear strong within a few months. Stocks that previously lost a lot of value can become the next hidden gems.\n\nHowever, it’s possible for a stock to lose its appeal among investors. While growth stocks can become less attractive for several reasons, the subsequent losses can become overstretched. It’s possible for a falling rock to look extremely attractive after enduring significant losses. However, investing in these stocks requires a contrarian mindset, as sentiment is quite negative toward these types of stocks.\n\nIt’s amazing how quickly fortunes can change within a year. For some of these stocks, fortunes have only changed within a few months. These growth stocks once looked like they were on top of the world before tumbling. Now, they present reasonable entry points for long-term investors. Discover the fallen star growth stocks that look ready to rebound.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew stocks have received as much attention and headlines as Super MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI). The stock went parabolic in January and continued an unstoppable ascent until early March. However, there were red flags during the run-up. The stock suddenly had a lofty valuation after staying under the radar for many years. The high P/E ratio made it harder to mask the company’s declining profit margins.\n\nInvestors saw that first-hand when Super Micro Computer dropped by more than 20% after releasing Q4 of fiscal year 2024 earnings. While most investors agree that revenue growth and sales guidance were impressive, declining profit margins stole the show, prompting the sell-off. The announced 10-for-1 stock split didn’t do much to minimize concerns.\n\nFiscal 2025 revenue is projected to almost double year-over-year (YOY) at the midpoint. The concern about profit margins remains, but Super Micro Computer suddenly trades at a 25 P/E ratio after losing more than 50% from its peak. Also, shares are down by more than 40% over the past month. SMCI has endured a lengthy descent since mid-March, but growth prospects make the current valuation attractive. Revenue growth will likely outpace net income growth, but profits are still expected to increase meaningfully YOY.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite their star role in a global tech outage, Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) shouldn’t be dismissed as an investment, especially with the recent crash. The stock is down by roughly 40% from its all-time high. It was only a few weeks ago when Crowdstrike was a booming growth stock that was up by more than 50% year-to-date (YTD). However, the stock has shed its gains and is in the red in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig mistakes like these happen, and they present long-term buying opportunities. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) endured Cambridge Analytics while American Express (NYSE:AXP) navigated the Salad Oil Scandal in the 1960s. It still takes a lot of effort for customers to switch, and few companies can compete with Crowdstrike. The company has been professional with its handling of the tech outage and looks like it will regain trust over time.\n\nCrowdstrike will report earnings on August 28. Investors will then get a better understanding of the current state of the business. Before the debacle, Crowdstrike regularly reported high annual recurring revenue growth and had soaring profit margins. It’s a matter of when, not if, Crowdstrike returns to those good times.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) makes it easier for people to learn new languages while offering additional subjects like math and music. The stock has delivered impressive growth rates over several quarters. But there has been a mismatch with the company’s financial performance and its stock returns. Shares are down by 13% YTD but look like they can double within the next 3-5 years.\n\nSecond quarter revenue jumped by 41% YOY to reach $178.3 million. Net income came to $24.4 million compared to $3.7 million in the same quarter last year. Surging profits will make Duolingo’s P/E ratio more attractive. Margins should continue to increase since Duolingo is a software company instead of a firm that has many brick-and-mortar locations.\n\nThe educational app has 103.6 million monthly active users and 34.1 million daily active users. “Streaks” on the app are converting more of its users into daily active users. Furthermore, as people use the app more often, they become more likely to become paid subscribers. Duolingo saw a 52% YOY increase in its paid subscribers, reaching 8.0 million paid subscribers in the process.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI, CRWD, and DUOL.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Microsoft 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Microsoft is the second-largest company in the world with a market cap of just under $3 trillion as of this writing. The tech giant has managed to reach this position thanks to its solid presence across multiple applications such as cloud computing, its popular Windows operating system, and workplace collaboration tools.\n\nLately, artificial intelligence (AI) has turned out to be another solid growth driver for Microsoft, contributing to an acceleration in the company's growth in recent quarters. However, Microsoft isn't the only tech giant that is using AI as a springboard to boost its growth. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are also benefiting from the booming adoption of AI in their respective industries.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the prospects of Nvidia and Meta Platforms over the next decade to find out why they have the potential to overtake Microsoft's market cap in the long run.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is currently the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft with a market cap of $2.56 trillion. The semiconductor specialist's value has shot up remarkably since the end of 2022, when it became evident that its data center graphics processing units (GPUs) will play a central role in the proliferation of AI.\n\nMicrosoft partner OpenAI used Nvidia's GPUs to train ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot that exploded in popularity following its launch in late 2022. Since then, tech giants across the globe have been lining up to buy Nvidia's AI GPUs to train and deploy AI models. This has allowed the chipmaker to control more than 80% of the AI chip market, leaving very little for rivals such as AMD.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh estimates that Nvidia could generate a whopping $200 billion in data center revenue next year with demand for its next-generation Blackwell AI chips reportedly stronger than expected. That would be a significant jump over the $47.5 billion data center revenue Nvidia reported last year.\n\nMeanwhile, consensus estimates indicate that Nvidia's data center revenue could increase to $140 billion next year, which would still be a significant jump over its revenue from this segment last year. For perspective, AMD is expecting to sell $4.5 billion worth of data center GPUs this year, which tells us just how dominant Nvidia has been in this market.\n\nGiven that Nvidia will be releasing a new AI GPU every year, as compared to its earlier plan of refreshing its lineup every two years, it could continue commanding a solid share of the AI chip market after 10 years. With the overall market for GPUs expected to be worth $1.16 trillion in 2034, according to Future Market Insights, Nvidia's strong standing in this market sets it up for robust growth over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to clock an annual growth rate of 42% over the next five years. That's higher than the 13% annual earnings growth that Microsoft is expected to deliver over the same period.\n\nNvidia's huge end-market opportunity and its dominant share suggest that it could keep growing at a faster pace than Microsoft beyond the next five years, potentially over the next decade. As such, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia eventually overtaking Microsoft's market cap after 10 years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is currently the seventh-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.25 trillion, which means that it is quite some distance away from Microsoft. However, the impressive pace at which Meta has been growing recently thanks to the growing adoption of its AI-powered advertising tools suggests that it could maintain a healthy pace of growth over the next decade.\n\nAccording to eMarketer, digital ad spending could increase by 13.2% in 2024. Meta is on track to grow at a faster pace than the industry it operates in. The company's revenue in the first six months of the year increased by 24% to $75.5 billion. Its revenue forecast of $39.75 billion for the current quarter would translate to year-over-year growth of 16%, which would again be higher than the pace at which digital ad spending is forecast to grow this year.\n\nMeta's ability to drive greater returns for advertisers with the help of AI-powered ad campaigns is helping the company attract more ad dollars. Management said on the recent earnings conference call that U.S. advertisers witnessed a 22% jump in returns after adopting Meta's AI-powered ad tools such as Advantage+.\n\nThese AI tools are allowing advertisers who are using Meta's offerings to improve audience targeting, drive incremental purchases from that audience, and reduce acquisition costs. Meta witnessed a 10% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered in Q2, along with a 10% improvement in the average price per ad.\n\nThe global digital ad market is expected to be worth a whopping $1.76 trillion in 2034, up from this year's estimated revenue of $467 billion, according to Prophecy Market Insights. Meta is expected to deliver $161 billion in revenue in 2024, which means that it could end the year with a third of the digital ad market under its control.\n\nIf the company continues to grab a bigger share of this lucrative end-market opportunity in the long run, its revenue could increase significantly in the future. Assuming Meta could bump its digital ad market share to 40% in 2034, its revenue could hit a whopping $704 billion. That would be more than four times the company's projected 2024 revenue.\n\nGiven that the U.S. technology sector has a price-to-sales ratio of 7, Meta could witness a significant expansion in its market cap in the long run if it trades at that valuation. So, Meta Platforms indeed has the potential to become a bigger company than Microsoft in the coming decade thanks to its improving influence in the digital ad market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Augmented Reality Stocks That Could Enhance User Experiences",
        "content": "The concept of augmented reality (AR) has overtaken virtual reality (VR) in much of the tech speculation sphere. That’s because the overall applications of augmented reality lend themselves more to day-to-day usage than VR’s mostly entertainment-focused sphere. For example, the most commonly touted sectors that AR could enhance are education, retail, healthcare and defense. With these industries backing the sector’s growth, there are a few augmented reality stocks to watch in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, many augmented reality stocks on this list come from companies with broader revenue streams than just AR, meaning investors get more security for their speculation into AR technology. Beyond this, investors can closely follow AR technology’s impact on these companies by looking into how their stocks respond to news of its development. Thus, whether by improving productivity or disrupting existing technological trends, these three augmented reality stocks could become lucrative long-term positions for investors.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve often discussed Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) slowdown in innovations in the consumer tech industry as a sign that the stock’s best days might be behind it. After all, the tech giant continues to release minor revisions to well-established products, lacking any serious market movers like it once produced. Yet, the company’s foray into augmented reality, which it insists on calling “spatial computing,” Vision Pro, is still somewhat of a nonstarter for most consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo matter what it’s called, Apple’s move into AR stocks signals two things: it recognizes the market’s future potential and plans to refine its latest design over time. Just as with its previous products, Apple will make gradual improvements until it can reduce costs. This presents a chance to invest in a profitable blue-chip stock as Apple enters the AR market.\n\nMoreover, with the trend of releasing a budget model, usually under the “SE” or “Air” moniker, Apple could bring augmented reality to a much broader set of consumers should its applications justify it.\n\nLenovo Group (LNVGY) The logo for Lenovo Group Ltd (LNVGY) is displayed on a tall building front.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLenovo Group (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), which has been widely recognized for its affordable consumer laptops, is making strides into the premium enterprise market with its augmented reality headset. This move likely aligns with predictions of the Chinese AR market reaching $12.4 billion by 2029, leveraging Lenovo’s strong position domestically. Even U.S. companies may find Lenovo’s specialized headset hard to overlook.\n\nCurrently, Lenovo offers the ThinkReality A3, a dedicated AR headset designed for manufacturing and engineering applications. This wearable glasses-style device excels at projecting real-time overlays into the user’s field of view, enabling features such as live training instructions for manufacturing equipment and virtual model sharing for design teams.\n\nIn essence, Lenovo is introducing a high-end product tailored to a niche of business users within its broader consumer electronics market. This AR venture holds both potential and security, making Lenovo a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSomewhat of an early adopter of virtual and augmented reality technology, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been relatively bullish about its products in the sector. For now, its recent partnership with EssilorLuxottica (OTCMKTS:ESLOY) to produce AR-powered Ray Bans has been slow to gain traction from day-to-day users. These slower adoption curves and high costs for the early AR glasses models keep the tech out of reach of the average person. Nevertheless, Meta continues to persist in its investment and development strategies, hoping to push AR adoption to a point where it becomes a tech mainstay.\n\nRecently, the company’s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, gave an interview in which he claimed the next iteration of Meta’s AR glasses will be a “big deal” as the company gets closer to revealing the upcoming generation. Yet, despite this confidence from Zuckerberg, the prototype won’t be available to the wider public until a consumer version is released in 2027. As such, buying Meta stock now would mean investing in the long-run of AR tech.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Why Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META) Outperformed Big Tech This Earnings Season",
        "content": "The earnings season for the June quarter has been quite volatile for large-cap tech firms. With challenging comparisons due to rapid growth driven by AI in recent years, investors have been focusing on how companies manage to expand margins while increasing capital expenditures. As a long-term Meta Platforms (META) bull, I remain optimistic, as the company’s Q2 results not only exceeded expectations but also surpassed those of other AI tech giants, helping it be an outperformer this earnings season.\n\nMeta’s Q3 guidance further boosts confidence, indicating that AI spending is positively impacting short-term results despite tough comparisons, which strengthens the long-term bull case. In this article, I’ll review Meta’s key Q2 highlights and explain why its approach to AI appears to be effective, addressing both short-term concerns and long-term expectations for shareholders.\n\nMeta’s Q2 Results Were Better Than Expected\n\nWhen I wrote about Meta’s earnings expectations in a previous article, I took a cautious stance due to the typical volatility after earnings. As expected, volatility hit, but this time, it was positive for META’s bulls.\n\nMeta’s performance was less surprising, given its recent track record of beating estimates. Still, it’s impressive, considering the tough comparisons. For Q2, analysts expected a 20% revenue increase, down from 27% in Q1. Meanwhile, Meta delivered $39.1 billion in revenue, a 22% annual increase, surpassing Wall Street’s $38.3 billion forecast.\n\nThis growth indicates that Meta is capturing more market share in advertising as advertisers shift from traditional methods to digital platforms like Instagram and Facebook. The success of Meta’s short-form video platform, Reels, in countering TikTok’s popularity also plays a role.\n\nRevenue growth led to a 58% jump in operating income, which reached $14.8 billion from $9.4 billion last year. With an operating profit margin of 38%, Meta’s model is impressive, especially considering that most of its services are free.\n\nDespite its massive market share, Meta increased its family daily active users by 7%, hitting 3.27 billion. This broad user base and increased engagement provide a strong competitive edge. Ad impressions across its apps grew by 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher user engagement and more ads being shown.\n\nNotably, Meta achieved these strong operational metrics with fewer employees. The company reduced its headcount by 7,800 in Q2, highlighting Mark Zuckerberg’s effective cost management and contributing to the significant rise in operating income.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s What Sets Meta Apart in the Current Earnings Season\n\nA key concern for Q2 across Big Tech, especially amid the AI boom, were capital expenditures (CapEx) and guidance for both the top and bottom lines. For instance, major players like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) disappointed investors with high spending on AI that did not lead to a corresponding increase in cloud segment margins.\n\nConsequently, the big question becomes, what return will Meta see from this spending, and when will those benefits materialize?\n\nTo answer that question, it’s important to note that Meta’s focus on AI is to improve its ad business and consumer behavior on its platforms. Then, secondarily, the company expects to drive revenue growth by scaling up new AI-based products like Meta AI and AI Studio.\n\nGiven this clear focus, Meta’s Q3 outlook helped alleviate concerns about inconsistent returns. The company projected revenues between $38.5 billion and $41 billion for Q3, signaling a 20% increase despite tough comparisons. This has sent a message that the AI investments are already paying off, particularly in how Meta manages CapEx and operating expenses.\n\nAdditionally, Meta raised its annual CapEx forecast from $35–$40 billion to $37–$40 billion, but this didn’t negatively impact the stock price. The stock performed well, jumping around 7% after the Q2 results, while other Big Tech peers, except for Apple (AAPL), saw share prices fall following earnings reports.\n\nMeta also warned that CapEx will increase even more by 2025. While this sounds significant, the current data doesn’t indicate long-term concern. On the contrary, Meta is seeing revenue growth, more daily active users, and increased ad impressions, all pointing to higher user engagement and effective AI recommendations.\n\nThe bottom line is that, in my opinion, Meta is currently the top-performing Big Tech company when it comes to managing AI growth expectations. It has adeptly balanced shareholders’ short-term expectations with its long-term growth ambitions.\n\nIn fact, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia—referred to as the “Godfather of AI” by tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush—has credited Meta Platforms and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, with leading the field of AI. This recognition is due to Meta AI’s integration across the company’s social media platforms and the successful launch of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI project.\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong for Meta?\n\nInvestors in Meta should be prepared for price swings and an aggressive investment strategy. While Meta posted strong Q2 results despite tough comps, challenges are expected to grow each quarter. With CapEx rising until at least 2025, the future returns of this high spending remain uncertain.\n\nCurrently, META stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24x, near its five-year average of 23x. I believe this valuation is reasonable for long-term investors, but short-term volatility may still occur.\n\nIs META Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nMeta Platforms stock is rated a Strong Buy by Wall Street analysts. Out of 28 analysts covering the stock, only two are bearish, two are neutral, and the remaining 24 are bullish. 12 analysts have raised their price targets for META, with the average META stock price target now at $549.35. This suggests upside potential of 6.7% based on the latest share price.\n\nSee more META analyst ratings\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nMeta delivered a solid quarter recently, surpassing market estimates and offering promising Q3 guidance despite tough comparisons ahead. This performance indicates that its AI investments have already paid off and will likely continue to benefit the company in the latter half of the year. Currently, Meta stands out among Big Tech firms for its effective balance of short-term growth and long-term potential amid the AI boom.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia's Earnings Set For 'Drop The Mic' Moment As Investors Anticipate 'Massive' AI Demand Forecast From CEO Jensen Huang, Says Tech Bull\n\nThe upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be a pivotal moment for the company, according to a prominent analyst.\n\nWhat Happened: Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, predicts that the earnings report, scheduled for Aug. 28, will be a significant event for the tech industry.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

Major tech companies like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have committed to continued investment in AI infrastructure, which represents over 40% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the “Magnificent Seven” mega-cap stocks, including Nvidia, have been at the forefront of market volatility. Despite a 30% drop from their five-year peak valuations, they remain 50% above their five-year troughs. This group, which includes major players in IT, communication services, and the electric vehicle industry, continues to wield significant influence over the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFurthermore, notable figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)  have shown confidence in Nvidia’s future by purchasing additional shares. Pelosi recently disclosed acquiring more Nvidia shares while selling part of her stake in Microsoft.\n\nLastly, early tech investor James Anderson has predicted that Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, driven by the growing demand for AI chips. This bullish outlook has contributed to Nvidia’s shares soaring by 117% since the beginning of the year.\n\nPrice Action: Nvidia’s stock closed at $104.75 on Friday, down 0.21% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock inched up 0.019%. Year to date, Nvidia’s stock has surged by an impressive 117.46%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 5% on Monday, leading a rally in tech stocks as Wall Street continud to debate whether a recent slump across the semiconductor sector has gone too far.\n\nOn Monday,Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya noted Nvidia is one of the firm's top \"rebound\" picks amid what he expects to be a comeback for semiconductors to end 2024.\n\n\"Our base case remains for a [semiconductor] rebound likely in Q4 as seasonal headwinds dissipate,\" Arya wrote in a note to clients.\n\nArya noted that Broadcom (AVGO) and KLA Corporation (KLAC) could also benefit from a rebound as they in addition to Nvidia are the, \"most profitable vendors in their respective end-markets.\"\n\nThe PHLX Semiconductor index (^SOX) is down nearly 18% in the last month, while Nvidia stock is off more than 15% over the same time period. The sector has been swept up in a rotation by market participants out of large-cap technology.\n\nArya reasons volatility is likely to continue through Nvidia's next earnings release on August 28 and into September, which is historically the worst month of the year for semiconductor stocks Arya notes that the current upward trend in semiconductor stocks has only been underway for four quarters, while prior runs have typically lasted for closer to 10 quarters.\n\nNvidia stock in particular has been under pressure amid growing concerns about the distribution of its Blackwell chip. Last week, The Information reported Nvidia's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting big customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META).\n\nNvidia then issued a statement stating its next-generation Blackwell chip \"production is on track to ramp\" in the second half of the year. And Wall Street analysts believe the issue will be resolved.\n\n\"If it's really a supply or timing issues, I think most investors are willing to kind of look through that,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. \"If it was a demand issue, I think we'd have other issues here with with Nvidia. But but from our perspective, we think they'll beat and raise [earnings guidance], we don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.\" FILE PHOTO: A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri maintained his Buy rating on the stock and a $150 price target in a note to clients on Monday, while also remarking that he believes Blackwell customer volume shipments are likely delayed four to six weeks \"at most.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Lead customers should have first Blackwell instances stood up in April 2025 timeframe,\" Arcuri wrote. \"AI labs are still upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix - both bullish indicators.\"\n\nAdditionally, Arcuri argued the market may be underestimating Nvidia's future earnings growth. For now, Arcuri believes the market is currently pricing in peak earnings growth for Nvidia in 2025, but Arcuri argues 2026, \"seems more likely to be up again given our customer discussions.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the new gold rush of the 21st century, making the case for the best underrated AI stocks to buy. With the market souring on the AI trade in the past month, investors should pay attention to these 3 companies in August.\n\nOver the next decade, AI will transform the world as we know it. Similar to the birth of the internet in the early 1980’s, many investors were skeptical of it and its true potential. However, as demand skyrocketed it was clear its potential was limitless.\n\nThe phenomena seems very similar to now where many investors, including Wall Street analysts, undervalue the impact that it would have on the global economy. Additionally, AI’s impact could be orders of magnitude greater than any technological innovation in human history. As the companies continue to build the infrastructure, applications, and technology to accelerate its growth early will have an opportunity to become extremely wealthy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top 3 underrated AI stocks set for an unprecedented rebound in 2024!\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has solidified its positioning in the AI race in 2024. After the company’s ‘’year of efficiency’’ in 2023, Meta’s strategic investments in AI and the metaverse are paying off in great fashion.\n\nMeta has become a major player in artificial intelligence in 2024 and will continue to make its competition shake in its boots. Over the last year, the company overcame significant financial hurdles and has hit the ground running. CEO Mark Zuckerberg made crucial decisions, which involved cutting costs to strengthen its liquidity. Moreover, the company saw record revenue and free cash flow in the 2023 fiscal year. After a strong start to the year, Meta’s financial performance in the second quarter remained strong.\n\nRevenue increased 22% year over year to $39.07 billion, with net earnings up 73% to $13.46 billion. Additionally, family daily active people rose 7%, including a 10% bump in its average price per ad. Meta’s continued strong growth and stellar financial performance make it one of the top underrated AI stocks to buy now.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is the runner up on the list that investors should keep a close eye on in 2024. The stock’s more than 30% drawdown in July presents a unique opportunity that long-term investors simply cannot miss.\n\nDell Technologies is not as exciting as many of the other AI companies that have been in the headlines this year. However, the company’s infrastructure is the backbone of powering modern AI solutions, especially in hyperscale data center and cloud environments. Dell’s AI-powered infrastructure includes servers, storage solutions, and networking products. The products power the most demanding AI workloads, which is important when working with extremely large datasets.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for these products os at an all-time high, as AI continues to drive new growth opportunities.  In Q1 FY25, revenue increased 6% year over year to $22.2 billion. In addition, net earnings swelled 65% year over year to $960 million, with servers and networking revenue hitting a record $5.5 billion. With AI adoption in the PC, data center, and cloud environments accelerating, Dell remains one of the top underrated AI stocks to buy in August.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the final company on the list amongst the best underrated AI stocks to buy. The company’s huge plunge in July is overdone, and the company is set to rebound in the back half of the year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is a hidden gem in the AI server market that is just getting started. In the month of July, the stock plunged in excess of 40% after the AI stock rout and a miss on its EPS estimates in the fourth quarter. However, underneath the surface, its full-year financial results and strategic investments in manufacturing capacity expansions tell a different story. The 2024 fiscal year included record revenue, earnings, and an inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 Index.\n\nRevenue skyrocketed 110% year over year to $14.94 billion, with net earnings swelling 89% to $1.2 billion.

        "content": "WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish billionaire Rafal Brzoska and his wife plan to sue Meta over fake advertisements on Facebook and Instagram that feature his face and false information regarding her circulating on the social media platforms.\n\nTheir move would be another in a series of quests initiated globally to hold the internet giant accountable for ads that keep appearing despite users informing the company about problems.\n\nBrzoska, the creator and the biggest shareholder of Polish parcel locker company InPost, said he notified the company of the problem beginning of July, but it failed to find a solution.\n\n\"We plan to file a private lawsuit against Meta... We have not yet determined in which jurisdictions we will sue Meta. We will decide in the next few weeks,\" Brzoska told Reuters.\n\n\"...we are considering absolutely all scenarios, including a lawsuit in the United States if there is inaction in Europe,\" he added.\n\nBrzoska said he and his wife would demand that Meta stop benefiting from the promotion of content that violates their rights and a large compensation donated to a charity, adequate to the level of advertising revenues from spreading this type of disinformation.\n\nMeta was not immediately available for comment.\n\nLast week the President of the Personal Data Protection Office obliged Meta Platforms Ireland Limited to stop the display of false advertisements using real data and the images of Brzoska and his wife on Facebook and Instagram in Poland for three months.\n\n(Reporting by Anna Koper; Editing by Franklin Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Says AI Stocks Like Meta Platforms (META) are in ‘Bubble Land’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms is a key player in the Mag. 7 group of stocks which, according to Elliott Management, are in a bubble.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "You don’t always have to accept a sky-high valuation as part of doing business with growth investing. Some stocks present captivating growth opportunities while presenting reasonable valuations for their investors.\n\nHowever, valuation is only one piece of the puzzle. Many telecom stocks have some of the lowest P/E ratios in the stock market, but these same companies don’t grow by much. Most of them are stagnant with very limited upside and high yields to compensate for fading growth prospects.\n\nThe best stocks don’t just have reasonable valuations. They also have rising revenue and profit margins. Strong financial success and growth catalysts can make a stock with a 50 P/E ratio look undervalued.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, a stock with an 8 P/E ratio can look overvalued if the c company’s revenue and profits are shrinking.\n\nInvestors looking for undervalued stocks may want to consider these promising opportunities for long-term growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still undervalued, despite being one of the largest corporations on the planet. The stock has a $1.3 trillion market cap, but it only has a 26 P/E ratio.\n\nFurthermore, net income growth is booming. The company reported a 73% YOY increase in profits during the second quarter of 2024. Soaring profits suggest that the P/E ratio will go even lower.\n\nNet income isn’t the only thing going up. Meta Platforms also reported 22% YOY revenue growth as consumers continue to click on advertisements.\n\nAdditional ad spend during the Olympics plus the extra social media engagement from the games can result in a strong third quarter. The company has 3.27 billion daily active users spread across its family of apps.\n\nMost Wall Street analysts are on board and believe that the stock can rally from current levels. Meta Platforms is rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 11% upside.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) may come as a surprise if you haven’t heard anything about the retailer for several years. However, this stock has done more than just beat the market.\n\nIts year-to-date gains are higher than every Magnificent Seven stock, except Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and its 5-year gains are better than every Magnificent Seven stock except Nvidia and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe American lifestyle retailer has posted a 63% year-to-date gain and a commanding 848% gain over the past five years. The stock’s rally caught many people off guard, but the valuation still looks good. Abercrombie & Fitch trades at a 18.48 P/E ratio, and profit margins have been soaring.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn just a few quarters, net profit margins went from mid single-digits to firmly above 10%. That also comes with three consecutive quarters of more than 20% YOY revenue growth, including 22.1% YOY growth in the first quarter.\n\nNet income per diluted share came to $2.14 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch even has $864 million in cash along with a $7.6 billion market cap. More than 10% of the company’s market cap is based on its cash position.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has a lower valuation than most credit and debit card issuers, despite having the better financials. The fintech firm trades at a 17.7 P/E ratio and offers a 1.18% yield.\n\nAmerican Express has maintained an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for several years, including a 17% dividend hike earlier this year.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the market with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares are also up by 90% over the past five years. The low valuation helps, but a P/E ratio is only good or bad based on a company’s financials.\n\nLuckily, American Express regularly delivers rising revenue and profit margins. The Q2 2024 earnings report revealed that the company delivered 9% YOY revenue growth. Meanwhile, net income surged by 39% YOY to reach $3.02 billion.\n\nAmerican Express closed out the quarter with a 20% net profit margin. Recent earnings results suggest that profit margins will continue to expand in the years ahead.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ANF.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 12, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Palantir PLTR and Meta Platforms META.\n\n2 Companies Actually Benefiting from AI: PLTR, META\n\nAI this, AI that.\n\nWe’ve heard it all from companies in their quarterly releases about the technology, with some seemingly shoving the term into their commentaries as a buzzword. But the obvious question remains – is anybody actually benefiting?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nSeveral companies, including Palantir and Meta Platforms, are actually reaping the benefits of AI, as reflected by their quarterly results. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nPalantir Reports Record Profit\n\nPalantir’s quarterly release was filled with positivity, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue soared 27% year-over-year, whereas EPS climbed 200%. The company builds software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations.\n\nThe company’s platform continues to be highly attractive, reflected by 41% year-over-year customer growth. Impressively, PLTR closed over 27 deals worth $10 million throughout the period, further reflecting the snowballing demand.\n\nThough strength was broad, the company’s US commercial sales were notably bright, growing 55% year-over-year alongside an 83% customer increase. The CEO delivered a notably bullish statement following the print, stating –\n\n‘In Q2 2024, we generated $159 million in revenue in the U.S. commercial market alone, an increase of 55% from the same period the year before. The growth rate was even more significant, at 70% year-over-year, when excluding strategic commercial contracts. And the persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no sign of relenting.’\n\nAnalysts have adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the robust release, with the now $2.8 billion expected suggesting a 21% jump.\n\nThe stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, further reinforced by its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nMeta Platforms Delivers Stunning AI Statement\n\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The stock remains a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook reflecting bullishness across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, ‘We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\"\n\nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\n\nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\n\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 21.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile companies continue to seemingly throw around the AI buzzword in their quarterly releases, several, including Palantir and Meta Platforms, are actually benefitting from AI, with the trends expected to continue.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's biggest music label, announced on Monday an expanded agreement with Facebook-parent Meta Platforms to create new opportunities for its artists and songwriters across Meta's social platforms.\n\n\"UMG was the first major music company to license Facebook back in 2017 and this new agreement will further expand the possibilities for music within the meta ecosystem,\" said the company that represents artists such as Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.\n\nThe agreement concerns all of Meta's major platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and, for the first time, WhatsApp.\n\nThe renewed agreement also addresses the issue of compensation for artists and songwriters, UMG said.\n\nIn late July, the music label said it had ended a partnership with Meta for the streaming of premium music videos. It said this type of product was less popular with Facebook's user base than other music products.\n\nThe $54 billion group behind more than a third of the market had reached a new licensing agreement with TikTok in May, restoring its songs and artists to the social media platform.\n\nLast month, UMG's shares shed more than 23% in a single day after weaker than expected streaming and subscription revenues for the second quarter disappointed investors.\n\n(Reporting by Alban Kacher in Gdansk; editing by Milla Nissi)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are These the 2 Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index have both performed extremely well despite the latest dip. A lot of credit for the market's run can go toward the ongoing AI boom that has helped lift the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nBut right now, it can easily be argued that these companies trade at expensive valuations. For investors looking to put some money to work in what are considered to be disruptive, tech-driven, and industry-leading enterprises, I can see why the current situation could be discouraging.\n\nIt's best to remain optimistic. I believe two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), actually look like smart buying opportunities today. Let's take a closer look.\n\nDigital ad giants\n\nIt's almost impossible to overstate the wide reach and dominance of these two businesses. Alphabet, which owns some of the most popular internet properties on Earth, has six products and services that are each used by 2 billion people. Its flagship offering, Google Search, has a virtual monopoly on the market, controlling 91% share.\n\nBut don't discount Meta's standing. The social media powerhouse ended the second quarter with a whopping 3.27 billion daily active users. This number continues rising, increasing by 7% compared to the year-ago period.\n\nI'd argue that because of their unmatched scale, there might be no two businesses that are as immune from competitive threats as Alphabet and Meta. Even if an entrepreneur had unlimited capital to develop a new search engine or social media app, it seems impossible that they could bring on users in massive quantities.\n\nThis clearly shows that Alphabet and Meta benefit from powerful network effects, perhaps having the widest economic moats around. And their ability to collect data is a massive advantage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, advertisers love this. That's why these two companies combined generate 55% of worldwide digital ad revenue. According to Grand View Research, the industry is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 15.5% between now and 2030, leading to meaningful expansion potential for Alphabet and Meta, especially as they continue to invest aggressively in artificial intelligence.\n\nFinancial prowess\n\nAlphabet and Meta have been wonderful investments in the past. This is a direct result of their fantastic financial performance, with both businesses registering strong revenue and net income growth historically.\n\nTheir profitability is through the roof. In the past five years, Alphabet's and Meta's operating margins have averaged a ridiculous 26.6% and 35.1%, respectively. And in the three-month period that ended June 30, they each produced tens of billions of dollars in operating cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe balance sheets are also in pristine condition. Alphabet has a net cash balance of $87 billion, while Meta has $40 billion. Investors can sleep well at night knowing that there is almost no financial risk in owning these companies. Additionally, they should always be able to operate from a position of power, playing offense and investing in growth regardless of the economic climate.\n\nWhen it comes to capital returns, both Alphabet and Meta have typically leaned on share buybacks. However, they both started paying dividends recently, which yielded under 0.5%.\n\nReasonable valuations\n\nIt's not too late to scoop up these dominant businesses. In fact, they are the two cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to buy based on a popular valuation metric.\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet and Meta trade at forward P/E ratios of 21.3 and 23.7, respectively, both sizable discounts to the Nasdaq-100 index. Considering all of the outstanding qualities described above, these two stocks look like no-brainer buying opportunities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AdTech stocks.\n\nIt goes without saying that the advertisement technology industry happens to be an exciting and ever-evolving sector, as digital advertising continues to dominate the market trends and remains at the forefront when it comes to strategic marketing. According to industry data by Allied Market Research, the global AdTech market was pegged at $748.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This demonstrates a CAGR of ~14.7% from 2022 to 2031.\n\nThis growth comes off the back of growing digital and internet penetration, increased usage of advanced technology like AI and machine learning, improved prospects for the gaming industry, and growth in social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. Some of the top trends dominating the AdTech industry include higher usage of connected TV (CTV) advertising, in-app advertising, and interactive ads.\n\nGrowth prospects of the AdTech industry\n\nThe AdTech market has been bifurcated into solution, advertising type, size of an enterprise, platform, etc. The AdTech industry includes a wide range of companies and products, such as demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, data management platforms (DMPs), and more. Experts are of the view that the global supply-side platform (SSP) market size should touch ~$117.32 billion by 2033. This means that the industry should compound at ~13.3% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is expected to stem from technological advancements, higher consumer demand, and supportive government policies.\n\nIn the same vein, the demand side platform software market size should touch US$120.1 billion by 2033 on the heels of an improved trend of programmatic advertising and, the need for better targeting along with measurement capabilities for online ads. While the AdTech industry seems promising, inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) makes it even more appealing.\n\nAI's Role in AdTech – Opportunities and Challenges\n\nGlobal AdTech industry continues to prepare for the complete deprecation of third-party cookies by Google, which makes up ~65% of the web browser market share. This transition seems to be a critical step for enabling user privacy and data security. Artificial Intelligence, because of its capability to process vast amounts of data, should play a crucial role.\n\nResearch suggests that ~54% of businesses believe that AI offers advertising cost savings and efficiencies and ~30% of marketing professionals decided to earmark more than 40% of their marketing budget to campaigns that are AI-executed. The advent of smart speakers, voice search, and podcasting can help advertisers in creating fresh avenues to connect with target audiences with the help of audio and voice technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile advertisers can exploit the opportunities available in the AdTech industry, they need to be wary about challenges such as Ad fraud. These frauds are caused mainly because of bot traffic, domain spoofing, or ad stacking. Some other challenges include inventory quality, ad creativity, and brand safety.\n\nAI and ML are revolutionizing digital advertising by enabling advertisers to assess vast amounts of data in real time. As a result, the advertisers can make data-driven decisions for optimizing ad campaigns. Advertisers now use algorithmic advertising, personalization, and performance metrics to maximize ROI.\n\nAI algorithms help in automating media buying, making sure that ads reach the target audience. Personalized ads can be delivered using AI-powered recommendation engines and these engines enable real-time tracking, which can help make quick adjustments to fuel success.\n\nThe global AdTech industry is expected to compound in the mid-teens range over the next decade. Given that it's still early in its growth story, now is the time to look at some of the best AdTech stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the holdings of SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. For the purposes, we sifted through Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for 1Q 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the world's largest online social network, having more than 3.6 billion monthly active users. These users engage with each other in a variety of ways, exchanging messages and sharing news events, etc.\n\nThe company released its 2Q 2024 financial results, wherein, its revenues jumped 22% YoY to $39 billion, with ads revenue coming at ~$38.3 billion. Ads revenue saw a jump of ~22% YoY, and the management of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is quite optimistic about ads revenue for 3Q 2024.\n\nIn May, the company unveiled a slate of new Gen-AI-powered tools and services. These services focus on helping businesses improve their ad performance and visibility on the company’s popular social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s management highlighted that spending is expected to significantly increase in 2025 because of its infrastructure costs. Well, this increase is understandable as this is related to the development of a leading large language model. This powers GenAI technologies. The company continues to focus on improving its ad revenues by innovating in a way that can bring more personalization to each user. This should help Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) increase the price per ad.\n\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler upped their price objective on the shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from $545.00 to $575.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 1st August. As of the first quarter, the stock is held by 246 hedge funds with stakes worth $46.9 billion.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the best AdTech stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Nowto see the other AdTech stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering strong returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Has a Bold Vision for Meta's Chatbot. Is the Stock a Buy Based on What We've Seen So Far?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has billions of active users across all of its platforms. Between WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, it has a huge user base that it can test new products and services on. Its Threads platform grew to over 100 million users in less than five days after launching last year, largely due to it being incredibly easy for Instagram users to try it out.\n\nThe company looks to be leveraging its users once again to help it jump on the next big bandwagon: artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it as a huge opportunity, and while Meta may be a bit late to the game, it has some ambitious targets ahead. And if it achieves them, that could make an already hot stock even better.\n\nWill Meta's AI become bigger than ChatGPT?\n\nArtificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has been publicly available since November 2022 and it has ignited a lot of excitement around AI and how it can transform how people do tasks and potentially even eliminate the need for certain jobs. There are reportedly 200 million monthly active users on ChatGPT. But Zuckerberg thinks Meta's AI can surpass that -- before the end of the year.\n\nMeta recently released a new AI model, Llama 3.1, which it says performs better than the latest GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multiple benchmarks. The model is open-source -- meaning anyone can see and update the code -- which could attract many developers and potentially help make the model better over time. The AI will be integrated within the company's applications and even virtual reality headsets, making it easy for Meta's vast user base to gain exposure to it and potentially become regular users.\n\nGiven the billions of users Meta's applications have, surpassing ChatGPT in number of users may not be all that difficult, even if the goal is for that to happen before the end of the year.\n\nWhy this could be a big win for Meta\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Meta can get a lot of people to use its AI platform, especially if it's easily accessible within WhatsApp, Facebook, and other popular applications. The real test, however, will be how long people use it for, and whether it will lure them away from ChatGPT. While people may accidentally click a button to launch the Meta AI or just test it out to see what it does, and that will surely bump up the user count, for it to really be a significant game changer for the business, it will need to show that it's better than ChatGPT or that it can at least be a viable alternative. That could take a bit longer to prove.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf that happens and users do indeed see value in Meta's chatbot, the company could find ways to monetize the product. ChatGPT, for instance, offers a subscription service to a more advanced version of its chatbot. Microsoft's Copilot is available within its Office software for an additional subscription price as well.\n\nPlus, if Meta's AI can enhance the user experience within its existing applications, leading to greater usage and more users overall, that could also draw in more advertising dollars.\n\nMeta has already been growing at an impressive rate and an AI boost could generate even more bullishness around the stock. For the three-month period ending June 30, Meta's sales grew by 22% to $39 billion. And its net income rose by 73% to $13.5 billion. Not only did the average price per ad increase by 10% during the quarter, but the number of ad impressions across its family of apps also rose at a similar rate. The stock is up about 40% so far this year.\n\nIs Meta Platforms stock a buy?\n\nMeta's business has been doing well, but I would hold off on buying the stock until it can prove that its new AI assistant can truly be the success that Zuckerberg envisions. There are a lot of big tech companies launching their own chatbots and it may not be easy to lure users away from one onto another.\n\nIf Meta's AI does prove it can win over users, however, then it could make the tech stock a no-brainer buy as it could accelerate the company's already strong growth rate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\n\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\n\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\n\nWest Coast's Smartphone Giant: AI Stock or Not?\n\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\n\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 2 AI Stocks That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "Several of the market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) companies -- including Nvidia, Broadcom, and Super Micro Computer -- all split their stocks or announced their plans to do so over the past year. Those events didn't actually make their high-flying stocks fundamentally cheaper, since they simply split their existing shares into smaller slices, but they still attracted a lot of attention from retail investors who wanted to buy entire lots (100 shares) of a stock instead of just a few. They also made it easier to trade options, since a single contract is tethered to a single lot, and for the companies to pay their employees with more flexible stock-based compensation plans.\n\nSo for long-term investors, stock splits don't matter too much because they don't change the company's business model or valuations. But forward stock splits are still usually a sign of a well-run company -- since its stock price has risen so much that it needs to be pruned. ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are two AI-driven companies that fit that description and might be ripe for a split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems for manufacturing the world's smallest and densest chips. The Dutch company's stock has nearly quadrupled over the past five years as the top chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel -- scrambled to stay in the \"process race\" to produce more advanced chips.\n\nASML's stock now trades at about $840, but it's been years since its last stock split. It actually did three forward stock splits during the dot-com bubble and a reverse stock split in 2007. However, another forward stock split might generate some fresh attention for ASML -- which is often overshadowed by better-known stocks like Nvidia.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, ASML's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to rise at a CAGR of 13% and 21%, respectively, as it grapples with tighter restrictions on its exports to China. However, the expansion of the AI market could offset a lot of that pressure.\n\nASML's stock isn't expensive at 25 times next year's earnings, and its monopolization of a crucial chipmaking technology makes it one of the easiest ways to profit from the secular growth of the semiconductor and AI markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, leverages AI to analyze its user data and craft targeted ads. It's also developing its own AI accelerator chips to gradually curb its dependence on Nvidia's chips. It served 3.27 billion daily active people across its four main apps in its latest quarter.\n\nMeta endured some tough macro, competitive, and platform-related challenges (mainly from Apple's iOS update in 2021), but it still grew its top line at a CAGR of 16% from 2020 to 2023. It recovered by attracting Chinese advertisers, expanding Reels to tackle TikTok, and strengthening its first-party data collection tools to counter Apple's privacy-oriented changes.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 15% and 23%, respectively, even as it expands its unprofitable Reality Labs segment to produce more augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) products. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 22 times this year's earnings.\n\nMeta's stock trades in the low $480s, but it's the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has never split its shares. A stock split might generate some fresh buzz from this social media titan that still looks undervalued relative to its growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Earnings Growth in US Finally Showing Up Outside Tech Megacaps",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- As another quarterly earnings season from Corporate America enters its final stretch, this much is clear: The long-awaited recovery in the companies that were left out of the artificial-intelligence frenzy has finally begun.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test When Climate Funds Pay for Highway Expansion\n\nSigns of the turnaround are unmissable. For several quarters, profit growth in the seven biggest technology companies was driving gains for the S&P 500 Index. That is about to change, as the rest of the stocks in the benchmark, excluding the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” are on pace to deliver their first profit growth since the fourth quarter of 2022, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n\n“This broader earnings strength is a positive as it provides portfolio managers more opportunities beyond just a few stocks and provides a more balanced market,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services.\n\nThough more than 80% of the S&P 500 members have already reported, major bellwethers for the health of the US consumers — such as Home Depot Inc., Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. — have not yet announced their numbers. The clues they reveal about consumer spending will be closely watched as traders remain jittery about the possibility of an economic slowdown. Also, Nvidia Corp., which is arguably the most important stock for investors interested in artificial intelligence, is scheduled to report later this month.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of earnings season so far:\n\nBroadening Growth\n\nThe biggest takeaway has been slowing profit growth of large-cap companies, as smaller names started to hit their stride.\n\nThe BI data show that earnings for S&P 500 companies, excluding the Magnificent Seven, are set to grow 7.4% in the second quarter from the same time a year ago, after five straight quarters of declines. Profits for the mega-cap tech group — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Tesla Inc. and Nvidia — are set to rise 35%. It’s a brisk pace, to be sure, but one that represents a sharp slowdown from even bigger gains over the past year.\n\nEarnings strength spreading out to the wider market can add more fuel to what has already been a drastic rotation away from large-cap stocks and into smaller companies and market laggards. The investor shift was first sparked by a cooler-than-expected inflation read in July.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The broadening-of-earnings theme was a key part of why we thought equity performance would broaden out beyond the Mag-7 this year,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity trading strategy at Citigroup Inc. “More companies generating earnings would make EPS growth less scarce and support broader participation in stock performance. That has only happened in fits and starts this year for the most part, which has been frustrating for investors.”\n\nAI Enthusiasm Shaken\n\nThe big disappointment came from just the corner where both expectations and stocks valuations have been running high. Results so far from the major players in artificial intelligence have been lukewarm at best, spreading concern that returns from billions of dollars in AI investments may not come anytime soon. Amazon.com, Microsoft and Alphabet all disappointed, with their outlooks either missing expectations, or being short on specifics.\n\n“The risk is that because there hasn’t been that boost to revenues, companies are getting a little antsy and might cut back on AI projects (or) spending,” said Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Michael Casper. “Especially if the economy is weakening and they’ve got to keep margins up, AI spend will be the first thing to get curbed because it generates little revenue.”\n\nFacebook parent Meta bucked the trend, citing strength in AI as its second-quarter revenue beat expectations. Apple also said new AI features will spur iPhone upgrades in the coming months, helping it reemerge from a sales slowdown. Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary of AI spending, reports on Aug. 28.\n\n“The key focus for hyperscalers this quarter was AI monetization,” said Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America. “Those with clear monetization trends have been rewarded, while others have been penalized.”\n\nIn short, she said: “AI hype days are over. Now it‘s a ‘show me’ story.”\n\nRevenue Misses Galore\n\nWhile earnings have been a bright spot, revenue misses have been more frequent this time around, grabbing the attention of market watchers. Companies reported revenue below estimates 21% of the time, compared with 20% a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n“The overall earnings beat rates are running close to the long-term average, but the revenue beat rate is below average,” Truist’s Lerner said. “Thus, companies are pulling other levers, such as on the expense side, to meet their numbers.”\n\nOutlook Improves\n\nOverall, executives expressed optimism for future earnings, with BI’s data trending positive for the third quarter. In fact, the gauge of earnings guidance momentum — derived in part from the ratio of increased versus reduced guidance — is expected to be positive in the July-to-September period for the first time since 2021.\n\nData from Bank of America showed the same trend. Strategist Subramanian noted that analysts’ average estimates for both 2024 and 2025 are holding up. “This suggests that analysts are relatively comfortable with their estimates,” she said.\n\nStock Reactions Get Intense\n\nIt has been a volatile earnings season for share prices. Both good and bad news were met with intense stock reactions, more so than usual.\n\nData from Citi found that the average S&P 500 company posting second-quarter earnings has so far moved 4.9% in either direction on the day of the announcement. That’s well above the historical average of 3.3%. Moreover, earnings-day moves in just one direction — higher or lower — were also the widest in 12 years, the data show.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Why Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Instead Of Buying the Dip On \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Like Amazon, Consider This Growth Stock",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla -- have captured the spotlight this earnings season. And for good reason -- the group has been instrumental in leading the market higher in 2023 and 2024.\n\nAfter blowing analyst earnings estimates out of the water, Meta Platforms surged as high as 11% on Aug. 1 -- only to give up most of those gains by close on Aug. 2 as a widespread sell-off in mega-cap growth stocks rippled through markets.\n\nA weak unemployment report and Amazon's disappointing guidance were some of the catalysts driving the broader market sell-off. And although some investors may be tempted to buy the dip on Amazon, Meta looks like an even better growth stock to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta's impressive numbers\n\nCompared to the same quarter in 2023, Meta's revenue surged 22%, the operating margin was 38% compared to 29%, and net income jumped 73%. Meta continues to justify price increases, with ad impressions up 10% across its Family of Apps and average price per ad also up 10%. Daily active people across its apps was 3.27 billion for June 2024, increasing 7%.\n\nMeta narrowed its third-quarter revenue guidance to a range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. For context, third-quarter 2023 revenue was $32 billion -- meaning the midpoint of its guidance would be a 24% year-over-year increase. That's a significant acceleration compared to the 11% revenue jump between Q3 2022 and Q3 2023.\n\nMeta expects full-year capital expenditures to be $37 billion to $40 billion -- up from its prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. \"While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence [AI] research and product development efforts,\" said Meta in its earnings release.\n\nOverall, Meta is growing its top line and expanding margins, and expects to accelerate spending to fuel growth.\n\nFull steam ahead\n\nIn a relatively short amount of time, Meta adjusted to the threat of TikTok -- which in hindsight was probably a net positive for Meta, because it led to innovation and better monetization through Reels and other improvements. Meta has transformed itself into about as close to a perfect business as you can get. It has a dominant position across its apps. It is growing operating income faster than sales, which has led to margin expansion. And that's despite losing billions on Reality Labs each quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nReality Labs refers to the company's other investments, like Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, virtual reality headsets, and more. For the six months ended June 30, Reality Labs brought in $793 million in sales and had an operating loss of $8.33 billion, whereas the Family of Apps had revenue of $74.73 billion and earned $36.999 billion in operating income.\n\nWithout being weighed down by Reality Labs, Family of Apps would have an operating margin of nearly 50% -- which is wildly impressive.\n\nThe losses on Reality Labs would be inexcusable at just about any other company. But Meta can afford it -- which is a testament to the strength of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta's Family of Apps performance is so strong that the company can afford to accelerate its spending, buy back stock, and pay a dividend.\n\nMeta's research and development (R&D) expense is up more than three-fold in the last five years, which has outpaced the growth of operating income and revenue.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, Meta is converting nearly a third of revenue into net income, while supporting growing capital expenditures and a massive buyback program that is roughly six times the size of its dividend expense. META Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nTo top it all off, Meta has an impeccable balance sheet -- finishing the quarter with $32.05 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $26.04 billion in marketable securities, compared to just $18.39 billion in long-term debt.\n\nWidening the lead\n\nWhen a company is producing lights-out results, it's easy to get enamored by the numbers. While Meta deserves a lot of credit for its results, and attention should go toward the financials, it's also important to think about the big picture.\n\nMeta is not just doing well now -- it's laying the foundation for sustained growth. It is one of the best examples of a company that is aggressively investing in AI and making those investments pay off. Meta has developed AI tools to help with content creation and engagement with followers, make purposeful ads, and deliver accurate analytics. At its core, Meta's business model is focused on increasing engagement so that advertisers view its digital real estate as more attractive.\n\nIn second-quarter 2024 compared to the same quarter two years ago, Meta increased its advertising revenue by more than $10 billion, or 36%, to $38.33 billion. For context, Alphabet's Google Search combined with YouTube generated $57.12 billion in revenue in Q2 2024 -- which was just a 19% increase in two years. Meta is innovating at a rapid rate, and its results prove that its efforts are paying off.\n\nWhat impresses me the most about Meta is that it is still holding back. It didn't have to implement its first-ever dividend earlier this year or buy back nearly as much stock. Its trailing 12-month R&D expense is $40.3 billion, compared to $30.8 billion in buybacks. It's on pace for around $5 billion a year in dividend expenses, meaning that if it didn't have a capital return program, it could be spending around 85% more on R&D.\n\nThat margin for error gives Meta an invaluable advantage in the age of AI. It means the company can afford to make plenty of mistakes, take risks, and try out new projects. Reality Labs has not paid off, and yet the company is still thriving. But if Reality Labs does eventually contribute to positive operating income, it could take Meta's valuation to new heights.\n\nSo much growth at such a low price\n\nMeta's market position and ability to invest in innovation position it as the top digital advertising destination. If the company keeps it up, I would expect Meta's Family of Apps to overtake Alphabet's Google Search plus YouTube advertising revenue within the next five years.\n\nDespite the growth and the capital return program, Meta Platforms is not an expensive stock. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25. That makes Meta less expensive than the S&P 500 or consumer staples like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\n\nAdd it all up, and Meta is arguably one of the top growth stocks, and top stocks in general, to buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Weekly market recap: Here's how S&amp;P 500 sectors performed last week",
        "content": "US stocks concluded the week with a modest rebound, with the S&P 500 index rising by 0.5%, therefore marking the strongest consecutive daily gains of the year.\n\nThe rebound in stocks helped to offset much of the losses from earlier in the week, which began with a massive selloff, the most severe trading day since 2022.\n\nDespite the initial market turbulence and concerns about a potential economic downturn, recent corporate earnings reports have provided some insight into persistent trends, such as reduced consumer demand.\n\nThe week saw mixed performance across sectors, with consumer discretionary and materials sectors declining, while information technology and communication services outperformed the broader market.\n\nMaterials was the worst-performing sector (-1.7%) while Energy and Industrials both gained +1.2%.\n\nThe technology sector experienced mixed results, with semiconductor stocks slightly down. Notable losses were seen in shares of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, while Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX), and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) saw gains.\n\nThe software subsector, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase, bolstered by strong performances from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Inc. Tech hardware also advanced, led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).\n\nIn the communication services sector, media and entertainment companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) contributed to a 1.0% sector gain. Telecommunication services also saw an uptick, with Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc reaching new heights.\n\nHealthcare stocks mirrored the broader market's performance. The pharmaceuticals subsector was a standout, with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares surging after a blowout earnings report. However, the biotechnology and life sciences segments saw declines, with Gilead Sciences Inc (NASDAQ:GILD), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) facing setbacks.\n\nFinancials slightly outpaced the market, with advances in banks, insurance, and financial services. JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), and American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) were among the top gainers, while Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) Inc saw declines.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector aligned with the market, with the automobiles and durables&apparel subsectors making modest gains. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) were among the notable climbers. The real estate sector saw gains in REITs, with Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) Inc reaching record highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnergy stocks mostly rose following a jump in WTI crude oil prices, which were up 1% on the week. While the oil, gas, and consumable fuels subsector saw some gains, energy equipment and services faced a decline. Utilities also lagged behind the market, with electric utilities and multi-utilities experiencing mixed results.\n\nIndustrial stocks remained mostly unchanged, with transportation suffering losses and aerospace&defense gaining. The materials sector underperformed, with chemicals making slight gains, while construction materials, metals&mining, and containers&packaging faced declines.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 could mean for U.S. energy stocks\n\nHow to rebalance your portfolio to hedge against market risks\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) closed on Friday with a weekly loss of 2% as investors continue to sort through what's been a challenging last several weeks for the year's hottest trade.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts this week remained confident in the long-term prospects for Nvidia, which is now down about 20% over the last month and off more than 25% from its record closing high.\n\nEarlier this week, Piper Sandler analysts called out a \"tremendous opportunity\" to buy Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and ON Semiconductor (ON) following the sector's recent sell-off.\n\nSome analysts also took the opportunity to upgrade the stock during this sell-off.\n\n\"I think that for 2025 ... things are fairly well set,\" New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. \"We know roughly how much [hyperscalers] expect to grow capex.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms defeated an appeal by Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., challenging its censorship of Facebook posts that spread misinformation about vaccines' efficacy and safety.\n\nIn a decision on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, said the nonprofit did not show that Meta worked with or was coerced by federal officials to suppress views challenging \"government orthodoxy\" on vaccines.\n\nChildren's Health Defense sued in 2020, saying that Meta had violated its constitutional rights by flagging \"vaccine misinformation\" as false, and taking away its right to advertise on Facebook.\n\nMeta's actions included prohibiting users from sharing claims that COVID-19 vaccines don't work, and referring viewers of Children's Health Defense posts to the World Health Organization for facts about COVID-19.\n\nCircuit Judge Eric Miller, appointed to the court by Republican former President Donald Trump, wrote for the appeals court that Meta was a \"purely private\" company with a First Amendment right not to use its platform to promote views it found distasteful.\n\n\"Meta evidently believes that vaccines are safe and effective and that their use should be encouraged,\" Miller wrote. \"It does not lose the right to promote those views simply because they happen to be shared by the government.\"\n\nThe court also rejected Children's Health Defense's claims against the Poynter Institute and Science Feedback, which help Meta evaluate the accuracy of Facebook content.\n\nKennedy, an independent U.S. presidential candidate, helped argue Children's Health Defense's appeal. Meta removed the group's accounts from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022.\n\nChildren's Health Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither Meta nor lawyers for the Menlo Park, California-based company immediately responded to similar requests.\n\nCircuit Judge Daniel Collins, also a Trump appointee, dissented from Friday's decision, saying that Children's Health Defense could seek an injunction on its free speech claims. He agreed that its other claims, including for monetary damages, should be dismissed.\n\nFriday's decision upheld a June 2021 ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco.\n\nThe case is Children's Health Defense v Meta Platforms Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16210.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Companies Actually Benefiting from AI: PLTR, META",
        "content": "AI this, AI that.\n\nWe’ve heard it all from companies in their quarterly releases about the technology, with some seemingly shoving the term into their commentaries as a buzzword. But the obvious question remains – is anybody actually benefiting?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nSeveral companies, including Palantir PLTR and Meta Platforms META, are actually reaping the benefits of AI, as reflected by their quarterly results. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nPalantir Reports Record Profit\n\nPalantir’s quarterly release was filled with positivity, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue soared 27% year-over-year, whereas EPS climbed 200%. The company builds software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations.\n\nThe company’s platform continues to be highly attractive, reflected by 41% year-over-year customer growth. Impressively, PLTR closed over 27 deals worth $10 million throughout the period, further reflecting the snowballing demand. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThough strength was broad, the company’s US commercial sales were notably bright, growing 55% year-over-year alongside an 83% customer increase. The CEO delivered a notably bullish statement following the print, stating –\n\n‘In Q2 2024, we generated $159 million in revenue in the U.S. commercial market alone, an increase of 55% from the same period the year before. The growth rate was even more significant, at 70% year-over-year, when excluding strategic commercial contracts. And the persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no sign of relenting.’\n\nAnalysts have adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the robust release, with the now $2.8 billion expected suggesting a 21% jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, further reinforced by its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nMeta Platforms Delivers Stunning AI Statement\n\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The stock remains a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook reflecting bullishness across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, ‘We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\"\n\nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\n\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 21.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile companies continue to seemingly throw around the AI buzzword in their quarterly releases, several, including Palantir PLTR and Meta Platforms META, are actually benefitting from AI, with the trends expected to continue.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Strategist: Why Meta looks like the 'Magnificent 7' standout right now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks haven't had it easy lately, but investors shouldn't toss in the towel on them during a volatile August for markets.\n\nBe precise with the picks right now given more challenging market conditions, said Wind Shift Capital founder Bill Blain.\n\nBlain — the longtime author of the Morning Porridge newsletter — tagged Meta (META) as the best Magnificent Seven play today.\n\n“The business of advertising is massive,” Blain told Yahoo Finance executive Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). “About 75% of advertising goes through the internet, and the firm that controls that best at the moment is [Meta].”\n\nMeta's second quarter earnings last week underscore Blain's bullish call.\n\nEarnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 73% from a year ago.\n\nIts app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) also walloped expectations with revenues of $38.72 billion. Sales for the app family rose about $7 billion year over year.\n\nMeta stock has rallied 7.5% since the company's Aug. 1 earnings report, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares are still off by 4% in the past month as sentiment has soured on the Magnificent Seven name.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven includes Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta.\n\nUnlike Meta, the other six names have dealt with various negative news in recent weeks that have pressured their shares.\n\nNvidia is reportedly delaying the shipment of its new Blackwell AI chips by a quarter. Tesla had a terrible second quarter. Alphabet preached of needing more time for AI adoption, while market leader Microsoft's AI results didn't live up to expectations. Amazon warned of a slowing consumer in its second quarter.\n\nAll of the non-Meta Magnificent Seven stocks are down since Meta's earnings report, led by a 13% drop in Tesla stock.\n\nThen there is Apple.\n\nBlain, who had been bullish on Apple, has recently shifted perspective.\n\n“When Warren Buffett turned around and dumped the stock, I thought, he must know something I don’t,” said Blain.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) reportedly slashed its stake in the tech giant by as much as 50%. It's unclear as to Buffett's motivation, but it sent a negative signal to an increasingly jittery market.

        "title": "The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Now: August 2024",
        "content": "You don’t have to buy real estate to generate cash flow from your assets. Not only is it easier to buy the best dividend stocks with any amount of capital, but it also takes less work to stay on top of these investments.\n\nDividend-paying corporations often distribute dividends each quarter and raise their dividends each year. Some companies have kept their dividend programs intact for decades, while others have only been paying dividends for a few years. Most dividend investors reinvest their dividends unless they use cash flow to cover living expenses. Reinvestments increase the total number of shares an investor owns, which, in turn, increases the total dividend payouts.\n\nThere’s some concern that dividend stocks underperform the stock market, especially the companies with high yields. However, it’s possible to find the best dividend stocks that can outperform the stock market while distributing some of their retained earnings to investors. Wondering which dividends may be worth a closer look? These are some of the best dividend stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has been offering affordable prices for a wide range of products for more than 60 years. The company has also raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years, and that includes a 9% dividend hike this year. The stock isn’t only good for its 1.2% yield. Shares are up by 29% year-to-date and have rallied by 91% over the past five years, outperforming the S&P 500 in the process.\n\nQ1 FY25 earnings results suggest that more gains may be on the way for long-term investors. Consolidated revenue was up by 6% from a year ago and reached $161.5 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share increased by 22%.\n\nWalmart has a vast competitive moat that makes it difficult for new entrants to take any meaningful amount of market share. The retailer is the world’s leading grocer. Many people go to Walmart to buy food, and chances are they’ll pick up a few other items on their way out of their local store. Walmart currently owns more than 10,500 stores in 19 countries.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is an undervalued credit and debit card firm that has outperformed the S&P 500. Shares are up by 23% year-to-date and soared by 83% over the past five years. The stock trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 17x while offering a 1.2% yield. American Express has developed a good habit of maintaining a double-digit dividend growth rate for many years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s second-quarter earnings results suggest that double-digit dividend hikes will remain the norm. American Express reported 9% revenue growth from a year ago and 39% net income growth, resulting in a 20% net profit margin. The rising net income makes the P/E ratio particularly attractive. It’s difficult to find companies with AXP’s valuation and financial growth numbers.\n\nAmerican Express had 3.3 million new card acquisitions in the quarter.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) serves more than 1 million businesses in North America. The firm offers business supplies and safety equipment that translate into steady revenue. The stock has only a 0.8% yield but has delivered an annual double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Furthermore, the stock has regularly outperformed the market. Shares are up by 27% year-to-date and have rallied 185% over the past five years.\n\nThe company ended fiscal 2024 on a high note with 8.2% revenue growth. Cintas also delivered $414.3 million in net income, a 19.7% improvement from last year. Cintas delivered 8.9% revenue growth through fiscal 2024. Revenue in fiscal 2025 should range from $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion. The high end of guidance implies 7.4% revenue growth, but it’s important to note that fiscal 2025 has two fewer workdays than fiscal 2024.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock. Cintas is rated as a “moderate buy” with a projected 4% upside from current levels.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a consumer staples stock that offers stability during volatile markets. Shares have outperformed the market with a 14% year-to-date gain but lag the market with a five-year gain of 45%. The company’s strength is its wide range of essential products and services. Procter & Gamble is the parent company of numerous brands in home care, baby care, fabric care, and other verticals.\n\nThe stock has a 2.4% yield and has raised its dividend for 68 consecutive years. It has also distributed dividends to investors for 134 consecutive years. Procter & Gamble raised its dividend by 7% earlier this year.\n\nThe company wrapped up fiscal 2024 with flat sales growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June. Diluted earnings per share were slightly down but ended higher in full-year fiscal 2024. Procter & Gamble is a recession-resistant dividend stock with a respectable yield and low volatility. The stock currently has a 0.5x beta compared to the stock market’s 1x beta.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is a real estate investment trust specializing in storing physical and digital assets for more than 240,000 businesses. The firm also has roughly 90% of Fortune 1,000 corporations as its customers. Iron Mountain has regularly outperformed the stock market while having a 2.7% yield. Shares are up by 55% year-to-date and have rallied by 249% over the past five years.\n\nThe REIT continues to gain market share. Total revenue increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2024, reaching $1.5 billion in the process. Iron Mountain’s year-to-date revenue is also up by 13% from a year ago, demonstrating consistency. Net income reached $35 million.\n\nIron Mountain’s well-diversified customer base makes it more resistant to economic downturns. Furthermore, the company offers a vital service for businesses with significant switching costs. Finding another company that will store thousands of physical documents is cumbersome. Not only does a corporation need to find a suitable replacement but those documents must then get transported to their new location.\n\nIron Mountain has good relations with many companies, and it puts the firm in a position to generate higher returns for shareholders.\n\nGarmin (GRMN) Garmin company logo on a storefront\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) recorded a 31% year-to-date gain and is up by 109% over the past five years. Shares trade at a P/E ratio of 23x and come with a 1.8% yield.\n\nGarmin has several business segments that have pushed revenue and net income higher. However, fitness presents the largest opportunity. Second-quarter fitness sales increased by 28% from a year ago to $428 million. The resounding success of Garmin’s fitness products resulted in 14% revenue growth from a year ago. Net income increased by 4% yearly, resulting in a 20% net profit margin.\n\nThe company felt good enough about Q2 results to raise full-year guidance. Garmin anticipates revenue to reach $5.95 billion in the quarter. It’s also expecting a pro forma EPS of $6.00 per share. Garmin is currently rated as a Hold among five Wall Street analysts with a projected 5% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $210 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 27%.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) A woman holds Apple iPhone X with Instagram application on the screen at cafe. Instagram is a photo-sharing app for smartphones. META stock, Instagram layoffs\n\nSource: wichayada suwanachun / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the newest member on this last, having only issued dividends since Q4 2023. However, it’s not a newcomer to beating the stock market. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and have rallied by 167% over the past five years. The stock trades at a P/E ratio of 26x and offers a 0.4% yield.\n\nFacebook’s parent company can support an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for many years. Meta Platforms closed out the quarter with $58.08 billion in cash. Furthermore, net income jumped by 73% from a year ago. As profit margins continue to expand, it’s evident that the social media giant isn’t slowing down. Revenue increased by 22% to reach $39.1 billion in the quarter.\n\nInvestments in artificial intelligence can help the company diversify beyond ad revenue. However, the underlying business model is still growing. Meta Platforms announced that 3.27 billion people use its social networks every day. That’s a 7% yearly improvement.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks with Promising Applications",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence made headlines in 2024, with stocks in the space appreciating tremendously. Amid the growing adoption of technology, many companies are shelling out billions to advance their AI capabilities.\n\nAccording to a recent report by CompTIA, 22% of companies aim to pursue AI integration across their products. The report also found that 33% of companies are working with some type of AI application to improve their service and product delivery.\n\nBy riding this wave, investors can be sure to see gains over the medium term. Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy, which means these stocks hold great potential. Numerous technology applications are still being explored.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor instance, it could have use cases in defense, chatbots and data analysis. Consider these three companies if you want to invest in solid artificial intelligence stocks with great promise in returns. Let’s examine why these three stocks stand out.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) started as a graphics card company. However, its chips quickly became popular in the artificial intelligence sector. Since then, the company has been working to produce faster and more efficient chips for the industry.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has played an important role in this transformation, making Nvidia the go-to company for the best artificial intelligence chips.\n\nThus far, Huang’s efforts have paid off and Nvidia has been the top artificial intelligence stock of 2024. Despite sliding by double digits in the past few weeks, NVDA is still up 116.42% year. Over the past 12 months, the stock has gained 129.52%.\n\nLooking at the EPS, Nvidia has continued to maintain phenomenal growth. In the last quarterly results, it reported an EPS of $5.98, a 629% year-over-year increase.\n\nIts current trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 59.59 is relatively high. However, this high valuation is justifiable if it continues to maintain earnings growth.\n\nAdditionally, the company has a robust buyback program and pays out dividends. In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, it announced it had increased payouts by 150% to 10 cents per share.\n\nOver the past five years, NVDA has been one of the best-performing stocks, rising over 2500%.\n\nThe great stock performance, increased dividend payouts and the rising adoption of AI make Nvidia one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to own in August 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET)\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a leading software provider in the cloud computing and data center industries. The rise of artificial intelligence has been a huge boost for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll artificial intelligence models require massive amounts of data, which is where Arista comes in. It is helping to create networks that can adapt to the changing needs of large language models and other artificial intelligence use cases.\n\nIts stock performance has been quite robust. Year-to-date, it has gained 39.72% to $323.54 per share. In the past 12 months, its stock price has gained over 80%. If you had invested in ANET five years ago, you would have seen returns of almost 500% so far.\n\nIts trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 42.69 is quite high. However, the stock has also maintained robust earnings growth. Its diluted earnings per share have steadily been on the rise since 2020. As a result, its elevated valuation is justifiable.\n\nLooking at its financial results, Arista saw revenue rise 15.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to $1.69 billion. It also reported a GAAP net income of $665.4 million compared to $491.9 million the previous year.\n\nBased on its robust financial and stock performance, ANET is one of the main artificial intelligence stocks that should be in your portfolio in August 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a giant tech company best known for its social media platforms, Instagram and Facebook. The company is also one of the leading investors in artificial intelligence.\n\nOne of its well-known products to date is Llama 3.1, an open-source artificial intelligence model. In its second quarter fiscal 2024 results, Meta revealed it plans to spend up to $40 billion on research, with a good chunk of that going to artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite the huge capital expenditure, Meta reported astronomical profits with net income of $13.47 billion compared to $7.79 billion the previous year.\n\nInvestors have reacted positively to this increased spending with META up 42.68% this year and its value rising by 56% over the last 12 months.\n\nBased on its robust financial results and rising expenditures on artificial intelligence, Meta could be the go-to investment for artificial intelligence stocks. It shows great promise and has the financial capacity to develop technology to the next level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Wells Fargo analysts are urging investors to be selective in their equity investments, advising them to \"buy stocks, not the stock market.\"\n\nThis guidance comes as the S&P 500 (SPX) faces a slight downturn, with the index down 0.5% for the week but still up 12% year-to-date. Despite a 3% selloff on Monday, market sentiment improved as decent jobless claims data helped counter fears of a hard-landing recession.\n\nThe Wells Fargo analysts remain cautious about the broader market, citing \"traditional pre-Fed trends\" and the lack of immediate catalysts as reasons for their tempered outlook.\n\nThey maintain a year-end SPX target of 5535, implying a modest 4% upside from current levels. However, they are not advising a broad-based dip-buying strategy at this time, due to this week's events and ongoing uncertainties.\n\nInstead, Wells Fargo sees specific opportunities, particularly in the Communication Services sector, which has experienced a 9% pullback.\n\nThey highlight stocks like Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as attractive picks that appear on their momentum screens.\n\nThe analysts also note that momentum stocks have had a rough July but are starting to rebound. They expect \"Quants, Growth, and opportunistic PMs\" to begin adding to names with positive price momentum that are currently \"on sale.\"\n\nFinally, Wells Fargo points out the underperformance of the Russell 2000 index, calling it \"one of the best short sellers.\" They observe that many small-cap \"meme stocks\" have seen significant declines after their initial surge, a trend consistent with past reconstitutions of the index.meta\n\nRelated Articles\n\n'Buy stocks, not the stock market': Wells Fargo\n\nThe key question answered: If the time is now, what should I buy?\n\nExclusive-India's Mahindra seeks nod for $3 billion Shaanxi JV, sources say\n\nView comments",

It’s filled with tech stocks, but it has significant exposure to the Magnificent Seven. That’s no surprise, as these stocks also make up a large portion of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nTech has historically been a good sector for outperforming the stock market. However, you can also look at tech stocks to discover opportunities to outperform the tech industry. The tech sector has a few outliers that look ready for massive rallies. Investors can find these types of stocks by looking for companies that post rising revenue and net income.\n\nThe three tech stocks in this list have the potential to generate long-term returns.

Revenue soared by 22% YOY to reach $39.1 billion. Meanwhile, net income jumped by 73% YOY to $13.5 billion. The company’s headcount is only down by 1% YOY, so there’s more to Meta Platforms’ surging profits than firing employees. The company is also sitting on $58.08 billion in cash. It distributed $1.27 billion to investors as dividends and poured $6.32 billion into its stock buyback program.\n\nMeta Platforms stock has outperformed the market for several years.

AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading AI chipmaker that’s gaining momentum. The company generated a record $3.1 billion from its AI products and services, but that wasn’t the only good news in Q2 FY24 results. Revenue leaped by 43% YOY as the VMware acquisition continues to strengthen Broadcom’s infrastructure software business. More businesses are incorporating VMware into their software stacks to build private clouds.\n\nLeadership felt confident to raise guidance for fiscal 2024. Broadcom is now expected to generate $51 billion in consolidated revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be 61% of total revenue. Broadcom’s 10-for-1 stock split brought more attention to the stock, but it has been a consistent outperformer. Shares are up by 31% year-to-date and have soared by more than 400% over the past five years.\n\nA potential OpenAI partnership can open the door to more gains. It can pave the way for Broadcom to expand its market share in the AI chip industry.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NOW and AVGO.

        "title": "7 Undervalued Stocks With 500% Upside Potential After Coming Rate Cuts",
        "content": "The stock market has been a tale of two worlds in the post-pandemic era. On one side, you have many stocks that languished and traded sideways for what feels like an eternity. On the other, are the high-flyers that soared to dizzying heights, perhaps too high for their own good.\n\nWell, now the chickens are coming home to roost. We’re at the start of what could be a nasty correction and I wouldn’t be surprised if it turns into something more serious. All the classic recession indicators are flashing red.\n\nThe Sahm Rule, which has reliably signaled every recession in recent history, is screaming that trouble is on the horizon. Unemployment numbers are ticking up again after a period of strength. The yield curve, which was inverted for a while, is starting to normalize. Not to mention, the Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates as soon as September. Sound familiar? We’ve seen this movie before, and it usually doesn’t have a happy ending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, resets like these are ultimately healthy for the market. Sure, it’s painful in the short term but many solid companies could emerge from this downturn stronger than ever. That is especially true if interest rates revert to the near-zero levels of yesteryear. Here are seven undervalued stocks to look into if you think that could happen:\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Image of the PayPal logo on a smartphone next to a physical bitcoin token.\n\nSource: Primakov/shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal online payments platform PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has wallowed at discounted prices of around $60 for quite some time, even as the underlying business grows. Management tried to reignite interest by doing huge buybacks last year and announced another one this year without success.\n\nThe main concern is PayPal’s active accounts count, which declined after the pandemic boom. However, I believe this churn is reasonable as the economy normalized and some users temporarily moved back to cards and cash. Now four years after Covid and the churn is subsiding. sequential account growth turning positive again.\n\nWall Street appears to be weighing the issue of active accounts too heavily, considering that PayPal has proven it can squeeze lots of money from existing users.\n\nWith revenue up 9% and EPS jumping 36% in Q2, the valuation gap between the stock and business is widening. The massively lower earnings multiple is going to give PYPL stock an edge as investors go risk-off and start looking at the bottom line more. Undervalued stocks: PYPL EPS Revenue chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts at BTIG just reiterated their Buy rating with a $85 target, seeing “multiple tailwinds.” I believe there is a bigger chance of a huge upside breakout in the coming quarters, potentially sparked by interest rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the low downside risk at these prices, I’d happily wait it out. It’s one of the most undervalued stocks, in my opinion.\n\nCarnival (CCL, CUK) Carnival (CCL) logo sign in the night at their headquarters in Miami, Florida, USA. Carnival Cruise Line is an international cruise line.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarnival (NYSE:CCL, CUK) operates the world’s largest cruise line, capturing nearly 43% of global passenger traffic. The company has faced challenges in recent years, with shares underperforming the broader market considerably. However, Carnival is thriving financially as the pandemic’s impact fades. It reported record second-quarter revenues of $5.8 billion and bookings for 2025 enhancing revenue prospects.\n\nUnfortunately, Carnival was one of the businesses hit hardest during COVID. The ripple effects still haunt them due to the huge amount of debt they were forced to take on in 2020, followed by steep rate hikes a year later. The company is now spending a significant portion of its operating profits on debt servicing costs. CCL Income Statement\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, I believe this situation is unlikely to persist. A September rate cut looks very likely due to struggling tech stocks and the market is overwhelmingly pricing in such a move. These rate cuts would provide huge relief to Carnival. I think the resulting increase in profits once the Fed is done could pull the stock price back up to pre-COVID levels.\n\nDespite the challenges, analysts remain bullish on CCL. JPMorgan recently raised Carnival’s price target to $25, implying a 58.6% upside, citing strong demand and no slowdown in cruise indicators. With debt already reduced by $1.2 billion over six months and minimal maturities this year, I believe Carnival is well-positioned to capitalize on the rebounding travel industry. It could potentially deliver significant upside for investors willing to weather some near-term turbulence.\n\nJetBlue Airways (JBLU) jetblue (JBLU) airplane on a runway\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nJetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) operates as a low-cost airline in the U.S. The company has been navigating a challenging environment. Its stock price down 74% from its February 2020 peak as it deals with the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. I think it is among the most undervalued stocks in the airline industry.\n\nJetBlue finds itself in a situation similar to Carnival. Both companies are still grappling with the ripple effects of the pandemic. However, potential rate cuts on the horizon could provide a much-needed boost. If we see oil prices decline due to the economic downturn and passenger traffic remains at manageable levels, JetBlue could be poised for a sharp recovery in the coming years. The fleet has continued to grow despite the volatility, though. JetBlue total aircraft in service chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nDespite the challenges, there are reasons for optimism. In its Q2 2024 earnings call, JetBlue reported beating analysts’ expectations, with earnings per share of 8 cents surpassing the consensus estimate by 18 cents. The company also generated $34 million in adjusted pre-tax income for the quarter. Management has implemented a strategy called “JetForward” to address the competitive landscape and drive the airline back to profitability.\n\nWhile some analysts remain cautious, with UBS Group initiating coverage with a “Sell” rating and a $5.00 price target, others see potential. Deutsche Bank upgraded JetBlue to a “Buy” rating in February 2024, with a price target of $9.00.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), the company behind the popular social media app Snapchat, has been a disappointment among social media stocks lately. I’d only blame management for that. While most other social media companies have recovered massively and taken advantage of the rise in advertising spending, Snap’s financials and stock price have languished.\n\nI was pounding the table on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) back during their troughs in 2022. I really thought Snap’s management would be able to take similar steps to increase their profitability by cutting costs and boosting monetization. Unfortunately, that hasn’t materialized. Snap’s average revenue per user (ARPU) is still stuck in neutral, with most of its growth coming from its core base of young users continuing to expand.\n\nIf management can figure out how to meaningfully increase ARPU, it could supercharge Snap’s already strong user growth. The Q2 2024 earnings report showed some bright spots, with revenue up 16% year-over-year to $1.24 billion and daily active users increasing 9% to 432 million. Sadly, even that top-line growth missed estimates.\n\nAnd growth isn’t everything. Snap has yet to break even on a GAAP basis. I think it can easily do that with the cash it has on hand and it is already “profitable” on a non-GAAP basis. Snap cash EBIT revenue chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nDespite the challenges, I remain bullish on these bargain-basement stock prices. If Snap makes smart moves toward profitability, I wouldn’t be shocked to see multibagger returns in the coming years. A social media darling this popular with a coveted young demographic shouldn’t be struggling like this. But for now, you’ll need some patience and intestinal fortitude to bet on this turnaround.\n\nLasertec (LSRCY) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJapanese stocks have been on quite the rollercoaster ride in recent days. Japan had its worst day since 1987 but stocks have rebounded somewhat. Investors are talking about the Yen carry trade effect, which could have a huge impact on stocks worldwide as investors have borrowed massive amounts of money from Japanese banks and poured them into foreign markets. However, as Japan’s Yen climbs back up and the country raises rates, this is putting them deep in the red, especially as foreign markets have all started correcting.\n\nNow, Lasertec (OTCMKTS:LSRCY) hasn’t been a big victim of this yet, but the stock has corrected by around 45% from this year’s peak. It has returned to its more historical trough prices and I think it is a good place to buy the stock. The semiconductor industry is still going strong due to the high demand for data center chips. Even if those chips start seeing a fall in demand, Lasertec can benefit through automotive chip demand being stimulated in a lower interest rate environment in the U.S.\n\nLasertec recently reported record first-half sales and profits for fiscal year 2024. However, the company’s full-year forecast missed analyst estimates despite a strong Q4 performance.\n\nIn my view, Lasertec is an indirect bet on the chip industry. I think the current undervaluation could be worth buying into if you believe the stock has bottomed out. LSRCY stock has found solid support at $30 many times before so I believe something similar could be happening here.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile most companies outside of China have seen significant e-commerce growth, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and its peers have experienced low single-digit growth rates. I see JD as one of the most undervalued stocks in the Chinese market right now. Once we go through the current economic reset, China’s economy could rebound, and JD.com is well-positioned to benefit from this recovery. China has historically weathered global recessions well, so if the stars align, JD.com could deliver strong performance.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that trading restrictions and tariffs may pose challenges for JD.com in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, I think the company can still thrive within China if the economy improves there. The Chinese market alone should provide ample opportunity for JD.com to grow and stage a comeback. What sets JD.com apart from other e-commerce players in China is its focus on quality products rather than cheap goods sold in bulk.\n\nIn Q1 2024, JD.com reported net revenues of 260 billion renminbi ($36 billion), a 7% increase year-over-year. The company also saw improvements in profitability, with operating income rising 19.8% and net income growing 13.9%.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Person holding smartphone with logo of startup and aerospace company Joby Aviation (air taxi) on screen JOBY stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is an electric air taxi company that aims to revolutionize urban transportation. The company has been making steady progress toward its goal of launching commercial operations in 2025, but it’s still a pre-revenue startup facing significant challenges.\n\nJoby formally applied for aircraft certification in Australia, seeking to validate its expected FAA-type certification there to expand globally. The company also completed an impressive 523-mile trip in a hydrogen-electric aircraft in July.\n\nAnalysts estimate it could generate $4.4 billion in revenue in 2030, but those projections are highly speculative. In Q1 2024, Joby reported a net loss of $95 million on just $25,000 in revenue from a government contract. It has the cash to handle these losses, but it’s hard to say if it can continue doing so until it turns profitable. Joby Aviation cash debt chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPersonally, I see Joby as the riskiest bet discussed in this article. If you’re swinging for a 500% home run and willing to stomach the volatility, a small speculative position could make sense. But for most investors, I’d watch Joby’s progress from the sidelines for now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Qualcomm's Fortunes Seem To Be Turning Around\n\nLast Wednesday, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings, surpassing Wall Street estimates, while also issuing a strong guidance for the current quarter. However, while both top and bottom line slightly surpassed estimates, this wasn’t enough to make the market excited.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 23rd, Qualcomm reported adjusted revenue of $9.39 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $9.22 billion. Revenue grew 11% YoY.\n\nThe chip business or more precisely, three hardware lines reported together as QCT reported sales grew 12% YoY as they brought in revenue of $8.1 billion.\n\nIts handsets business grew 12% YoY to $5.9 billion, suggesting recovery after a deep two-year slump in smartphone sales. When it comes to the smartphone market, summer months are usually a slower bit of the annual cycle.\n\nInternet of Things business that includes selling chips for lower-cost devices and Quest headsets from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) revenue contracted 8% YoY to $1.4 billion, but still surpassed StreetAccount’s estimate of $641.7 million. Back in 2022, Meta and Qualcomm partnered to deliver multi-generation metaverse experiences. While the agreement Qualcomm made with Meta is a broad multi-year strategic collaboration, but two years later, the metaverse still didn’t come to life. Although Meta and Mark Zuckerberg are not giving up on the metaverse, they have been talking more about generative AI.\n\nLicensing revenue from collecting fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products grew 3% to $1.3 billion.\n\nAutomotive revenues grew 87% YoY to $811 million, topping StreetAccount’s consensus estimate of $641.7 million. Although automotive chips remains a small part of Qualcomm’s total revenue stream, but it is seen as one of its biggest future growth opportunities and diversification.\n\nEarnings grew 18% YoY as net income amounted to $2.13 billion or $1.88 per share. Adjusted earnings surged 25% YoY to $2.33 per share.\n\nCurrent Quarter Guidance Indicates Improvement Is On The Horizon\n\nQualcomm guided for sales in the range between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion, forecasting earnings per share between $2.38 and $2.58. Looking at midpoint figures, this guidance indicates a 14% revenue improvement from the previous quarter, along with 26% improvement for the bottom line. However, CEO Cristiano Amon did hint that the smart phone market recovery won’t be fast, pointing out kind of flattish to low single digits in growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm’s fortunes seems to be turning around.\n\nWhile the smartphone market slump has brought down Qualcomm’s financials over the past three years, its latest results suggest growth seems to be back on track. In addition, growth of the AI-enabled smartphone market should support the company in sustaining its newly found growth momentum.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Remember that time the metaverse was a big deal and would change the way we worked, played and interacted with one another? Yeah, good times.\n\nUnfortunately for companies that went all-in on the idea, living your life totally connected to the online world hasn’t gone according to plan. While the virtual hellscape is not dead, it does give off a death rattle.\n\nMost people did not even know what the metaverse was until Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Despite its misnamed alternate reality division Reality Labs losing $50 billion since 2020, the social media giant continues to throw billions more into the sinkhole. Investors were worried it was going to repeat the mistake when it noticeably shifted its attention to artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile AI has sucked all the oxygen out of the room so that hardly anyone even discusses the metaverse anymore, there are still companies tied to it. And because the world has seemingly moved beyond this virtual world, investors should be wary of the three metaverse stocks to sell below.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree years ago, Unity Software (NYSE: U) was going to power the metaverse. It even acquired Metaverse Technologies for $45 million because of its ability to enhance 3D computer-aided design visualization performance.\n\nBecause the Unity Engine is a leader in virtual and augmented reality, not to mention gaming, it was responsible for powering most of the world’s mobile games. Yet as the gaming market cooled off and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) changed its privacy policies that impacted Unity’s advertising business, U stock went into a deep freeze, too.\n\nUnity Software lost 86% of its value over the last three years and over 92% from its late-2021 peak. Although the company is still an important component of the gaming market as well as in the VR and AR worlds, the metaverse is doing nothing to help.\n\nThe software specialist is losing ground to Epic Games Unreal Engine, it is downsizing its business still and there are few prospects for turning a profit anytime soon. For all the promise Unity Software held with driving the metaverse forward, it is now a prime metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline gaming platform Roblox (NASDAQ: RBLX) has fared only a little better than Unity Software, losing 72% of its value from the height of its 2021 valuation. Shares are down 16% so far this year, though they had been much lower.\n\nIts immersive gaming platform remains entwined with the metaverse, which is what is holding it back. Because there is little development in education, industrial usage, or services, in the metaverse there seems no catalyst to fire up growth. While it can attract users to its gaming platform, as noted previously that market has largely stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond-quarter daily average users rose 21% to 79.5 million and monthly unique payers rose 22% to 16.5 million. So the site is still able to attract players. But bookings, which refers to sales of Roblox’s virtual currency, rose less than revenue. That indicates overall slower growth is coming in the future.\n\nRoblox also still generates losses. They only improved slightly to $205.8 million from $282.7 million last year. The gaming platform still has a tough slog ahead of it and it trades at a premium valuation, making it a metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Illustration of the metaverse. A young boy wearing a VR headset is in the metaverse.\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTypically buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a way to spread out risk while capturing all of a sector’s growth potential. In the case of Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA: METV), it was a way to absorb all the risk of the metaverse, as it is proving to be more fad than trend.\n\nThe ETF’s stock is down 20% in 2024 and it sits almost 30% below its all-time high. With Roblox being its top holding, representing over 9% of the portfolio, and Unity Software a top-10 pick, the only reason it is not faring worse is because it also owns a handful of Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple, Meta and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) account for over 18% of its holdings. Yet other than Meta, the other two are only tangentially related to the metaverse.\n\nA look at its holdings also shows why you can’t just go by an ETF’s name before you buy. It owns a collection of top chipmakers, cloud stocks and gaming companies. There are actually very few metaverse stocks in the portfolio.\n\nEven so, Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has vastly underperformed the S&P 500. While it sports a reasonable 0.59% expense ratio, its inability to capitalize on the tech industry’s growth while avoiding the pitfalls of its true metaverse stocks makes it an ETF to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As we approach November 5 and U.S. presidential election, social media stocks are on everyone’s mind.\n\nSocial media stocks are becoming more relevant in debates and conjecture on the next election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAdditionally, well-known social media stocks are attracting attention from internet expansion, corporate collaboration, and video demand. Forecasting a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from $81.42 billion in 2024, global social media is expected to reach $179.22 billion by 2029.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe U.S. and Canada help to explain why the North American social media market is among the biggest. It’s estimated to propel 40% of the worldwide social media market expansion between 2023 and 2027.\n\nMass populations in China, India, and Indonesia help Asia-Pacific become the fastest-growing social media market. WeChat and TikHub are leading the market expansion in this vast industry.\n\nThe 2024 elections could increase social media political ad spending. With U.S. social media political advertising expected to surpass $2 billion, eMarketer indicates its growing importance in reaching voters.\n\nLet’s look at three buy-rated social media firms with double-digit upsides, likely to get a boost from the secular growth and political events impacting the industry.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough the software behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is praised for switching from desktop to cloud computing and AI, its brand is also very prominent among social media stocks.\n\nNew tools and improvements at Microsoft Build 2024 let app creators use AI. Azure upgrades, GitHub Copilot extensions, and Copilot Studio facilitate the development of AI assistants. These technologies support digital ecosystem-integrated applications and ease development by means of social media.\n\nConcurrently, nearly 141 million LinkedIn members log in daily—16.2% of 875 million total. With an average user duration of eight minutes, LinkedIn has 1.7 billion daily views.\n\nA business-to-business powerhouse, 97% of marketers utilize LinkedIn for content marketing. Lead generation relies mostly on social media, as 80% of B2B contacts start from it.\n\nMicrosoft has also improved its advertising tool, including AI-powered asset recommendations for video ads and more general LinkedIn targeting of different sectors.\n\nMSFT is a “strong buy” on 32 analyst evaluations. Given the tremendous demand for MSFT’s AI technologies, the stock’s 12-month upside, which averages $503.19, is not difficult to reach.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms‘ (NASDAQ:META) second-quarter 2024 sales rose 22.1% to $39.1 billion. Earnings per share increased 73% to $5.16 from the same time last year. Meta’s collection of applications has 3.3 billion daily active users, up 7%. Meta’s impressive result beat analysts’ $38.3 billion sales and $4.73 EPS projections. The upside for META stock is a potential 11%.\n\nBesides, Meta continues to spend substantially on AI. According to estimates, Meta AI will become widely used worldwide by the end of the year. Meta developed Segment Anything Model 2, which can find target components in images and movies, and AI Studio, a tool for building original AI chatbots without technological knowledge. Furthermore, Meta’s open-source AI models encourage creativity.\n\nMeta also uses cutting-edge AI to enhance ad targeting and user experience, enabling revenue opportunities in numerous areas, including tailored ad design and brand message.\n\nFinally, up from $35 billion to $40 billion, Meta’s 2024 capital expenditure plan now runs $37 billion to $40 billion. Significant AI research and commercialization have produced these advances. As Meta develops its AI and technology, Susan Li, its chief financial officer, foresees a significant increase in capital expenditures through 2025, helping enhance Meta’s products.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) offers new algorithms to enhance old ones. A portion of the home feed now includes video pins. Content authors rearrange their pins for new reach pins.\n\nCreative Studio, launched by Pinterest, lets firms generate lifestyle photos for their goods. With this option, companies may add their Pin link, pick questions, and obtain unique background photographs.\n\nPinterest is becoming more shoppable by using mobile deep links and direct connections to guide visitors from discovery to purchase.\n\nAdditionally, Pinterest integrated Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Commerce Cloud and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Commerce native apps. These partnerships simplify Pinterest eCommerce by letting merchants manage their product catalogs in these applications.\n\nEngaging users and strong monetization helped Pinterest grow 21% to $854 million in Q2 2024. The company has 522 million platform monthly active users worldwide, up 12% year over year. Pinterest earned 29 cents per share, above analysts’ 28-cent forecast.\n\nNext year, Pinterest’s earnings will rise 61% to 71 cents per share, according to estimates; the stock’s upside is also 61%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Kevin O'Leary Says California Is A Dumpster Fire For Business. Is He Right?",
        "content": "Kevin O'Leary Says California Is A Dumpster Fire For Business. Is He Right?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe recent news that Chevron is leaving San Ramon, CA, for Houston, TX, is another example of what has been termed the California exodus. Many businesses have left the Golden State over the last several years.\n\nSpeaking with Fox Business, Shark Tank entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary explained what he thinks is happening. He noted that much of the shift has happened since 2019 when Gavin Newsom took office as California's governor. O'Leary called Newsom a great guy but someone who has \"no executional skills and no idea what is going on here.\" He accused Newsom of turning his state into a version of Venezuela with broken policies.\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nO'Leary pointed out that he has many food businesses but doesn’t touch California because of its minimum wage. California raised the minimum wage from $16 to $20 in April, which has impacted major food service businesses. Some companies, including Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), have raised their prices to compensate for the higher business costs. That can be a risky game in this economy with a price-sensitive consumer.\n\nIs It Just Business Policies?\n\nO'Leary called California a dumpster fire, saying that energy is the lifeblood of the economy and that losing a significant energy business like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) would be a big blow to the state. While he blamed Newsom, the problem may have been going on longer than his tenure as governor. The California Policy Institute found that over 237 businesses have left the state since 2005, and that doesn’t include some of the most recent announcements. On that list were 11 Fortune 1000 companies. Other factors beyond business policies may be influencing these moves. One of them is the high cost of living and the other is the cost of real estate, which makes it hard for many employees to afford a home. The Public Policy Institute of California found that California has higher rates of cost-burdened households than the U.S. as a whole, prompting some people to consider moving.\n\nOverwhelmingly, companies are moving to Texas. Of the 237 companies mentioned above, 120 moved to Texas, and the state has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state. Commercial Property Executive rounded up the most popular areas for relocation, and the Dallas and Austin areas were the runaway winners. Florida was also on the list, with Orlando and Miami as destination cities. Both states are known for having no income tax and business-friendly policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500. Discover the potential of this market before other investors. Don’t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nIt's not just California that O'Leary says is bad for business. He mentioned that he recently optioned land for a data center in West Virginia, which is something he would never do in upstate New York because \"you can't get anything done in New York.\"\n\nO'Leary suggested that a \"change in management\" was necessary to turn the tide for California, but the reasons are more complicated than just who sits in the governor's seat. Much of it has to do with the high cost of living in the state, especially in the coastal areas. Despite the companies moving away from the state, it is still home to many big technology companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META). It is the fifth-largest economy in the world, with a GDP of nearly $3.1 trillion in 2023 and a growth rate of 6.1%. In April, the governor's office reported that California is still tops in the U.S. for new business starts and access to venture capital. The state is seeing a migration, but California still has business opportunities.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "The 7 Best Growth Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "The stock market has its ebbs and flows, but the long-term results look good. The S&P 500 has achieved an annualized return of 10.16% over the past 20 years. While investors look at statistics like that to justify long-term investing, it’s important to remember this lesson during economic contractions.\n\nAlong the way to 10.16% annualized returns, the index has endured many corrections and a few crashes. The Great Recession and the pandemic flash crash quickly come to mind. While the index has delivered impressive long-term returns, some growth stocks have delivered better returns in recent years. Some investors have made a lot of money by looking beyond the index. In fact, you can find great growth stocks by looking within benchmarks.\n\nMany stocks within the S&P 500 have outperformed the index over the past few years. That’s by definition, since the S&P 500 has plenty of “dead money” stocks. Wondering which growth stocks look ready to deliver long-term returns? These are some of the promising opportunities to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the leading online advertiser that continues to deliver solid revenue growth. The company reported 14% YoY revenue growth in Q2 2024. Cloud revenue was a highlight, growing by 29% YoY and representing more than 10% of Alphabet’s total revenue. That part of Alphabet’s business should continue to accelerate thanks to artificial intelligence.\n\nMany people use Google and YouTube to find relevant information and for entertainment. Both search engines attract billions of monthly visitors. Net income jumped by 29% YoY, resulting in a 28% net profit margin.\n\nThe recent financial success comes as Alphabet stock trades at a bargain. It only has a 24.5x P/E ratio despite demonstrating double-digit revenue and net income growth rates. Alphabet stock also has a 0.48% yield and will likely maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have gained 182% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) completes the advertising duopoly with its 3.27 billion daily active users. That’s a 7% YoY increase in total users. Meta Platforms has been a fan favorite among Wall Street analysts who ave rated it as a ‘Strong Buy‘ with a projected 13% upside. It’s no wonder shares are up by 41% year-to-date and have soared by 158% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial growth continues to be a highlight for the company. Revenue increased by 22% YOY in the second quarter while net income jumped by 73% YOY. The end result was a 34.5% net profit margin. The company knows how to retain people’s attention on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s common to find people who spend hours of their time on the company’s social networks every day.\n\nMeta Platforms knows how to keep people on its social networks, and it’s been much to the delight of investors.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nHave you ever wanted to learn a new language? While it’s a multi-year commitment to learn most languages, Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) makes it easier to complete the journey. The educational app offers verbal and written exercises that help people master new languages.\n\nDuolingo enjoys several tailwinds and strong financials that aren’t apparent based on the stock’s 24% year-to-date decline. Some investors are nervous about OpenAI uprooting Duolingo’s business model, but those concerns are unfounded at the moment.\n\nWhile there’s plenty of chatter and uninspiring year-to-date returns, Duolingo’s financials are promising. The company reported 45% YoY revenue growth in the first quarter. That growth rate helped the company generate $167.6 million in sales. Net income came to $27.0 million compared to a $2.6 million net loss in the same quarter last year.\n\nMonthly active users grew by 35% YoY. The app should soon have 100 million monthly active users. Rising profit margins and strong demand for the app should result in long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) continues to innovate in the financial industry. Robinhood Gold offers a suite of perks, such as a credit card with unlimited 3% cashback, 3% IRA matches and 1% deposit boosts. Gold subscription revenue contributed to a 35% YoY improvement in the company’s “Other revenues” segment, and that wasn’t the most exciting thing about Q1 2024 results.\n\nOverall revenue increased by 40% YoY amid booming demand for transactions. Crypto transaction revenue saw a 232% YoY improvement while options revenue increased by 16% YoY. Transaction revenue from equities jumped by 44% YoY.  Robinhood generated an 18 cent diluted EPS in the quarter compared to a negative 57 cent diluted EPS in the same quarter last year.\n\nHigh growth rates and several financial products suggest that the company can continue to grow. More people are flocking to Robinhood, as the company added 1.1 million new investment accounts year-over-year. The fintech firm now has 24.4 million investment accounts.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) An image of a circle web with a lock icon in the center. AI stocks\n\nSource: vs148 / Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a booming cloud security company that has logged a 78% year-to-date gain. The stock has more than tripled over the past five years but remains relatively unknown. CommVault Systems only has a 35.5x P/E ratio and a $6 billion market cap.\n\nRevenue and net income growth both trended in the right direction in the latest quarter. Q1 FY25 revenue increased by 13% YoY while net income was up by 47% YoY. The company closed out the quarter with an 8.3% net profit margin.\n\nCommVault Systems has benefited from a recurring revenue model that continues to gain momentum. While overall revenue increased by 13% YoY, subscription revenue soared by 28% YOY in the quarter. Subscription revenue made up more than half of the company’s total revenue. Furthermore, the company generates $636 million in annual recurring revenue. This figure is up by 27% YoY. CommVault Systems even had enough cash available to initiate a $51.4 million stock buyback.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle Mexican fast food chain restaurant at night. CMG stock\n\nSource: Hrach Hovhannisyan / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has delivered long-term returns that have outpaced many tech stocks. The Mexican Grill chain’s shares are up by 17% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. Rising revenue and net income have become two norms for the company, and it continued those trends in the second quarter. Revenue increased by 18.2% YoY to reach $3.0 billion while net income came in at $456 million, marking a 33% YoY improvement.\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain continued its expansion by opening an additional 52 company-operated restaurants and one international licensed restaurant. Chipotle remains on target to open 285-315 restaurants this year.\n\nWhile new locations continued to overall revenue growth, the company’s 11.1% YoY improvement in comparable restaurant sales indicates that Chipotle is becoming a mainstay in many locations. The restaurant chain’s healthier food options have given it more pricing power compared to other fast food restaurants.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) can navigate various economic cycles. When people need to cut back on purchases, they can turn to Walmart. The company has been offering affordable products and services for more than 60 years. However, Walmart can also do well when the economic is strong. Investors only need to look at historical returns to test that theory. Shares are up by 29% year-to-date and have gained 88% over the past five yers.\n\nDespite those gains, Walmart still has a respectable 1.21% yield. Furthermore, the stock trades at a 29x P/E ratio. As net income continues to grow, the P/E ratio will look more attractive. Growth has become an expectation among Walmart investors, as the retailer generated 6.0% YoY revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nAdvertising and e-commerce sales were significant contributors. Those segments grew by 24% and 21% YoY respectively. Walmart’s overall business continues to grow, and that success translated into a $1.1 billion stock buyback during the quarter. Walmart still has a $9.4 billion cash position.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG and CVLT.

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club Within 3 Years",
        "content": "The U.S. economy has produced the world's most valuable companies for over a century. United States Steel became the first company to achieve a $1 billion valuation in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company to surpass a valuation of $1 trillion.\n\nApple was also the first company to cross the $2 trillion and $3 trillion thresholds. Only three other U.S. companies -- Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet -- are valued at more than $2 trillion as of this writing, but I think one more is set to join them.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp, but it's also becoming a serious contender in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Meta is using AI to improve monetization on its social platforms, but it also developed the world's most advanced open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama.\n\nHere's how Meta could achieve a $2 trillion valuation within three years, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today could earn a 67% return. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI is transforming Meta's core business\n\nMeta serves over 3.2 billion people across its family of apps every single day. Social networks like Facebook and Instagram used to focus on connecting users with their friends and family, but they have transformed into entertainment platforms with AI-powered recommendation engines ensuring everybody sees the most relevant content, even if it wasn't posted by someone they know.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg says this shift is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's platforms, which means they view more ads and, therefore, become more valuable to the company. Speaking of which, Meta continues to develop AI tools for advertisers, too, which can help them create the most engaging content and target the most relevant audience.\n\nEventually, Zuckerberg says businesses will be able to tell Meta their objective and their budget, and its AI engine will autonomously handle the entire process for them -- from crafting the creative to selecting the target audience. That's a game changer, because it means even the smallest business with no marketing team can yield the best possible return from its ad dollars.\n\nBut it gets better. Meta released a chatbot called Meta AI last year that can answer questions on most topics and even generate images on demand. It paves the way for Business AI, which could be a substantial revenue driver in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent trained to handle incoming queries from customers on Messenger and WhatsApp, for example, and even process sales. That will facilitate around-the-clock service even when the business owner is unavailable.\n\nStory continues\n\nLlama is the key to it all\n\nLlama is the LLM that powers the exciting AI features I just mentioned. It's open-source, because Zuckerberg believes a widely deployed model used by thousands of developers will improve at a much faster rate than if Meta did all of the testing and troubleshooting alone.\n\nMeta just released Llama 3.1, and with 405 billion parameters, it's the most advanced version so far. Zuckerberg says Llama 3 is already competitive with most leading models, but he's focused on developing Llama 4, which he believes will set the standard for the industry next year.\n\nTraining Llama 4 will require up to 10 times the data center compute capacity compared to Llama 3, which means it will likely cost tens of billions of dollars in new infrastructure. I'll talk more about the cost in a moment, but better LLMs will result in more advanced user-facing AI applications, so Meta will have to invest heavily if it wants to stay ahead of the pack.\n\nOtherwise, users might spend more time on OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini instead of Meta AI, which could hurt the company's ability to generate revenue.\n\nMeta's earnings continue to surge\n\nMeta generated $39 billion in revenue during Q2, which was a 22% increase from the year-ago period. But the company's bottom line is the real story, because it continues to benefit from the cost-cutting measures enacted since late 2022. They involved 21,000 job cuts and a commitment from Zuckerberg to spend more cautiously on projects like the metaverse, which generate minimal revenue.\n\nAs a result, Meta's Q2 net income soared 73% year over year to $13.4 billion. That followed three straight quarters of triple-digit percentage growth.\n\nThe result was especially impressive when you consider the speed with which Meta is ramping up its capital expenditures for AI. It allocated $8.4 billion toward capex during Q2, which was up from the $6.3 billion it spent during the first quarter.\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li told investors capex could hit $40 billion for the whole of 2024, so spending appears set to accelerate in the second half of the year. Plus, Li forecasts \"significant\" growth in capex in 2025.\n\nNearly all of that money will go toward data center infrastructure, servers, and chips to accelerate the development of LLMs like Llama 4, which will bring new user-facing AI applications to life.\n\nMeta's path to the $2 trillion club within three years\n\nBased on Meta's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $19.59 and its current stock price of around $488, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.9. That means it would have to rise 23% just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 30.6. That alone would lift Meta's market cap to almost $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut Meta is even cheaper when measured against its future earnings. Wall Street expects the company to generate $23.93 in earnings per share during 2025, placing the stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 20.4. If that forecast is accurate and Meta's P/E ratio also rises to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 by the end of next year, that will place its valuation at $1.8 trillion.\n\nThat implies Meta will only have to grow its earnings per share by 11% in 2026 to warrant a $2 trillion valuation. Considering the company grew its earnings at a compound annual rate of almost 30% in the decade between 2014 and 2023, I say there is a very good chance it delivers.\n\nPlus, there is a strong possibility that AI is a more powerful tailwind for Meta than analysts expect right now. The company's growing portfolio of AI tools -- especially for businesses -- could drive up marketing spending and also pull ad dollars away from its competitors. There is no telling how big that opportunity might become.\n\nEven if it doesn't get there within three years, I think Meta has a clear path to join the $2 trillion club eventually.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Utilities Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "Utility stocks are looking attractive after wandering in the wilderness for the past couple of years due to high inflation and interest rates.\n\nHigh prices caused pushback on utility rate increases, while the capital-intensive nature of their operations left them languishing in the high interest rate environment. It costs a lot of money to maintain, upgrade and build utility infrastructure, and the historically high rate environment significantly increased borrowing costs.\n\nBut with inflation somewhat muted compared to the 40-year highs it hit and the prospects for interest rate cuts growing, the best utilities stocks are primed for growth. Energy consumption by data centers is soaring, becoming an incredibly unique growth opportunity for the sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUtilities have long been seen as widow-and-orphan investments because of their stability and the reliability of their income payments. With the cost and demand environment shifting in the industry’s favor, these are the three best utilities stocks to buy now.\n\nEntergy (ETR) Entergy sign at their headquarters in New Orleans\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLocated in the southeast region of the U.S., Entergy (NYSE:ETR) is primed to benefit from the ongoing data center buildout trend underway. Because utility rates tend to be lower in this region than elsewhere in the country, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are constructing new facilities there. Meta is building a new $800 million data center campus in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nEntergy is also in the middle of a capital expenditure program. It is spending nearly $2 billion in Louisiana to upgrade its electric grid infrastructure to make it more resilient. In a bid to bolster its transmission lines and distribution system, the utility stock is eying some 2,100 separate projects to reinforce critical structures. And this is just the first phase of a multi-phase process to improve its systems. Two years ago it unveiled a $25 billion capital plan to cover all of its service areas.\n\nThe market already likes what it sees. Entergy stock is up 15% in 2024 and stands 20% higher over the past year. With a dividend yielding 3.8% annually, investors in the best utilities stocks like ETR will benefit handsomely down the road.\n\nDuke Energy (DUK) the duke energy logo\n\nSource: jadimages / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilarly situated is one of the largest regulated utilities in the country, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Although best known for its service in North Carolina, its largest market, Duke also has a substantial presence in Florida.\n\nDuke is installing 300 megawatts (MW) of solar annually. It plans to have as much as 1,500 MW of utility-owned solar in service in Florida by the end of the year. It further expects to more than triple the amount of solar power in operation by 2033. As noted, North Carolina is Duke’s most important market and it plans to install 1,500 MW of solar annually for the next 10 years beginning in 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs is apparent, Duke is working towards a net-zero carbon emissions footprint by 2050. Renewable energy is a critical component of its plan, and the utility is willing to spend up to $73 billion between 2024 and 2028 to help achieve it.\n\nDuke Energy is looking for its per-share profits to grow 5% to 7% annually through 2028. In the second quarter, it reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook of $5.85 to $6.10 per share. That implies 7% growth at the midpoint.\n\nConsolidated Edison (ED) Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.\n\nSource: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNew York-based Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is the third of the best utilities stocks to buy in August.\n\nProviding electricity, natural gas and steam to 10 million customers in New York state, ConEd, as the utility is known, is one of the largest publicly traded energy-delivery companies. Unlike Duke, though, ConEd has largely abandoned its renewable energy efforts. It sold off those assets last year for $6.8 billion. Instead, it is investing in offshore wind energy projects.\n\nConEd’s rate regulation has markedly improved. Its largest division, Cecony, operates under a revenue decoupling framework. That means its profits are disassociated from its electricity sales. Rather, it is given a rate of return in line with meeting revenue targets. Rates are also set for three years, giving the utility plenty of clarity into its growth potential.\n\nThe utility’s much smaller unit, Orange & Rockland, also has a revenue decoupling arrangement.\n\nConsolidated Edison’s stock is up 11% year-to-date. It also pays a dividend that yields 3.2% annually. ConEd has been in business for over 200 years and has paid a dividend for more than a century. It has increased the payout for 46 consecutive years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in ED stock.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best AI Monetization Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a “little bit of a reset, obviously.” The analyst said that AI stocks had a “great run” and the latest pullback is a “typical process” of market rotation.\n\n“It doesn’t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that’s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,” Landsberg said.\n\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said “absolutely not” and called the recent pullback “deceleration” from growth and “normalization.”\n\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will “separate the wheat from the chaff” and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\n\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Hypergrowth Company Will Be Wall Street's First $6 Trillion Stock -- and It's Not Nvidia!",
        "content": "Change is one of the only constants investors will find on Wall Street. Thanks to a combination of innovation, acquisitions, mergers, bankruptcies, legal judgments, competition, and even Acts of God, the stock market's \"leaderboard\" is constantly in flux. This is to say that Wall Street's largest companies today aren't liable to hold their positions five, 10, or even 20 years from now.\n\nJust six years ago, tech goliath Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made history by becoming the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market cap. By June 2023, it had crossed the psychological $3 trillion barrier. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt took less than five years for the stock market's largest company to triple in value, which begs the question: Which hypergrowth company will be the first to double the current peak of a little over $3 trillion in market cap and reach a $6 trillion valuation?\n\nWhile I'll give you my very clear prediction in a moment, let me work my way backwards and show why some of today's most-influential businesses within the \"Magnificent Seven\" aren't the answer.\n\nNvidia and Apple? No chance.\n\nConsidering that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest thing since sliced bread, you'd think AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would have the inside track to becoming Wall Street's most-valuable business. However, I've been pointing out for months just how many headwinds the ace of the AI movement is set to face.\n\nDespite having superior AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) with top-notch compute ability, Nvidia's inability to satisfy all of its customers will open the door for external competitors to grab market share.\n\nLikewise, all four of Nvidia's largest customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, they're going to take up valuable data center space and lessen the need for Nvidia's hardware in the years to come.\n\nThe biggest worry might just be that every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years has navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. With most businesses lacking a clear gameplan with their AI investments, it looks probable that the AI bubble will burst sooner than later, and ultimately drag Nvidia down with it.\n\nAs for Apple, its growth engine has mostly stalled out. Net sales are up by about 1% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). Although a record-breaking buyback program has been a major help to Apple's bottom line, it makes no sense for investors to pay a high multiple to earnings if Apple's sales growth is hardly above the flatline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile subscription services continue to be a bright spot -- up 13.2% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023 -- lagging iPhone sales are liable to drag on Apple's share price.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms? Possibly, but ample headwinds exist.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) do have a path to a $6 trillion valuation, but would need things to go just right for it to happen.\n\nMicrosoft enjoys sustainable moats and exorbitant cash flow from its legacy Windows and Office segments, and should deliver double-digit sales growth from Azure, the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. With plenty of cash on hand, Microsoft can easily invest for the future via organic or inorganic means.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is also heavily tied to the AI revolution via its investments in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT. If the AI bubble were to burst, as I expect it will, it could be hit harder than other \"Magnificent Seven\" members, aside from Nvidia.\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet should benefit nicely from the growth of its cloud infrastructure service platform known as Google Cloud. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early innings, which bodes well for this high-margin operating segment.\n\nThe only true knock I have against Alphabet is its strongly cyclical ties. With roughly 76% of its $84.7 billion in second-quarter sales derived from advertising, Alphabet will always be somewhat tethered to the health of the U.S. and global economy, as well as investor sentiment.\n\nComparatively, Meta Platforms is even more reliant on advertising. Just shy of 98% of its $75.5 billion in net sales through the first-half of 2024 have come from ads on its social media platforms.\n\nAlthough long-winded economic expansions are a positive for Meta's ad-driven operating model, and the company's metaverse investments have a chance to pay off in a big way in the latter-half of this decade, its stock would have to quintuple in value to become Wall Street's first $6 trillion company. This seems a stretch given the potential for U.S. economic growth to slow in the coming quarters. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $6 trillion stock is likely to be...\n\nThough it's going to take some time -- i.e., don't expect the stock market's outsized annual returns to continue indefinitely -- my prediction is that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will cut the proverbial ribbon and cross the $6 trillion threshold before any other publicly traded company.\n\nWhile most people have acquainted themselves with Amazon through its globally leading online marketplace, the nuts-and-bolts that generate the bulk of the company's operating cash flow have little to do with e-commerce.\n\nFirst and foremost, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. AWS held a 31% share of cloud infrastructure services spending as of the end of 2023, with annual run-rate sales topping $105 billion, as of June 30. This segment is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, and it should play a key role in doubling Amazon's operating cash flow by 2026.\n\nAmazon is also just beginning to harness the value of its content via its Prime subscription service. Landing an 11-year streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), coupled with being the exclusive partner of Thursday Night Football, makes Amazon's video platform the wave of the future. It should have no trouble increasing Prime subscription prices, as well as generating boatloads of advertising revenue.\n\nSpeaking of advertising services, Amazon is seeing north of 3 billion visits to its website on a monthly basis. Since many visitors to Amazon are motivated shoppers, businesses are willing to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered year-over-year constant-currency sales growth of at least 20% dating back more than two years.\n\nEven if the AI bubble bursts and takes Nvidia and Microsoft down with it, Amazon's various fast-growing ancillary channels can sustain double-digit growth.\n\nWhat's more, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock during the 2010s. Investors in Amazon today are only paying 11.5 times forecast cash flow for 2025. If Amazon were to be valued at the same median cash-flow multiple it carried throughout the 2010s, and it continues to grow at its existing pace, it would have the clearest path to a $6 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These 2 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past couple of years, literally adding trillions of dollars in value to its shareholder's portfolios. Several big hedge fund managers were among those investors who made a lot of money by investing early in Nvidia. But now they're starting to take their chips off the table and place bets in a couple of other incredible artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nSome hedge fund managers selling investments in Nvidia include:\n\nStanley Druckenmiller: sold 71% (441,551) of his family office's shares and 100% (4,895) of his call options on Nvidia. Israel Englander: sold 35% (720,004) of Millennium Management's shares and 31% (6,910) of its call options. He maintains a heavy position in Nvidia put options, which give him the right to sell the stock at a certain price. Chris Rokos: sold 41% (105,453) of his hedge fund's shares. Philippe Laffont: sold 68% (2,937,060) of Coatue Management's shares.\n\nThere are many more examples of big sales from institutional investors. After the meteoric rise of Nvidia's share price, it makes sense for them to at least reduce their stake. However, average investors should be more interested in what big hedge fund managers are buying now.\n\nHere are two superb AI stocks billionaires are buying as they sell Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) vaulted to the forefront of the AI space when it added $10 billion to its investment in generative AI leader OpenAI in early 2023. Despite its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world before the AI boom, artificial intelligence is proving to be a substantial growth area for the technology company.\n\nSeveral billionaire fund managers saw an opportunity to buy more shares of Microsoft in the first quarter, including:\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen: bought 1,596,887 shares, reestablishing a position in the stock for his Viking Global Investors fund. Steven Cohen: bought 566,749 shares, more than doubling Point72's stake in the stock. He also disposed of options positions, including 1,844 put options. Chris Rokos: bought 274,232 shares, increasing his hedge fund's stake by 172% from the fourth quarter.\n\nMicrosoft's core AI product is Azure AI, which provides cloud solutions for AI developers looking to use existing foundation models to deploy new AI-powered software solutions. The company grew its Azure AI customers by 60% year over year last quarter, and the average expenditure per customer is growing, too.\n\nMicrosoft is investing heavily in building out its data center capacity. But management said it will take some time for all of it to come online. As a result, it expects an acceleration in Azure revenue in the second half of fiscal 2025. That's quite a feat, considering it's already the fastest-growing hyperscale cloud provider today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also offers its own AI assistants across its enterprise software portfolio, which is called Copilot. Adoption is growing quickly, with customers increasing 60% quarter over quarter. With over 400 million Office 365 commercial seats, there's a long runway for growth for the product.\n\nThe stock currently trades around 30 times forward earnings estimates. While that's a significant premium to the S&P 500, the stock seems well worth the price. It's leadership in enterprise software solutions and AI development should provide years of outsized growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has long been at the forefront of AI development. Machine learning algorithms form the backbone of the content feeds on Facebook and Instagram, along with the up-and-coming Threads, which recently passed 200 million monthly active users.\n\nRecently, it's turned its attention to generative AI, developing and open-sourcing the Llama family of foundation models, which are behind its Meta AI feature in Instagram and Facebook as well as many other behind-the-scenes features. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the ambition to turn Meta into \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\nBillionaires are buying into Zuckerberg's vision and putting their money into the stock. Some high-profile purchases in the first quarter include:\n\nChris Rokos: bought 377,551 shares, reestablishing a position for his hedge fund for the first time since 2022. Ray Dalio: added 327,992 shares of the stock, increasing Bridgewater Associates' stake by 49%. Stanley Druckenmiller: bought 63,930 shares, reestablishing a position.\n\nWhile Meta already uses AI across its family of apps for content recommendations, it's starting to integrate it into its advertising services. Zuckerberg said he sees a day when \"advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business's objective and a budget, and we're going to do the rest for them,\" during Meta's second-quarter earnings call. He also sees Meta facilitating the creation of AI service agents for business, which opens the door for more business messaging monetization opportunities.\n\nPut it all together, and AI will have a considerable impact on Meta's continued revenue growth. Increased engagement combined with lower hurdles to creating and targeting advertisements and improving the algorithms needed to target those advertisements as accurately as possible should all result in strong revenue and profit growth for the social media company. Meanwhile, its hardware business, including its Oculus VR headsets and Ray-Ban sunglasses, is showing strong growth bolstered by its AI features.\n\nMeta shares currently trade around 23 times forward earnings estimates, which is considerably lower than most AI stocks. That's despite the fact that Meta's bottom line continues to grow at a steady rate in the mid to high double digits, giving it a very attractive PEG ratio. Its continued investments in AI should ultimately produce strong returns for the company and its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Set-and-Forget Retirement Stocks With Potential to Pay You Forever",
        "content": "More and more Americans are looking for reliable, long-term stocks to bolster their retirement portfolios. While Americans continue to look for ways to retire younger, it is becoming harder to save for retirement. The effects of inflation and rising housing costs and future medical expenses have made it harder to retire. One way to counteract the rising issue is to bolster future income through income-producing stocks that investors can set and forget.\n\nThere are certain stocks that will effectively pay investors forever through a combination of dividends, growth, and compounding through reinvestment. Investing in these assets can help to relieve the retirement crisis that many economists continue to warn about.\n\nFuture retirees are likely to require substantial funding based on current trends. Today’s 60-year-olds spend an average of $5,445 monthly, 18% more than the general population. Those figures are going to rise in the future as inflation continues. Again, counteracting those effects through wise investments today is key.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSempra (SRE) The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in companies that build and operate energy infrastructure like Sempra (NYSE:SRE) is a great way to get paid over the long term. Utilities stocks are well-known for their income generation and their relative stability makes them a set-and-forget opportunity.\n\nThe firm operates energy infrastructure in California, Texas, Mexico, and engages in LNG exports. That covers regulated natural gas and electricity services.\n\nSempra includes a dividend yielding 3.1% and is forecast for steady growth over the long term. Earnings growth is expected at a steady pace which suggests Sempra’s dividend is very safe. The company projects long-term EPS growth in the 6-8% range, again suggesting safety and predictability. The payout ratio sits at a healthy 0.56 and Sempra last reduced its dividend in 2000.\n\nSempra is one of many utilities investments worth considering for income generation. Texas is also experiencing historic increases in energy demand growth currently. The company is strengthening its infrastructure there to handle the increase. That investment, coupled with growth, should produce returns in the future.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a stock that most investors associate with growth and price appreciation rather than income generation. That’s fair given its position as a tech leader and massive investor in growth areas like artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft does include a dividend currently yielding 0.7%. It has never been reduced since it was instituted in 2003. It has also grown by 10% over the last five years. It’s certainly a more modest yield than many income investors will be used to but it offers growth that income investors are unaccustomed to.\n\nThe point here is that Microsoft is expected to dominate far into the future and should yield strong returns through price appreciation. Investors should expect big returns upon selling in the future. They also get a modest income from the dividend which continues to grow. The AI growth narrative is worth chasing but Microsoft is much more than that alone and deserves income investors’ attention as well.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important firms globally. Most investors are aware that the company produces the majority of the world’s semiconductors and something on the order of 90% of the most advanced logic chips. Those impressive stats suggest TSMC, as it is better known, will continue to pay investors in the AI era.\n\nIt pays income in the traditional dividend bearing sense with a yield of 1.5% as I write this. That yield is up some following the recent tech/AI rout that has caused a market pivot away from tech. That’s an opportunity for investors.\n\nTSMC’s earnings are growing rapidly in 2024 and are expected to continue to do so into the future. That will further bolster the safety of the dividend which was never really in doubt anyway.\n\nThe long and short of it is that TSMC provides chips to everyone that are currently in demand due to artificial intelligence. They’re in demand for everything tech/innovation related and make TSMC a great investment at almost any time. Yes, TSMC’s P/E ratio is higher now than it has been at most points historically. I don’t think it’s overpriced though. Instead, investors are realizing TSMC’s place in the world and paying accordingly. It’s still cheaper than 54% of the chip sector by that measure.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Can of Coca-Cola, a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has perfected the formula for success over the long run. It has become a cash generation machine and a stock noted to pay investors forever.\n\nThe value of the Coca-Cola brand cannot be overstated in this regard. Coca-Cola perfected a soft drink formula that has created strong internal economics that are admirable. I think those strong internal economics are most evident in gross margins. It costs Coca-Cola very little to produce and sell beverages. The company has perfected efficient operation in that sense. It’s much better than most beverage companies in that regard and can charge premium prices over the long term.\n\nRemember, Coca-Cola does this at a massive scale that makes competition very difficult. Other firms can’t do much to shake up its empire. The result is a cash generating machine that provides income through rock-solid dividends. Coca-Cola is arguably the most reliable dividend income stock on the planet and that won’t change anytime soon.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), like Microsoft above, is a stock most investors associate with growth rather than retirement.\n\nThat said, there’s a strong case for investing in META shares with a set-it-and-forget-it mentality. For one, Meta Platforms isn’t particularly expensive at the moment. The stock’s current P/E ratio of 26.6 is lower than the median level over the past 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is arguably as strong as it has ever been in relation to its social media presence. The company owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make about valuation is that tech stock prices are known to be volatile. Yet, Meta Platforms isn’t particularly expensive at the moment. It benefits from a strong position in social media and the company is investing heavily in AI. Yes, the stock is up 35% in 2024 but it’s still not as richly valued as some may falsely believe.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American energy company NextEra Energy Inc. on screen in front of web page. NEE stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is beginning to look like one of the best stocks for the current era. Investors already liked NextEra Energy for its balance of utilities-driven reliable income generation and strong clean energy positioning. That bargain has recently become that much more appealing as AI is driving clean energy demand higher.\n\nThat story is well worn by now: AI hyperscalers are gobbling up electricity while they build out data center infrastructure that has driven a lot of AI growth thus far. They’re also promising to reduce their carbon footprints. Clean energy demand is rising as a result.\n\nNextEra Energy is a massive investor in wind and solar energy. The firm’s utilities business is well-positioned to thrive as a result. It is also set to continue rewarding investors through dividends that could reasonably be expected to grow quickly moving forward: The company’s earnings should increase if AI demand manifests as higher prices moving forward. That should drive earnings which could be used to justify higher dividend payouts.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is a great stock choice for retirement-minded investors. For one, it’s a stable investment boasting a beta of 0.50. It simply moves more predictably than the majority of other shares available. It’s also a growing firm with a very respectable earnings growth forecast into the future.\n\nWalmart is generally expected to produce low double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable future while revenues grow in the 3-5% range. That ability to consistently drive higher earnings growth than revenue growth is a big plus for investors. It’s indicative of the extremely well-run firm Walmart is.\n\nOver time that creates strong returns in the form of stock price appreciation for investors. Walmart also includes a dividend yielding 1.2%. That dividend, if reinvested into WMT shares, creates powerful effects over time.\n\nWalmart is also fast becoming a force in eCommerce and recently crossed the $100 million sales threshold. It has a lot in store for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. sold $10.5 billion of investment-grade bonds, its largest-ever debt sale, which will boost its cash pile as the company spends heavily on artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants Paris Spent €1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent company on Wednesday offered notes in five parts for general corporate purposes, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the deal, a 40-year security, yields 1.3 percentage points above Treasuries after initial discussions of around 1.55 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\n\n“Meta’s sale is a sign that their investment in AI is not slowing down and is likely to increase over the next couple of years,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman said in a phone interview. “Meta has an ample amount of cash, but it’s a more efficient use of capital to borrow money in the bond market.”\n\nA representative for Meta didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal is its biggest high-grade bond sale ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The social-media behemoth made its debut in the high-grade bond market in 2022, selling $10 billion. It returned to the market last year with an $8.5 billion deal.\n\nSome high-flying tech firms that saw their stocks soar this year amid hopes surrounding AI were pressured ahead of the global market selloff, with investors seeking more progress on the technology. Meta was an exception, with its shares jumping after the release of second-quarter results that topped expectations and signaled the company’s investments are helping it sell more targeted ads.\n\nIssuing bonds now gives firms like Meta increased financial flexibility even if they have large sums of cash on its balance sheet, according to Schiffman. Meta had $58.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30.\n\n“The name has been under-levered and they have been talking about raising their debt levels,” Schiffman said. Selling bonds gives Meta flexibility and it “can keep investing in AI and the metaverse.”\n\nMeta has been spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in AI. The company last week raised the low end of 2024 capital-spending projections, putting the range at $37 billion to $40 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta is one of 17 companies in the market Wednesday with investment-grade bonds. Blue-chip companies started returning to the primary market Tuesday after all planned deals to start the week were held back amid stock plunges around the world. Calm started returning Tuesday, with tighter risk premiums making funding more attractive and the average high-grade bond yield at 5.06%.\n\nAhead of the market tumult, dealers had expected US investment-grade issuance to total about $40 billion this week. There were $6.8 billion of bonds priced on Tuesday.\n\nBank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley managed the bond sale, said the person.\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner and Cristin Flanagan.\n\n(Updates with final pricing)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest Why Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL: Big Tech’s Big Spend on AI",
        "content": "The thrust for artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating with each passing day. The big tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL), are deploying more and more funds toward AI infrastructure, as indicated by their latest quarterly filings. Specifically, each of them has set massive capital expenditure goals, with the aim to reap significant benefits that AI promises to bring in the future. Let’s take a closer look at how much these big tech companies have spent on AI in the June quarter.\n\nMicrosoft(MSFT) – A big supporter and investor of ChatGPT, Microsoft has integrated the OpenAI software in almost all of its products. In Q4 FY24, MSFT spent $13.9 billion on property and equipment, which included cloud and AI-related spending. Nearly 50% of this amount is for data centers, which is expected to generate rewards over the next 15 years, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted. Moreover, Hood pointed out that the company expects spending more in Fiscal 2025, toward cloud and AI segments to meet the burgeoning demand.\n\nAlphabet(GOOGL) – Alphabet has not had an easy way like Microsoft. Alphabet had to build its AI model, Gemini, from scratch and seems to have done a pretty good job so far. For reference, Gemini was used by over 1.5 million developers in Q2. In Q2 FY24, Alphabet spent $13 billion in capex, most of which was directed toward servers and data centers. Alphabet’s CFO Ruth Porat stated that the company expects quarterly capex of $12 billion or more throughout the year. As CEO Sundar Pichai puts it, “When you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.”\n\nMeta Platforms(META) – Meta Platforms reported a capex of $8.5 billion for Q2 FY24, which included investment in network infrastructure, servers, and data centers. The company built its own AI model called Llama and launched its Llama 3.1 version last month. For Fiscal 2024, Meta revised its capex guidance range to $37 to $40 billion from $35-$40 billion, as the company focuses on AI research and product development.\n\nAdditionally, CFO Susan Li stated that Meta expects to incur significant capex growth in 2025 to support its AI ambitions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that Llama 4 model will require 10x more compute than Llama 3, with even higher computing power required for future models. Accordingly, Zuckerberg said, “At this point I’d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.”\n\nAmazon.com(AMZN) – Amazon’s cloud service provider, AWS (Amazon Web Service), offers servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security services. The company spent a massive $30.5 billion in capex in the first half of 2024. Amazon intends to spend more on capex in the second half of the year, especially toward AWS infrastructure to support both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is creating its own AI chatbot, called Metis to compete with ChatGPT. Metis will be powered by Amazon’s own AI model, Olympus. CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings call, “I think that the reality right now is that while we’re investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today.”\n\nApple(AAPL) – Apple spends the least on AI among these big tech firms, as it is not developing its own generative AI model. Instead, the company has planned to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products. Apple recently announced Apple Intelligence, a system built on years of investments and research in AI and machine learning. The launch date of Apple Intelligence Features was recently delayed to October. The company only did a soft launch for developers to test the features and help fix bugs, if any.\n\nAfter understanding the current and future investments in AI, let’s compare these tech firms using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting in the Market Sell-Off: 2 Top Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Top investor Cathie Wood didn't let the global sell-off scare her away from the markets. As the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for their biggest declines in almost two years, the chief executive officer of Ark Invest loaded up on technology stocks -- some of the players that were the most heavily hit by this movement to sell.\n\nWood is known for betting on future winners early on, even scooping up shares of these players when everyone else is avoiding them. She favors innovation and companies that have a vision -- and the expertise to reach their goals over the long term.\n\nSpeaking of long term, that's another key part of Wood's strategy. She doesn't worry about declines in a particular stock today if the company's prospects are bright. That's because she plans on accompanying it through its growth story and benefiting over time.\n\nAs a result, Ark Invest completed more than 40 buys during the Aug. 5 sell-off and about 30 sells, according to the fund manager's daily trade report. Some of these transactions are for the same stock, being bought or sold for more than one fund. This shows that, during the sell-off, Cathie Wood was more of a buyer than a seller. Here are two top stocks she just bought. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nCathie Wood added shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to five of her funds, including the flagship Ark Innovation ETF. The stock dropped 13% over the past two sessions, leaving them trading for about 34 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 40x just a few weeks ago.\n\nHere's why this is a fantastic deal, and one the innovation-loving Wood couldn't pass up. Amazon already is a leader in two high-growth industries: e-commerce and cloud computing. This has generated billions of dollars in earnings, and the recent revamp of its cost structure should boost earning power in the quarters and years to come.\n\nOn top of this, the company has put a big focus on artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of its high-growth story. It directly benefits from AI, with certain tools lowering its costs, for example. Even more importantly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells a wide range of AI products and services to its cloud customers, and this already has boosted growth.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in the recent letter to shareholders. AWS is supporting this idea, having already reached a $105 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to AI.\n\nAll of this makes Amazon a top bargain now with the potential over time as e-commerce, the cloud, and AI gather even more momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nWood added Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to two of her funds after the top tech stock, which already was reasonably priced, got even cheaper. Meta shares slipped about 2.6% during the Aug. 5 session, and today they trade for 22 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 25 just a month ago.\n\nMeta is another stock that's on the path to winning in AI, and like Amazon, it has already built a successful and highly profitable business. You probably know Meta well if you use Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram, the company's social media apps. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps every day.\n\nAdvertisers know this, so they flock to Meta to reach us, their target audience. This is how it generates the lion's share of its revenue, and the company has become so profitable that it even decided earlier this year to launch its first dividend.\n\nNow, Meta's focus on AI could lead us to spend even more time on the company's platforms, and that could lead advertisers to spend even more money there. Management aims to develop AI across its apps to help users with everything from leisure activities to business, and the company is well on its way. It's readying to train the fourth version of its large language model, Llama, which provides the knowledge that Meta's current and future AI applications need to operate.\n\nMeta is already delivering growth, but its investment in AI could generate a new era of growth down the road. And that's why now could be the perfect moment to follow star investor Wood into this top tech stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Data Center Stocks Poised to Grow 10X as AI Demand Surges",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding into various industries. However, not all companies have been able to benefit from this growth immediately. Lesser-known data center stocks, for example, are experiencing strong demand. This could substantially boost profits as big tech continues pouring billions into expanding AI capabilities.\n\nMassive AI development investments of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have largely aided infrastructure companies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) clearly succeeds as a manufacturer of the crucial chips powering AI. And, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) sees rising business from hardware sales.\r\n\r\nYet, according to Goldman Sachs, the data center stocks sector is expected to see the highest growth among all capital goods markets this year and through 2027. The bank forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% for data centers over the next three years.\n\nAs demand for AI surges, three data center stocks are well positioned for potentially exponential growth, with a solid focus on growing sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGDS Holdings (GDS) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nHong Kong-based GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS) develops and operates data centers in China and Southeast Asia. It is actively expanding its international footprint, so this could offer higher growth potential than its domestic market. The company has rapidly expanded its infrastructure capacity. The total area committed and pre-committed by customers rose by 5.4% year-over-year (YOY). Also, the area in service increased by 12.5% YOY.\n\nWhile sales increased 9.1% in the prior year and customer commitments grew, the company is not yet profitable. However, it heavily invests in building new facilities to meet demand and reduce backlogs. This strategy is well-aligned with Chinese government support for the tech and AI sectors, areas driving the growth of data center stocks.\r\n\r\nThe company remains undervalued relative to its potential. Its $8.09 billion enterprise value significantly exceeds its $2.15 billion market cap. This disparity helps explain analysts’ optimism, with all recent ratings recommending GDS stock as a buy. On average, price targets point to a 45% upside over the near term to $14.89 per share.\n\nVertiv (VRT) Abstract Futuristic infographic with Visual data complexity , represent Big data concept, node base programming. storage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVertiv (NASDAQ:VRT) provides critical digital infrastructure solutions as demand for data centers grows. The company designs and manufactures essential power management and cooling systems crucial for heat management. This includes advanced liquid cooling technologies that are becoming more prevalent as AI scales.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic investments in areas like AI and high-performance computing are expected to drive long-term demand for Vertiv. Data center spending is also growing substantially to support more digital services and complex data processing, which are integral to Vertiv’s business.\n\nVertiv has shown solid growth and execution. In its recent second quarter, the company posted EPS growth of 114.1% YOY and reported 12.6% revenue growth YOY. In addition, it raised its full-year outlook on strong demand and operations. The company has seen a 60% YOY increase in organic orders, largely from AI deployments.\n\nWith a record-high order backlog indicating future potential, Vertiv is well-positioned for continued growth. Analysts project an average price target of $105.37 per share, suggesting a 55% potential upside from current levels. This follows a 90% gain over the past year while it still trades 38% below its peak of $110 per share.\n\nSilicon Motion Techn ADR (SIMO) SIMO stock: Silicon Motion Technology logo on the side of its headquarters\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) manufactures solid-state memory drives that are key components used in data centers and other applications. The company expects its sales growth to be in the range of 25-30% this year. Recently, SIMO reported second-quarter earnings that showed a 15% sequential increase in quarterly revenue.\n\nShowing consistent revenue growth, Silicon Motion driven by strong demand for its NAND flash controllers and SSD solutions. For the full year 2024, it expects revenue between $800 million and $830 million, representing a 25% to 30% YOY increase. However, growth may be slightly delayed as the company implements new controller technology, after which it forecasts sales will return to increasing.\r\n\r\nSIMO stock trades at a relatively modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.6 times compared to the sector average of 34.1 times. Analysts believe SIMO stock has strong future prospects, with 11 out of 14 recommending buying it. The average analyst price target is $93.89 per share, implying a potential upside of as much as 58%.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) the Best Jim Cramer AI Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you “cry yourself to sleep.” Cramer said that this “nasty” selloff was expected.\n\n“It’s exactly what you’d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was “vicious enough” to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that’s exactly “what you have to do.” He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their “pants down” when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it’s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet “until we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.”\n\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn’t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he’d do it.\n\n“He’s got horse sense,” Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said there are no “safe havens” in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for “pain” in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\n“If you can’t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer is Talking About Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Amid Global Selloff?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about strong second-quarter results from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Cramer said Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) was able to make its targetted advertising better.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is spending a huge amount to have enough to have enough computing power and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he’ll spend maybe ten times of this after the next generation of its large language models more efficient than ever because the opportunity is so enormous.”\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 'Trump trade' is fading",
        "content": "The whipsaw 2024 presidential election continues to surprise. It’s been less than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris jumped from the understudy of the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket to the starring role. Now, polls show her tied with Republican nominee Donald Trump, and in some cases ahead, marking a heady turnaround for once-demoralized Democrats who now sense a chance to banish Trump for good.\n\nAnd just like that, the “Trump trade” has lost all momentum. The Trump trade is a set of investment choices premised on Trump winning a second presidential term, and, just as important, his party capturing both houses of Congress for complete Republican control of government. That would allow Trump to enact his agenda with minimal opposition from Democrats.\n\nThe basic premises for the Trump trade are that Trump would slash regulation, raise tariffs on imports, keep taxes low or cut them further, and ignore the mushrooming national debt. Higher tariffs are inflationary and might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. So higher rates are core to the Trump trade. The economy might grow a bit faster once it mounts that inflationary hurdle. The national debt is a wild card because nobody’s sure when the market will start to balk at unprecedented amounts of federal debt. But whenever that happens, rates are likely to go higher still. Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump claps at a campaign rally at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIf there’s one single company that embodies the Trump trade, it’s Trump’s own — Trump Media & Technology Group, which goes by the ticker DJT. Trump Media, whose main product is the Truth Social network, is almost a pure-play bet on Trump’s election odds. If he wins, it could breathe life into a second-rate social network that has barely any revenue, since Trump will once again be the focus of world attention, routinely making news through his own posts on Truth Social. But if Trump loses, his political career will be mostly over, and Truth Social, puny compared with competitors such as Facebook and X, will have little reason to exist.\n\nSo how’s DJT doing? Not so great. After going public in March, the stock peaked at $66. Then it tanked in the midst of Trump’s New York business fraud trial, bottoming at $22 in mid-April. It yo-yoed after that, regaining ground as polls showed Trump widening his lead against Biden, even after Trump's convictions in New York. Since Biden withdrew on July 21 and Harris became the heir apparent, however, the stock has mostly fallen. It’s now at $27, down 59% from the March peak and just $5 above the April bottom.\n\nOther Trump trades are less direct but still in retreat. Market watchers began spotting signs of the Trump trade in mid-July, when Biden was at his nadir and Trump’s election odds in betting markets peaked at around 66%. Around that time, economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research wrote that “’Animal spirits’ have taken on a whole new head of steam because of this growing feeling that Donald Trump is going to emerge victorious.”\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThe S&P 500 stock index hit its last record high on July 16, driven in part by the prospect of Trump winning the election with a Republican Congress that would keep all the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in place and maybe cut business taxes a bit more. Cryptocurrencies rallied, in part because Trump had turned from skeptic to believer, promising to treat crypto much more gently than Biden if elected. Some analysts also thought Trump 2.0 expectations were pushing rates higher than they would otherwise be, especially with the Fed poised to start cutting as early as September.\n\nThere were victims of the Trump trade too. In a July 16 interview, for instance, Trump suggested he might not intervene if China attacked Taiwan. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, Taiwan’s most important company, promptly fell 7%.\n\nNow, with Harris on a roll, Trump’s election odds have dropped from the peak of 66% in mid-July to around 52%. Harris’s election odds are 46%, with third-party candidates accounting for the rest. Harris’s rally seems likely to continue for a bit longer, given that she hasn’t yet enjoyed the “convention bump” that typically follows each party’s nominating convention. The Democratic confab begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nMarkets, meanwhile, suddenly have a lot to price in other than Trump. New signs of a slowing economy and out-of-sync central bank policies helped trigger a recent sell-off that trimmed the S&P 500 by 5% in one week. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have given back all their summer gains. Interest rates have dropped sharply during the last two weeks, as if everybody has forgotten about the risk of Trumpflation. Taiwan Semiconductor hasn’t fully recovered, but since Trump knocked down the stock in mid-July it has outperformed the broader tech sector, another sign of the Trump trade in reverse.\n\nIt's obviously an unpredictable election, so the Trump trade could return if Harris’s momentum stalls or something else gives Trump a fresh boost. It’s also possible a Harris trade could develop, based on the prospect of a Harris win with Democratic control of Congress. A month ago, a Democratic sweep looked like the least possible election outcome in 2024. Now, who knows?\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Dividend stocks allow investors to generate income without selling their assets. This setup presents several advantages. Dividend payouts can help with living expenses, and if you aren’t retired yet, you can reinvest each dividend back into the stock.\n\nThe good hallmarks of a promising dividend stock include rising financials, an impressive dividend growth rate, and long-term catalysts. There’s more to analyzing a stock, but those three components help out a lot.\n\nWhile dividend stocks can generate steady income, they can also outperform the stock market. Some of the largest corporations offer quarterly dividends for their investors and also initiate plenty of stock buybacks. You can also find smaller dividend stocks that remain under the radar despite outperforming the stock market for several years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you’re looking for dividend stocks that can generate income and gains, you may want to monitor these promising opportunities. Each of them has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date.\n\nGarmin (GRMN) Garmin company logo on a storefront\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) has more than doubled over the past five years and is up by 33% year-to-date. It’s fitness segment is a major reason why the company has been able to outperform the stock market. Garmin produces many devices, including the watches that many athletes use to track data for every workout, such as their average pace per mile.\n\nThe company reported 14% YOY revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024 as the fitness segment grew by 28% YOY. Fitness makes up more than a quarter of the company’s total sales and was the second-fastest growing segment. Only Auto OEM sales grew at a faster pace — 41% YOY — than Fitness sales.\n\nDividend growth is in the low single-digits, but the stock already yields 1.78%. That’s not bad for a growth stock that has outperformed the stock market for several years. Garmin also initiated a $10 million stock buyback in the quarter.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) continues to attract new consumers, and most of its new cardholders are Millennials or Gen Z customers. Wall Street investors have noticed. The stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has soared by 87% over the past five years. The average price target implies an 8% gain from current levels. American Express is rated as a Moderate Buy.\n\nThe fintech firm continues to deliver solid results for investors. Q2 2024 revenue increased by 9% YOY while net income was up by 39% YOY. American Express’ net profit margins have been rising for several quarters and recently eclipsed 20%. This development should support a double-digit dividend growth rate for many years. The stock currently yields 1.21%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express stock doesn’t only have a respectable yield and a growing business. The stock is also quite cheap at a 17 P/E ratio. Meanwhile, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have P/E ratios above 30, and those two stocks also have lower yields than American Express. The opportunity looks promising for long-term investors.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to impress investors with solid financial reports. It’s an outlier compared to many big tech companies that didn’t do as well in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe social media giant’s revenue increased by 22% YOY in the quarter while net income surged by 73% YOY. Meta Platforms closed out the quarter with a 34.5% net profit margin. Shares are up by 41% year-to-date after the good earnings report and have surged by 158% over the past five years. The stock only trades at a 25 P/E ratio and offers a 0.41% yield for investors. Meta Platforms will likely maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for many years due to its rising profits.\n\nDaily active users across Meta Platforms’ family of apps increased by 7% YOY to reach 3.24 billion individuals. The company closed out the quarter with a $58.08 billion cash position, giving it plenty of funds to invest or distribute to investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms (META) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 42.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.3%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.59, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.6% this year versus the industry average of 7.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Meta Platforms well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street sees ‘buying opportunity’ amid AI pullback",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks, a hallmark of the recent bull market run, have lost steam over the past month.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) are all down more than 15% over the period amid a broader market sell-off that's seen the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) decline more than 10% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 8%. Even as investors have begun to question recent earnings results from the group, some strategists don't think this is the end of the AI run.\n\n\"We keep our overweight to U.S. equities, driven by the AI mega force, and see the selloff presenting buying opportunities,\" BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a research note Monday night.\n\nRecession fears have driven the market lower as investors speculate over whether the Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy too restrictive. BlackRock describes these concerns as \"overdone.\"\n\n\"We think growth will be supportive of risk assets and believe markets are pricing in too many Fed rate cuts,\" the team wrote.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who holds the most bullish year-end S&P 500 target on Wall Street at 6,000, isn't backing down either. In a note to clients on Monday, Emanuel noted that the recent spike in the CBOE Volatility Index(^VIX), provides the opportunity for \"patient buying.\" Quick spikes in volatility, as seen on Monday, usually end with stocks higher a year later, per Emanuel.\n\nHe likens the current moment to the large drawdowns seen in tech stocks during the \"1994-99 Boom bull market.\"\n\n\"The rationale for AI, in a world where the global workforce is aging rapidly and efficiency will be critical to drive productivity enhancements, is greater than ever,\" Emanuel wrote. \"We view the current 'AI Air Pocket' as an opportunity to gain exposure to a long term secular theme.\"\n\nStill, if investors have been staying out of the large tech names because valuations have risen to an uncomfortable level, whether the recent drawdown has done enough to create an attractive buying opportunity is up for debate.\n\nThe equity research team at Goldman Sachs points out that while the basket of large tech stocks, including — Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta (META), Microsoft and Nvidia — is down 13% since July 10, earnings estimates have been moving higher. Since June 30, 2025 earnings estimates for all of those companies except Microsoft have risen.\n\nThis has brought a contraction of valuation multiples for the group of tech stocks, but they still trade slightly higher than the 10-year median average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The mega-cap tech stocks have dropped sharply, but their valuations continue to reflect AI optimism despite investor concerns about the likely timing,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Monday night.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are up big since the start of 2023. But all three megacap growth stocks have sold off in recent months and are now down over 10% from their all-time highs.\n\nWhen great companies go on sale, it can be challenging to decide which one to buy. And you may not want to sell out of a stock you like to buy another one.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a way to invest in multiple companies in an amount you are comfortable with and for a low fee. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) has sizable holdings in Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and other top growth stocks.\n\nHere's why all three stocks are great buys now and what makes the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF one of the simplest and most effective ways to invest in all three companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is growing into its valuation\n\nNvidia may be down around 20% from its all-time high set earlier this summer. But the stock has still more than doubled in 2024 -- which illustrates just how hot it has been.\n\nFortunately for long-term investors, the recent pullback in Nvidia seems mostly due to valuation concerns -- not the core business. Nvidia's stock price is up over 400% in the last three years, but its diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up over 500% -- which has helped keep the valuation (somewhat) reasonable. But that pace of growth is unsustainable.\n\nEven so, analyst consensus estimates call for $2.72 in 2025 earnings per share (EPS) and $3.74 in fiscal 2026 EPS. For context, Nvidia earned $1.19 in fiscal 2024 diluted EPS.\n\nNvidia has come a long way, but it is still valued based on its potential earnings rather than where it is today. The stock could begin to look expensive if there's an unexpected slowdown in demand for its graphics processing units to fuel artificial intelligence (AI) workflows or if competition adds pricing pressure on Nvidia and leads to lower margins.\n\nIt's up to the market to decide what it wants to pay for the stock. But Nvidia stands out as a solid buy until the investment thesis changes. The company retains its dominant market share, and there haven't been any red flags indicating its position is waning.\n\nMicrosoft just reported a banner year\n\nMicrosoft reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings last Tuesday. Despite the results being primarily in line with expectations, the stock pulled back as much as 7% after hours. One possible explanation for the knee-jerk reaction is that investors had grown accustomed to Microsoft blowing expectations out of the water.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt times like this, it's better to look at the actual results of the business instead of using its stock price as a yardstick. And Microsoft's results have been nothing short of impeccable.\n\nMetric 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Revenue (in billions) $245.12 $211.92 $198.27 $168.09 $143.01 Operating margin 45% 42% 42% 42% 37% Diluted EPS $11.80 $9.68 $9.65 $8.05 $5.76\n\nData source: Microsoft. All data based on Microsoft's fiscal year, which ends June 30.\n\nEarnings have doubled in five years, outpacing revenue growth and leading to higher margins. Microsoft has turned into a cash cow and has a sizable capital return program, including significant stock repurchases and the largest dividend expense of any U.S.-based company.\n\nMicrosoft is a complete company that is deserving of its premium valuation. The company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35 compared to 28.4 for the S&P 500 index.\n\nMeta Platforms is a great value\n\nUnlike Nvidia and Microsoft, which have P/E ratios above the S&P 500's, Meta Platforms trades at a discount to the benchmark. It also has the highest free cash flow (FCF) yield out of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a group of tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. META Free Cash Flow Yield Chart\n\nFCF yield is a useful metric for determining how much FCF a business is generating based on its value. The formula is simply FCF divided by market cap or FCF per share divided by the stock price.\n\nMeta's 4% FCF yield illustrates just how much of a cash cow its business is. It means the company could be paying a 4% dividend yield -- fully supported by FCF. But since Meta only recently began paying a dividend and the yield is just 0.4% -- a better way of looking at FCF yield is the amount of extra cash the company has to repurchase stock or reinvest in the business. In this case, it's tens of billions of dollars per year.\n\nMeta has been doing a phenomenal job leveraging AI across its apps to boost user engagement and advertising effectiveness. Meta is a great buy for investors who believe in the company's ability to continue monetizing Instagram while growing its user base and engagement.\n\nUsing ETFs to invest in growth stocks\n\nWhether regularly contributing savings to a portfolio or managing what we already have, we all have a limited amount of capital to deploy into the stock market. There are always plenty of good stocks to buy; the question is which ones to buy and how much to allocate to each.\n\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF invests in 71 different growth stocks -- including a whopping 57.5% in the Magnificent Seven. More specifically, 30% of the fund is in Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. This top-heavy concentration provides meaningful exposure to each stock while also maintaining diversification across different end markets.\n\nAnother advantage of the ETF is that the minimum investment is just $1, and the expense ratio is .07% -- or just 7 cents for every $100 invested. Buying one full share of Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia costs over $900 -- which may be inconvenient if your portfolio inflows are smaller. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF provides a way to maintain diversification no matter the portfolio size -- which is an advantage if you are looking to dip your toes into megacap growth stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms (META) Outperforming Other Computer and Technology Stocks This Year?",
        "content": "The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Meta Platforms (META) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Computer and Technology sector should help us answer this question.\n\nMeta Platforms is one of 617 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #9 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months. Meta Platforms is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nOver the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for META's full-year earnings has moved 5.6% higher. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.\n\nOur latest available data shows that META has returned about 34.4% since the start of the calendar year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Computer and Technology group have gained about 11.2% on average. This means that Meta Platforms is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nAnother stock in the Computer and Technology sector, GoDaddy (GDDY), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 38.4%.\n\nIn GoDaddy's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 1.9% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLooking more specifically, Meta Platforms belongs to the Internet - Software industry, a group that includes 141 individual stocks and currently sits at #93 in the Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks in this group have gained about 3.2% so far this year, so META is performing better this group in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nIn contrast, GoDaddy falls under the Internet - Delivery Services industry. Currently, this industry has 5 stocks and is ranked #109. Since the beginning of the year, the industry has moved +25.8%.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to Meta Platforms and GoDaddy as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Meta Platforms (META) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs META Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.4% over the past month to $21.23.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
        "content": "With its stock down 12% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n33% = US$51b ÷ US$157b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nMeta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 33% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Meta Platforms has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Meta Platforms over the past five years.\n\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.7% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is META fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Meta Platforms Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nIn Meta Platforms' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 3.9% (or a retention ratio of 96%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.\n\nWhile Meta Platforms has seen growth in its earnings, it only recently started to pay a dividend. It is most likely that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 22%) over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Meta Platforms' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Sell Before You Regret It",
        "content": "Although meme stock mania settled down after Roaring Kitty woke the internet chatroom favorites from their slumber, it doesn’t mean these stocks still don’t have a large, passionate following. The so-called apes just haven’t been able to circle the wagons again around the biggest names to drive their shares higher.\n\nMany popular meme stocks still trade at elevated levels compared to where they were before Keith Gill posted in May for the first time in three years. Yet, others are ailing. So despite AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) being up 70% since the rally began, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has lost nearly a quarter of its value.\n\nWith such wide disparities in meme stock performance, it means there is still time to get out before you regret it. Below are the three top meme stocks to sell if you want to protect your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) Mobile phone with logo of American company Trump Media Technology Group (TMTG) in front of business website. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. DJT stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media platform Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) is one of the first meme stocks to sell. It has nothing to do with politics (well, it has everything to do with it but more on that later) but rather with the business.\n\nTrump Media’s social media outlet Truth Social is a pale imitation of much larger rivals Instagram, Facebook and X. Where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has billions of monthly active users and X around 500 million, Truth Social has…no one knows. It doesn’t publish such data. The company says it is not important because it’s just starting out, so putting a figure to it is not useful.\n\nWhat is known is that traffic is falling. Between April 2023 and May 2024, site traffic plunged 39% year-over-year (YOY). No doubt it spiked again in the aftermath of the attempt on Donald Trump’s life in July, but that brings up the issue. Truth Social is primarily all about the former president. The members it does have are mostly adherents of his politics.\n\nIt will have moments when its stock skyrockets. But because the platform is so closely identified with him, it will be unlikely to grow beyond that narrow base. And that makes Trump Media & Technology a prime meme stock to sell.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) Tre BEV electric truck at the Hannover IAA Transportation Motor Show. Germany\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors in electric and hydrogen fuel cell truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) should get out now while they still can. The company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split at the end of June to artificially boost the share price above $1.00 per share to avoid delisting. It couldn’t hold the price. The stock is down 17% since the reverse split and will likely head lower.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe number of authorized shares fell from 1.6 billion to 1 billion. It has so many shares because it constantly dilutes investors to raise capital. At the end of the first quarter, Nikola had 1.3 billion shares outstanding. Last December it had 800,00 million shares. In 2021, it had less than 400 million shares. In a little over two years, it tripled its share count.\n\nYet, Nikola is selling trucks. Last month it reported it wholesaled 72 Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell trucks in Q2 and 112 in the first six months of the year. That may provide it the revenue boost it needs though it might not matter.\n\nNikola had a high-water mark of $45 million in annual revenue in 2022. It fell to $30 million last year. In the first quarter, sales were down 26%. It has a narrow window to gain a foothold before the competition comes rushing in. Especially in fuel-cells, where Toyota (NYSE:TM) has partnered with Paccar’s (NASDAQ:PCAR) truck-making giant Kenworth to introduce hydrogen fuel cell trucks, the window of opportunity may rapidly close.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) In this photo illustration the Upstart (UPST) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last meme stock to sell is online lending marketplace Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST). It uses artificial intelligence to sort out borrowing risks for lenders. The firm maintains that its models are better than humans at determining default risks. Yet, the lending market has tightened considerably. So, Upstart Holdings is originating more loans itself, exposing its business to greater default risk.\n\nMoreover, Upstart-powered loans are not backed by any collateral, which gives the lender little recourse in the event of a default. Considering 90% of all such loans were fully automated. That means the borrower didn’t have to upload any documents, talk to any risk managers, and applications were completed literally in seconds. Thus, Upstart Holdings carries significant risks.\n\nUPST is experiencing higher-than-expected default rates and loan charge-offs. Fair value adjustments to its balance sheet due to unrealized losses and charge-offs soared 50% in the quarter. They grew from $29.6 million last year to over $44.5 million this year. Worse, prime borrower loans — those are supposed to be the best borrowers with the least risk — are driving the delinquencies and losses.\n\nWhen even the top borrowers are having trouble paying their loans, and UPST is finding it necessary to originate more loans from lower quality borrowers, it makes the company one meme stock to sell right away.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The fintech world is buzzing, blending finance and tech in ways we’ve only dreamed of, with some amazing fintech stocks that savvy investors can consider.\n\nDespite economic downturns and regulatory challenges, the fintech industry has constantly evolved, proving its ability to stand the test of time. It has been a driving force in transforming the financial realm, making digital transactions easier, safer, and smoother for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, the fintech sector continues to grow and shows no signs of stopping. According to Fortune Business Insights, the fintech market is expected to generate $340.10 billion in revenue by 2024, skyrocketing to $1.15 trillion by 2032. That’s an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe future is indeed bright, and now is the perfect time to spotlight three companies that truly stand out. They’re like golden tickets for investors ready to tap into fintech stocks’ explosive potential. Each is geared up for growth, demonstrating excellent financial performance. So, let’s look at these three exceptional fintech stocks poised to elevate your portfolio.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V)has long been a pillar in the global payments business. Over the years, it has greatly improved its market position and adeptly capitalized on the worldwide shift towards cashless transactions. Just imagine that it can process more than 65,000 transactions per second, which is a true testament to its market efficiency.\n\nMoreover, Visa shared some impressive numbers in its recent quarter report. Revenue jumped 10% to $8.9 billion, although it did slightly miss analysts’ expectations due to a slowdown in consumer spending. Despite this, net income climbed 17% to $4.9 billion, and Visa wrapped up the quarter with a strong 54.7% net profit margin. This really showcases its lasting financial strength.\n\nFurthermore, Visa has hiked its dividend for 15 straight years, greatly above the industry average of 2.2 years. This continuous dividend increase is backed by an extensive share buyback history. All in all, it’s a long-term investment worth holding onto for years to come.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) A hand lingers over a bright blue tech wheel that says \"fintech.\" Bargain fintech stocks for June\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU)is a leading fintech company based in Brazil, renowned for its digital solutions that have revolutionized the financial sector in Latin America. It stands out as one of the fastest-growing companies in the market, with an extraordinary customer base exceeding 100 million. Over the past year, the stock has been a stellar performer, more than doubling the broader market’s return.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Nu Holdings is a financial powerhouse. In the first quarter of 2024, it posted a remarkable 66.7% YOY revenue increase to $2.7 billion, with adjusted net income escalating by over 100% to a whopping $442.7 million. Adding to the bullish outlook, NU’s operating costs have remained impressively low, leading to an efficiency ratio of 32.1%.\n\nLooking forward, Nu Holdings has an ample $2.4 billion in excess cash and a growing loan portfolio. Together, these factors position the company to expand into underbanked Latin American regions and boost profitability through efficient operations.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), a pioneering digital payment company, has been through tough times during the technology boom. Intense fintech competition caused its shares to drop over 80% from its all-time high market valuation, and its stock price has plummeted 15% YOY. However, a rebound is just around the corner, considering the company’s strong financial footing and innovations.\n\nFinancially, PayPal has topped its revenue estimates for the past six consecutive quarters. In Q2, it saw an impressive 8.21% increase in annual sales. Additionally, the company is now expecting an additional $1 billion in free cash flow and share buybacks that enhance its fiscal robustness.\n\nMoreover, as nearly a quarter of global retail purchases are projected to be online by 2027, PayPal is ready to take advantage. For example, its strategic initiatives like Fastlane are significantly improving checkout efficiency. Plus, its partnerships with major brands like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) further boost engagement and growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "Want to generate steady cash flow from your stock portfolio while having the potential to outperform the stock market? Some dividend growth stocks fulfill both of those requirements.\n\nA rising dividend is a great indicator that a company is growing. Companies can only distribute dividends if they are profitable, and dividends only go up if net income rises at a faster rate than the dividend growth rate. Net income can only continue to grow in the long run if a corporation continues to generate higher revenue.\n\nEven though dividend growth stocks often have sound business models, these companies are susceptible to pullbacks and corrections, just like any stock. These events result in higher yields and give investors the opportunity to accumulate more shares at a discount.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWondering which dividend growth stocks are among the best choices in August? These are some of the top picks to consider for long-term investors.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) only recently began to distribute dividends, but it looks like a solid dividend growth stock. The company has enough cash and rising profits to support a double-digit growth rate for several years. The social media giant has 3.27 billion daily active users across its platforms. That figure is up by 7% year-over-year (YOY), and that wasn’t the only thing up for the firm.\n\nRevenue increased by 22% YOY while net income jumped by 73% YOY. Meta Platforms continues to enhance its efficiency while delivering impressive net income growth. Headcount was only down by 1% YOY, indicating that Meta Platforms is generating higher profits while retaining most of its workforce. Also, the company had enough cash left over to initiate a $6.32 billion stock buyback. Dividends came to $1.27 billion.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is contributing to elevated revenue and net income growth. The company is positioned to make more AI investments due to its strong financials and $58.08 billion in cash.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) is a steakhouse chain that has been outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 39% year-to-date (YTD) and have almost tripled over the past five years. The company has a 33.5 P/E ratio and regularly delivers double-digit growth rates for revenue and net income.\n\nThe steakhouse chain continued that trend with Q2 of fiscal year 2024 results. Revenue increased by 14.5% YOY while net income jumped by 46.0% YOY. Comparable sales in the company’s restaurants increased by 9.3% YOY while franchises had an 8.3% YOY growth rate in comparable sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRising comparable sales suggest that people are eating at Texas Roadhouse and regularly revisiting its restaurants. It’s also been a boon for the dividend. Texas Roadhouse stock currently has a 1.47% yield, and the company has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. The stock is rated as a moderate buy and has a projected 6% upside from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The logo for Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is shown on a phone screen in front of the Microsoft logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the past few years in the stock market, the winners have been expanding their market share. Giant tech companies continue to drive indices higher and grow investors’ portfolios. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of those stocks. It has a $3 trillion valuation and has delivered a 10% YTD gain. Shares have roughly tripled over the past five years.\n\nRecently, Microsoft reported Q4 FY24 earnings which revealed respectable growth numbers. Revenue increased by 15% YOY while net income was up by 10% YOY. These numbers are lower than the previous quarter’s growth rates, but double-digit growth rates are still solid.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud was a major catalyst for the strong quarter. Revenue increased by 21% YOY to reach $36.8 billion. That was almost 60% of the tech giant’s total revenue. Microsoft is focused on leading the AI era which should result in more gains for long-term investors. The AI industry is projected to maintain a 36.6% compounded annual growth rate from now until 2030.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another AI leader. Its AI chips are gaining momentum and can benefit from a potential OpenAI partnership. Broadcom’s AI offering generated $3.1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. That’s a new high, and it helped the company increase revenue by 43% YOY. The high revenue growth comes amid VMware’s impact on the company’s financials. Excluding VMware, Broadcom reported 12% YOY revenue growth.\n\nThe tech giant has outperformed the stock market for many years. Shares are up by 33% YTD and have gained more than 400% over the past five years. Currently, AVGO offers a 1.46% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. The firm raised its dividend by 14% in 2023 to a quarterly payout of $5.25 per share. Broadcom is in the middle of a correction and has fallen by more than 20% from its peak. The dip may present a buying opportunity.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, the company issuing the card makes a small percentage of the transaction. That’s been American Express’ (NYSE:AXP) business model for decades. It’s also been a winning formula for investors. Shares are up by 23% YTD and have rallied by 87% over the past five years.\n\nAlthough the company has logged impressive gains, it still trades at a reasonable 17 P/E ratio. That’s much lower than the other credit and debit card stocks, even though American Express has been reporting better financials than most of its competitors. The fintech firm delivered 9% YOY revenue growth and 39% YOY net income growth in the second quarter.\n\nThe successful quarter prompted American Express’ leadership to raise its annual EPS guidance. AXP remains on pace for 9% to 11% YOY revenue growth in 2024. High net income growth brought the company’s net profit margin above 20% and should support a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has recently re-established itself as a dividend growth stock. The company delivered 6.0% YOY revenue growth and 22.4% YOY adjusted EPS growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. E-commerce and global advertising revenue both increased by more than 20% YOY.\n\nThe global retailer has been posting successful quarters that demonstrate profit margins are expanding. Those successes led to a 9% dividend hike, the highest dividend hike for the retailer in more than a decade. Investors shouldn’t expect Walmart to return to annualized double-digit dividend growth. However, it may be able to deliver dividend growth in the mid to high single-digits.\n\nWalmart can thrive during economic booms, and it can also do well during contractions. The retailer has established itself as the top place for affordable products and services. It’s also the world’s leading grocer. The company’s business model can help it navigate many economic cycles while delivering dividends and gains for patient investors.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) offers business supplies and safety equipment for more than one million businesses in North America. While the company operates behind the scenes for many organizations, its returns have helped it shine in the stock market. Shares are up by 28% YTD and have almost tripled over the past five years.\n\nAlthough Cintas only has an 0.82% yield, the company makes up for it with an impressive dividend growth rate. Cintas has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 21.37% over the past five years. That includes a 15.6% dividend hike earlier this year. Cintas now pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.56 per share.\n\nThe company delivered 8.2% YOY revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Net income grew by 19.7% YOY in the quarter, resulting in a 16.8% net profit margin. Cintas expects diluted EPS to range from $16.25 to $16.75 in fiscal 2025. The midpoint represents a 9% YOY increase compared to the $15.15 diluted EPS in fiscal 2024.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in TXRH, MSFT, and AVGO.

        "title": "Meta apologizes for taking down Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s post offering condolences to an assassinated Hamas leader",
        "content": "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is one of the most outspoken world leaders over the conflict in Gaza. The Southeast Asian leader has condemned Israel's actions and vocally supported both Palestine and Hamas.\n\nBut Anwar's public support for Hamas leadership is putting him at odds with global social media platforms, particularly Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nLast week, Meta removed posts from Anwar where the prime minister expressed condolences over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. Anwar's office blasted Meta's decision as \"discriminatory, unjust, and a blatant suppression of free expression.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Meta apologized. In a statement, the social media giant said the takedown was an \"operational error,\" and that it has restored the post on Anwar's Facebook and Instagram pages with a \"newsworthy\" label. The decision followed a Monday meeting between Meta representatives and officials from both the Prime Minister's office and Malaysia's communications ministry.\n\nMeta's transparency center notes that, in rare cases, the social media company will permit content that violates community guidelines if the content is newsworthy and keeping it visible is in the public interest.\n\nPrior to the apology, the Prime Minister’s Office said the removal of Anwar’s posts “deeply impacted the people of Malaysia…who are well aware of the suffering of the Palestinian people” and that Meta’s decision to censor Anwar called the social media firm's content moderation policies into question.\n\nOn Monday, Malaysia's communications minister said the country will \"look into\" developing its own social media platform for Malaysians, following a suggestion from a celebrity host. \"Last year, it was estimated that Facebook alone earned $600 million from Malaysia, but what have they done to ensure that the condition and use of their platform in Malaysia are safe?,\" communications minister Fahmi Fadzil told reporters.\n\nFahmi also said he'll work to ensure Meta does not censor any content from a pro-Palestinian rally on Sunday.\n\nMalaysia's view of the war in Gaza\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia, both Muslim-majority countries, have repeatedly condemned Israel's actions in the conflict in Gaza and urged for a ceasefire.\n\nIndonesian president Joko Widodo criticized the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, calling it a \"murder that cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nBut opposition to Israel is stronger in Malaysia, to the point where the U.S. has expressed its concerns to Malaysia's ambassador in Washington. Anwar met Ismail Haniyeh in May, after previous meetings in 2019 and 2020, before he became prime minister. Malaysia has blocked Israeli-owned vessels from using Malaysian ports as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven Malaysia's plan to privatize airport operator Malaysia Airports Holding has been affected by the conflict after lawmakers attacked Global Infrastructure Partners, a bidder for the firm, for its ties to BlackRock and its significant investments in Israel. (Anwar eventually selected GIP as part of a consortium led by Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund to take over Malaysia Airports, after GIP said BlackRock will not be involved in its operations.)\n\nMalaysians have also called for boycotts of Western brands like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks.\n\nHow are Western brands handling the boycotts?\n\nWestern brands are suggesting that global boycotts are hurting their earnings.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski suggested that a boycott helped contribute to the fast food company's first quarterly decline in same-store sales since early 2020.\n\nStarbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan, on a July earnings call, hinted that “headwinds persist in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Europe driven by widely discussed misperceptions of our brand.”\n\nThe boycotts are a headache not just for the big Western brands, but for the local licensees that manage things on the ground. Earlier this year, QSR Brands, which operates KFC in the Southeast Asian country, temporarily closed over 100 outlets due to the boycott.\n\nIn March, Starbucks franchisee Berjaya Food blamed an almost 40% drop in fourth-quarter revenue on boycotts. \"In stores, 80 to 85% of employees are Muslims,\" said founder Vincent Tan. “This boycott doesn’t benefit anyone.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Got Caught Up in a Sell-Off on Monday",
        "content": "It's no secret that recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) helped drive the current market rally. Since the advent of generative AI early last year, the market has enjoyed the start of a remarkable bull run even as concerns about the broader economy persist.\n\nThe combination of a carry trade and a rate hike by the Bank of Japan helped spark a worldwide sell-off that sent the major market indexes plunging. To make matters worse, news from Nvidia -- the poster child for AI, added fuel to the sell-off.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, \"Magnificent Seven\" stock Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) slumped 4%, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) fell 2.8%, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) slipped 1.8%, as of 1:58 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- revealed nothing in the way of company-specific news to explain the falling stock prices, which suggests many investors are keenly focused two other issues that had far-reaching effects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFalling dominoes\n\nThere were two separate catalysts that seemed to spark today's wide-ranging market declines.\n\nThe ongoing market rally encouraged some investors to participate in a \"carry trade,\" borrowing Japanese yen at historically low interest rates and using the funds to invest in market leaders, including the Magnificent Seven.\n\nLate last week, the Bank of Japan announced it would raise interest rates to 0.25%, up from 0.10%, in a bid to tame rising inflation. The move also boosted the Japanese yen, which has gained 8%. This sent Japan's stock market into a tailspin as investors sold their profitable trades and rushed to repay the borrowed yen. Furthermore, higher interest rates make borrowing more costly, which puts pressure on corporate profits.\n\nUnfortunately, the stock-selling spread like a contagion, sending markets lower across the globe.\n\nAdding to the market carnage was news that Nvidia might delay the release of its highly anticipated Blackwell AI processor. A story that first appeared in The Information suggested a production design flaw was discovered, which could delay the launch of the next-generation AI chip by three months.\n\nNvidia pushed back, saying \"production is on track to ramp\" later this year, but fair-weather investors were already spooked and rushed to lock in profits.\n\nThe AI catalyst\n\nToday's market rout aside, the next few years are shaping up to be a potentially profitable time for those invested in AI. Estimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, as recognized leaders in the field, these stocks could have much further to run:\n\nNvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for AI training and inference. Sales of its chips have set records, and even a slight delay in the release of its next-generation processor likely won't hurt demand. As the \"big three\" cloud infrastructure providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are well positioned to offer AI services to their cloud customers, as well as integrate the technology across a broad cross-section of their other offerings. Meta Platforms used the reams of data collected from the billions of users on its social media platforms to create its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which it offers to the major cloud providers for a fee -- representing a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the opportunity, investors would do well to remember that the adoption of AI will play out over years and decades, not days and weeks. As such, it's best to tune out the day-to-day machinations of the stock market and focus on the future.\n\nFurthermore, the resulting upside potential has driven valuations higher. That said, Alphabet and Meta Platforms are both still attractively priced at 21 and 23 times forward earnings, making them relative bargains. Microsoft and Amazon are both fetching a premium at 30 times and 34 times forward earnings, but given their historical performances, I would argue they have earned said premiums.\n\nIn a nutshell, the evidence suggests each of these four stocks is a buy for investors with a long-term outlook.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Markets are reeling this morning, but I would implore investors to do everything they can to keep a cool head. While I cannot guarantee that we are at the exact lows of this selloff, there are a number of market leading stocks currently trading at very appealing levels.\n\nThere has been a confluence of bearish catalysts over the last few days, which we will cover below, but what is most important is that stocks are on sale and the world is not likely to end anytime soon. It can be helpful to take a step back and see that even after this selloff, many stocks and the broad market are still up nicely YTD.\n\nSome of the greatest stocks and companies have moved considerably off their recent highs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and some of the best ETFs like QQQ and SPY.\n\nInvestors don’t need to go all in today, but building your watchlist and buying as the volatility falls should be the plan. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Happened to the Stock Market?\n\nLast week was one of the busiest of the year; we saw earnings from many of the big tech companies, there was an FOMC meeting, a weak employment print pointing to a possible recession and a huge policy shift from the Bank of Japan. If there were a period market to correct like it is today, it seems now is the appropriate time.\n\nSo why did these events cause such a rapid selloff? It started with big tech. At the earnings calls from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms investors were critical of the huge capex being spent on AI, while none of the companies had much profit to show for it. Fears of an AI bubble percolated, and investors began selling many of the AI darlings.\n\nIt should be noted that outside of the large capex, these technology companies posted outstanding earnings and still believe in the long-term value of their AI infrastructure spending.\n\nThen on Friday morning, we saw the second poor employment report of the week. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% and worries of an impending recession spread.\n\nFinally, the monetary policy out of the Bank of Japan threw the final wrench into this bearish trifecta. Japan has been far behind the other central banks in terms of tightening monetary policy and only just began to hike interest rates last week.\n\nThe reason why this affected the US stock market is a little complicated, but basically it removed funding for cheap money. What happened is that the carry trade is being unwound. Because interest rates were so low in Japan, investors would borrow money in Yen terms and would take that leveraged money buy stocks and other assets around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo essentially, because this funding mechanism is going away, many investors are being margin called on their borrowed money, causing further selling.\n\nWill Stocks Continue to Fall?\n\nI lean towards this correction being much closer to the end than the beginning. Although the causes of the selloff are concerning, they are very likely transient. Yes, the unemployment rate jumped, but the US economy shows no additional signs of recession. Furthermore, the Fed is about to start cutting interest rates, which will be a boon for the economy and stock market.\n\nAs for the Yen carry trade unwind, we are in the midst of it, but that too is being priced into the market right now. Unless there are more systemic issues related to it, then it too will fade.\n\nAs for AI, I think this catalyst is the most uncertain moving forward. Was it just hype or will it produce the productivity and profit gains it promised? I think it likely will, but it may be over a longer timeline than investors originally thought.\n\nThe big tech companies are absolutely gushing with profits and are growing their businesses at very impressive rates still. Investors are going to recognize this, and buyers are going to step in.\n\nLeading Technology Stocks on Sale (Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta)\n\nAll my favorite stocks are on sale today. Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Meta Platforms are all growing like startups, yet they are trillion-dollar, mammoth companies. Amazon is expected to grow its earnings 30% annually over the next 3-5 years while Meta is expecting 20%. It is a bit slower at Alphabet and Apple, with 17.5% and 12.7% respectively, but those are still great growth rates.\n\nAll the stocks in the group are also trading at reasonable valuations. AMZN, META and GOOGL are all trading below their 10-year median valuations, with AAPL still trading at a premium.\n\nHowever, both Apple and Amazon enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. But most notably, all these companies posted truly incredible quarterly earnings results, demonstrating the deep roots of their businesses.\n\nIf you are an investor that likes simplicity, picking up a technology ETF like Invesco QQQ might be the simplest strategy. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and has been one of the best performing ETFs in the market over the last 10 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBe Greedy and Buy Stocks when Others are Fearful\n\nEveryone knows the mantra, but when it comes time to be greedy, many investors are paralyzed. All of a sudden investors are talking about waiting for another leg down, but it never comes.\n\nYes, it can be difficult to step up and buy when it looks like the world is going to end but that’s how you get discounts.\n\nI will say, don’t try to catch a falling knife. There is nothing wrong with waiting for the volatility to die down and for stocks to start consolidating sideways. But don’t overthink this market environment too much, this appears to be a buying opportunity.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data",
        "content": "Market whiplash\n\nLast week started out with disappointing results from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the middle of the week both Fed commentary which nearly confirmed a September rate cut and outstanding Meta (NASDAQ:META) results lifted markets, only to be undone on Thursday and Friday by weaker-than-expected jobs data.\n\nEarnings season continues to plod along, with more companies beating earnings per share estimates than the long-run historical average, yet the amount by which these companies are beating is less than usual. Mega tech results, closely watched for signs of continuing artificial intelligence demand, came in mixed. In addition to AI updates, there were other key metrics that investors were watching closely. For Microsoft, slowing cloud revenues caused investor's to punish the stock after the report.[1] Meta shares were rewarded after they reported strong ad revs and better-than-expected revenue guidance for Q3.[2] By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock took a leg lower after reporting waning ad revenues.[3] Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the wild card here, and although sales in China continued to bottom-out, better-than-expected revenues for the iPhone and Services segments led to an uptick after the report.[4]\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 11.50% year over year, an increase from 9.80% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 59% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nThe FOMC meeting and economic data were also in focus this week. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed the first rate cut since 2020 would likely occur at the September meeting.[7] There is also a high probability of rate cuts at the November and December meetings as well according to the CME FedWatch tool.[8] An additional three cuts are expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nNow the question is becoming whether or not the Fed waited too long to cut rates as certain economic indicators show signs of weakening. On Tuesday, the June JOLTS report showed that job openings slowed for the month, and both hiring and quit rates decreased.[9] The cooling jobs data continued on Thursday when Initial Jobless Claims came in higher-than-expected for the week prior.[10] It all culminated with a disappointing June jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) of 114,000 were well-below expectations, unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate in nearly three years, and wage growth grew less than anticipated.[11] In response, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all down more than 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe final (and busiest) peak week of the second-quarter season is up\n\nThis week concludes the final peak week for the second quarter earnings season with 3,908 companies expected to report from a smattering of industries. Big names include: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and more.? The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[12]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Fifteen companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), CSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX), IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX), DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), Caterpillar Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSX)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday Aug. 5, AMCProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday July 18, AMCDateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nCSX is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, Aug. 5, over two weeks later than usual, and the first time they've ever reported the second quarter in the month of August. This also appears to be their first Monday report in at least the last decade, as they usually favor a Tuesday or Wednesday report date.\n\nOn March 26, a massive container ship crashed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse and closing the port for the majority of the second quarter. Baltimore is the second-largest coal export port, and CSX has a major coal shipping segment which was negatively impacted by the closing of the port.[13] In the quarters prior to this disaster, CSX and its peers have been dealing with a global freight recession, which experts believe has bottomed, but freight rates will likely remain low in 2025 on the road to recovery.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday August 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nCaterpillar is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. This also pushed results into the 32nd week of the year, while the industrials giant tends to report in the 30th or 31st week of the year. This would be the latest second-quarter report ever for CAT.\n\nCaterpillar tends to serve as a bellwether for global economic health as the world's leading manufacturer of machinery and construction equipment. Last quarter the company warned that sales were cooling as dealers tightened up on equipment inventories after a multi-month boom in demand.[14] Investor's will be looking for updates on machinery sales which could indicate something broader about the global economy.\n\nVF Corp. (NYSE:VFC)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday Aug. 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nVF Corp. is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. Since switching to a fiscal year end of March 31 in 2018, this is the latest they've reported first-quarter results, and the first time they've reported them in the 32nd week of the year.\n\nOn May 22, VFC announced they had tapped Spotify's Paul Vogel as their new CFO.[15] Vogel took his post on July 8, which could explain the later than usual earnings date. VFC like many other apparel companies has struggled this year to attract consumers that are increasingly more discerning with how they spend their discretionary dollars, especially as many of the brands they own (North Face, Vans, Timberland) tend to be on the middle-higher end.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis marks the final peak week of the second-quarter earnings season, with 3,908 companies expected to report. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,411 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 80% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000+ global names), and 37% have reported results.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell roughly 8% in early trading as the Magnificent 7 stocks saw their worst intraday market cap loss ever during Monday's market plunge.\n\nAs of 10:00 a.m. ET the 'Mag 7' group was down more than $860 billion in market valuation. Together the Mag 7 stocks make up roughly 43% of the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) weighting.\n\nThe other components of the group also dropped with Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) and Meta (META) falling more than 3%. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) plunged more than 5%.\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) dropped more than 8% while software maker Microsoft (MSFT) plunged 5%.\n\nIndividual company news also put pressure on the Mag 7 stocks.\n\nApple (AAPL) dropped more than 4% after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) revealed over the weekend it had cut half of its stake in the iPhone maker.\n\nAI chip heavyweight Nvidia fell as much as 13% at the market open to pare some of its losses. Analysts noted recent negative catalysts weighing on the stock.\n\nThe Information reported the company's upcoming next-generation AI chips will be delayed by three months, potentially impacting its biggest customers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta.\n\n\"Nvidia has a window to sell to Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta while those companies are hot and bothered about building out data centers as quickly as they can. That window will shut at some point,\" Gil Luria, D.A Davison senior software analyst, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.\n\n\"If Nvidia is missing out on some of those sales during that window, that does have an impact on Nvidia's value,\" said the analyst.\n\nMonday's action follows a recent heavy sell-off on Wall Street as chip stocks have gotten hammered over the past week.\n\nOn Friday Nvidia closed off the lows of the session, down only 1.8% while Intel (INTC) shares cratered over 26% following a disastrous second quarter earnings report, and a broad decline in chip stocks led the tech sector lower.\n\nAfter the July jobs report, which showed job growth slowed last month and the unemployment rate reached a nearly three-year high, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped into correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high. Nvidia stock tumbled more than 5% Monday amid a broader market selloff. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Surge 500% in the Next 12 Months",
        "content": "Even with the stock market’s impressive gains, there’s no shortage of undervalued stocks if you know where to look. The recent correction has just scratched the surface of the tech sector. Those high-flyers have further to fall before being considered undervalued.\n\nHowever, if you’re willing to dig deeper, you’ll find plenty of overlooked names that have languished at undervalued levels for months or even years. I think it’s worth scooping up some of these hidden gems before the economic tide turns. Many of these companies have the resilience and cash flow potential to outperform once interest rates are cut and their financials outpace their stock prices.\n\nGranted, it might take longer than a year for the stars to align perfectly for these undervalued plays. But I’m convinced they can beat the broader market over the next couple of years as they recover.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Norwegian Cruise Line ship arriving at a port. NCLH stock.\n\nSource: Ian_Stewart / Shutterstock\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) operates a fleet of cruise ships that sail to destinations around the world. The company has been navigating choppy waters lately, as it had to take on significant debt during the pandemic to stay afloat and was then hit with spiking interest rates that crushed profitability and forced cutbacks in growth investments like marketing spend.\n\nDespite these challenges, I believe Norwegian Cruise Line stock is undervalued and poised for a major rebound in the next 12 months. The company just reported strong Q2 2024 results, with revenue up 8% to $2.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 40 cents, beating estimates by 23%. Both its segments have recovered in terms of revenue, and profitability should follow suit once debt servicing costs decline. Undervalued stocks: NCLH revenue by segments\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts are getting more bullish, too, with Macquarie recently raising their price target to $24. The consensus rating is still a “Hold,” but I think that will change as interest rates come down and profitability improves.\n\nNorwegian’s debt load has doubled since 2019 to $13.7 billion, but even a small interest rate cut would provide a big boost to the bottom line. With the stock still 69% below pre-pandemic levels, I see huge upside potential as the cruise industry recovers. If you’re willing to ride out some near-term volatility, Norwegian Cruise Line looks like a very attractive risk reward at these depressed levels. The company is steadily improving operationally, and I expect the stock to start sailing much higher in the coming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nStoneCo (STNE) Cellphone with logo of Brazilian fintech business Stone Company (StoneCo) on screen in front of website\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE) provides financial technology solutions to merchants in Brazil. The company has been navigating a challenging environment, with its stock price trading sideways for the past two and a half years following an initial crash from the post-COVID boom in 2021. However, I believe StoneCo is well-positioned to capture a significant share of Brazil’s rapidly growing fintech market, in which it already holds 11.3%.\n\nBrazil has been ahead of the curve in its inflation and rate cut cycle, having started raising rates earlier and subsequently cutting them substantially as inflation subsided. In my opinion, StoneCo stands to benefit greatly from this trend in the long run, even though STNE stock has yet to reflect the company’s improving fundamentals.\n\nAccording to recent analyst estimates, StoneCo’s EPS is projected to grow from $1.20 in 2024 to $2.60 by 2027. Revenue and operating profits are both expected to recover and keep growing, and I think the stock should, too. STNE financial estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAs UBS recently upgraded the stock, I believe the time for a breakout is near, and the stock is poised to catch up with the company’s solid financial performance.\n\nTeleperformance (TLPFY) GREE stock: Five young customer support specialists sit in a row at computers with headsets on.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTeleperformance (OTCMKTS:TLPFY) provides customer experience management and business services solutions worldwide. The company has been facing challenges recently, with its stock price still down 72% from its 2021 peak following rising interest rates.\n\nTLPFY used to be one of the most consistent stocks, often outperforming the broader market. However, higher rates have hit the company hard. I believe a turnaround may be underway, though, as global rates start to ease. With Teleperformance’s solid fundamentals, this could be an exceptional long-term buying opportunity, sweetened by a 3.24% dividend yield.\n\nIn H1 2024, Teleperformance reported accelerating growth and increased free cash flow (“H1 2024 revenue: €5,076 million, up +28.2% as reported and +1.7% pro forma | Q2 2024 revenue: €2,534 million, up +29.7% as reported and +2.4% pro forma”).\n\nThe company is also seeing the first effects of cost synergies from its Majorel acquisition. Some see Teleperformance as well-positioned with a resilient, diversified client base. Others are more cautious, given the uncertain macro environment. Regardless, I believe Teleperformance can weather this storm and is quite undervalued.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) provides mobile payment and financial services through its Square and Cash App platforms. The company has faced challenges recently, with high interest rates causing banks and merchants to be more cautious and transaction volumes slowing down. SQ stock has been stuck in a rut along with many other fintech stocks, as the post-pandemic rush of users has subsided and account growth figures seem stagnant.\n\nHowever, I believe most fintech stocks, including Block, are poised for a comeback as interest rates start to decline and we enter a new economic cycle. Block’s core financials have been impressive, with the company reporting $6.16 billion in revenue and EPS of 93 cents in Q2 2024, beating analysts’ estimates on the bottom line. The company has turned into a profitable growth stock and should be trading at a much higher valuation.\n\nThat said, Block is not without its challenges. The company is currently under federal investigation for potential breaches in know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules.\n\nNevertheless, the majority of Wall Street analysts maintain a “Moderate Buy” rating on SQ stock, with an average price target of $88.9, representing a 48.4% upside. If Wall Street paid even half the pre-COVID earnings premium, the stock would trade at $150 today. Block financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAs the gap between the stock’s price and the company’s strong financials continues to widen, I believe a breakout is inevitable. While it may take longer than 12 months for the stock to surge 500%, I think patient investors will be rewarded in the long run.\n\nSnap Inc (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NASDAQ:SNAP) stock has been one of the weakest social media stocks over the past few years, and it has continued to disappoint investors like myself. Despite my frustrations, I still believe Snap could be a good long-term holding if they can turn things around.\n\nAfter Snap’s weak Q2 guidance, the stock has slumped to around $10, which looks cheap considering the company is still delivering double-digit revenue growth. However, Snap urgently needs to improve its average revenue per user to stage a comeback like Meta (NASDAQ:META) did. It missed in the near term, but the long-term looks very promising. I can make the same argument about SNAP like I did with SQ. Growth hasn’t slowed by that much and it can still trade near pre-COVID multiples if management doesn’t make a fool of themselves going forward. SNAP Financial Estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe recent earnings show it will take longer than hoped, but potential catalysts like a TikTok ban in the U.S. could reignite interest in Snapchat. If Snap can find ways to better monetize its large, young user base, the stock has huge upside potential. But until they prove they can execute, you should still stay cautious.\n\nMethode Electronics (MEI) Metal die that says \"buy\" and \"yes\" on it with stock chart in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Sergei Elagin\n\nMethode Electronics (NYSE:MEI) has also been a big loser in the stock market for the past year and a half. It has lost nearly 77% of its value since the start of 2023, but I think it can turn things around once rates come down and the automotive industry makes a comeback. Analysts seem mixed about the stock. Jefferies recently initiated MEI with “Hold.” The decline has pulled the stock back down to more historical lows, and if things get better, it could rally back up like it did in 2012.\n\nRecent news has been mixed. Methode reported a net loss in Q4 2024 on lower sales, but it did generate positive free cash flow and reduced its net debt. The company also won over $140 million in new program awards in the quarter, mainly in EV applications. If you’re willing to bet on an automotive rebound, MEI could be an undervalued opportunity. Analysts expect profits and positive sales growth next year.\n\nForward Air (FWRD) Blue \"buy now\" button on a keyboard with finger pressing down on it. French Election Stock Picks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Odua Images\n\nForward Air (NASDAQ:FWRD) provides expedited ground transportation services to the air freight and expedited LTL market in the United States and Canada. The company has hit some turbulence lately, with its stock losing nearly 80% of its value over the past year amid integration challenges with its acquisition of Omni Logistics and a sluggish demand environment.\n\nIt wasn’t always this rough for Forward Air, though. The company used to be one of the most consistent and stable performers in the transportation sector until the ripple effects of the pandemic sent shares plummeting. While the stock has bounced off the bottom a bit, it’s still struggling, down another 6% recently with the broader market selloff.\n\nHowever, I believe Forward Air could be a solid long-term bet for patient investors willing to ride out the current storm. Activist investor Irenic Capital Management seems to agree, recently amassing a 5% stake and pushing the company to improve performance or consider a sale. The Wall Street Journalreported that Irenic believes several private equity firms would be interested in acquiring Forward Air at a substantial premium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -9.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.06 points to a change of +41.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.84 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.35 billion and $183.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.6% and +14%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Just Made a Stunning Prediction. Is Meta Platforms Now a Must-Own AI Stock?",
        "content": "Despite its focus on its LLaMa large language model and new devices like Ray-Ban smart glasses, discussions revolving around investments in top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have mostly excluded Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nInstead, Nvidia is considered the clear leader in AI hardware, while the financial media has portrayed Microsoft and Alphabet as battling for supremacy in user-facing AI, including chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, cloud infrastructure, and productivity software.\n\nBut Meta is proving that potential investors can't continue ignoring its advances in the AI space. The stock has soared since the generative AI race began with the launch of ChatGPT, and it has outpaced its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven\", like Microsoft and Alphabet, in revenue growth over the last four quarters.\n\nMeta just reported 22% revenue growth to $39.1 billion in the second quarter, and operating income surged 58% to $14.8 billion as the company benefits from earlier layoffs and other cost controls.\n\nHowever, while investors were impressed by the company's results, sending the stock up 7% after hours, there was one statement in particular from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that could be a game changer for Meta Platforms. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe new king of AI?\n\nZuckerberg began the earnings release by telling investors, \"Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\" That's a statement that few analysts would have expected to be true a year ago\n\nWhile ChatGPT has gotten much of the attention in the generative AI race, Meta AI is emerging as a dark horse, ready to displace the chatbot that kicked off the generative AI era. If Zuckerberg is correct, Meta's AI chatbot will be ahead of ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Alphabet's Gemini, making his company the leader in generative AI, at least according to one key metric, usage.\n\nMuch like Apple has with its iPhone, Meta's properties, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, have allowed it to establish close relationships with customers. That's something that Microsoft and Alphabet's Google don't have, because their AI properties are mostly used for work or research.\n\nBeyond Meta's surprising forecast for its chatbot, Zuckerberg also painted a compelling vision for the company's future in AI.\n\nFor example, he envisions his company using AI to generate creative content for advertisers and personalize it for its intended audience. Eventually, Zuckerberg sees the technology being able to handle the entire marketing campaign with just a business objective and a budget. That would be a huge win for the advertisers that make up the company's customer base.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe also said Meta wants to provide every business on his platform with an AI agent, and he believes this will be a staple of commerce in the future.\n\nThe success of Meta AI is also reflected in the company's broad and growing reach. It finished the quarter with 3.27 billion daily active users, up 7% from the year before -- or more than 40% of the world's population. The average American adult spends 34 minutes a day on Meta properties, showing why the company is poised to take the lead in AI assistants.\n\nBefore ChatGPT was launched, Zuckerberg said it was incumbent that Meta control the next computing platform. At the time, he envisioned that as the metaverse, but it now seems clear that it will be generative AI, and Meta looks to be just as ready for that transition.\n\nIs Meta stock a buy?\n\nThe company doesn't have a direct way to monetize Meta AI, but it doesn't need one. As it grows and engages its audiences, businesses will spend more money on advertising to reach them and sell more products and services through its sites, growing Meta's revenue and strengthening its platforms in turn.\n\nThe company continues to burn billions of dollars each quarter on Reality Labs, and it's unclear if that experiment will ever pay off. However, the core business is profitable enough to support that adventure, and Meta still trades at a modest valuation. Based on its after-hours price Wednesday, the stock is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, essentially in line with the S&P 500.\n\nBut Meta Platforms is still seeing explosive growth, and it now looks to be a surprising winner in the AI chatbot race. The stock belongs in any AI portfolio and should continue climbing given its momentum, its extensive reach through its apps, and its prowess in artificial intelligence.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $657,306!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Nasdaq Market Correction: 3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy on the Pullback",
        "content": "What does up can come down. Investors are getting a taste of that adage right now.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index began picking up momentum in the fourth quarter of 2022 that carried over into last year and throughout the first half of 2024. However, with the index now down 10% from its recent peak, the Nasdaq entered into a correction as of the end of last week.\n\nShould investors be concerned? I don't think so. Instead, I view the Nasdaq correction as a great buying opportunity. Here are three no-brainer stocks to buy on the pullback.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nThe bad news for Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is that its stock has fallen nearly 13% below the high set in early July. The good news is that the Google parent's shares are still up almost 20% year to date. But the great news is that the best is yet to come for Alphabet.\n\nGoogle Search remains Alphabet's top growth engine. Revenue for the company's search business increased nearly $5.9 billion year over year (13.8%) in the second quarter of 2024. Fears that generative AI would present an existential threat to Google Search appear to be misguided. Google's testing of its new AI Overviews indicates that usage and user satisfaction are increasing with the new functionality.\n\nGoogle Cloud, once unprofitable, raked in $1.2 billion in operating profit in Q2. It's Alphabet's fastest-growing segment with revenue soaring 29% year over year to $10.3 billion. The artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind for Google Cloud won't wane just because the Nasdaq has retreated. I agree with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's proclamation in the Q2 earnings call that the company is \"in a strong position to control [its] destiny as the technology [AI] continues to evolve.\"\n\nYouTube and Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices provide additional growth drivers for Alphabet. Don't forget the company's famous \"Other Bets\" either. I think Waymo alone could make Alphabet worth much more by the end of the decade as the robotaxi market explodes.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock ended last week down nearly 10% below its recent high. However, this decline doesn't look so scary considering Meta's share price has soared almost 40% so far in 2024 and nearly tripled last year.\n\nMore importantly, Meta's underlying business is booming. Revenue jumped 22% year over year in Q2 to $39.1 billion. Earnings skyrocketed 73% to $13.5 billion. Critics who slammed Facebook as only being for older people are having to eat their words. Meta CFO Susan Li reported in the Q2 earnings call, \"We've seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the U.S. and Canada for the past several quarters.\" Facebook Marketplace has been a key driver of this growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta is getting better at monetizing its apps, too. The company has an especially attractive growth opportunity in increasing ad supply on videos. It's also improving the technology that determines which ads to show which users and when on both Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAI plays a key role in these efforts. It should also drive growth in other ways for Meta. For example, CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks that AI-powered agents will be as ubiquitous for businesses in the future as websites are today.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is an outlier in this group. Its shares are only around 2% below the high reached earlier this year. The e-commerce and fintech stock jumped last week while many Nasdaq stocks sank.\n\nHow did MercadoLibre defy the downward pull? The company reported fantastic Q2 results. Net revenue soared 42% year over year to $5.1 billion. Earnings more than doubled to $531 million. Adjusted free cash flow skyrocketed 368% to $678 million.\n\nI think MercadoLibre's growth story has many more chapters. The company's continual innovation is a key reason why. As a case in point, MercadoLibre is deploying 300 robots in its new Texas fulfillment center that supports its Mexican operations. These robots help reduce processing time by 20%.\n\nMercadoLibre's fintech business still has tremendous growth potential too. Its credit card business soared 146% year over year in Q2 with total payment volume more than tripling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street will support heavy AI spending as long as everything else is going great",
        "content": "Sifting through the financial wreckage of last week's pullback illuminates an evolution in the AI trade.\n\nAs Big Tech giants reported results this earnings season, Wall Street didn't mind heavy AI spending, but with one key caveat: Everything else in the business had to be humming along.\n\nThe big winner of this shift was Meta (META), with its CEO Mark Zuckerberg — fully embracing his post-metaverse, gold chain glow-up — showing that investors won't automatically shy away from massive investments with an uncertain future.\n\n\"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year,\" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nThe warning of bigger AI outlays didn't deter Wall Street. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, speaks at the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, July 29, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat's because Zuckerberg and company delivered on the top and bottom lines, flashing financial strength even as they pushed the tech world's boundaries for capital expenditures. Revenue grew 22% in the second quarter and income grew 58%.\n\nAnd despite losses at its Reality Labs segment reaching $4.5 billion during the quarter, this spending fell to 31% from almost 40% as a share of its total income from operations.\n\nAs Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call last week, \"We are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we're seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future. And I plan to fully seize that opportunity.\"\n\nBut as soon as tech companies confessed some weakness in their core operations, that's when the trouble started. And Meta's peers revealed the flip side of that dynamic.\n\nReactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) showed AI investments can become a liability when key business lines fail to meet expectations.\n\nThursday's report from Amazon, which disclosed a weaker sales and profit outlook, wrapped a wave of Big Tech results that highlighted impatience over massive AI spending.\n\nCloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet posted lower-than-expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors fleeing.\n\nThe key difference — as the broader market contends with last week's bruising jobs report — is that Facebook's parent company dazzled at the basics, making its outsized spending seem like an ambitious proposition instead of a misguided adventure.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, AI spending is necessary for such a promising, long-term bet. Underinvesting, in his view, is the riskier path, since the downside is falling behind while the rest of the industry and the world transforms.\n\nBut investors and analysts are no longer taking daring AI plans at face value.\n\nIronically, Facebook's outlandish pivot to the metaverse several years ago serves as a cautionary tale — in 2022, Meta stock fell over 60%.\n\nSkeptics liken the recent frenzy over generative AI to Zuckerberg's prior pet project, which also cost a lot of money and dragged the company's share price into deep water. Wedbush analysts, standing in for AI bulls, say the analogy doesn't fit. They see AI development as a genuine inflection point.\n\n\"Is accelerated capex a good or bad thing?\" the firm wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly contrast this is not Meta/Zuckerberg spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe for building out the enterprise and consumer AI ecosystem.\"\n\nZuckerberg appears to have learned his lesson, sticking his neck out knowing he's on solid footing with an unstoppable ads machine.\n\nFor everyone else talking up their big, expensive AI plans, Wall Street's message is more circumspect: We'll believe you, but show us the money in the meantime.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Chipmakers crushed on US recession concerns",
        "content": "Shares in chipmakers plummeted significantly on Monday amid a global market sell-off, with Japanese stocks plunging by more than 12% due to growing concerns over a potential U.S. recession.\n\nThe fears spurred investors to flee from riskier assets, betting that a series of swift rate cuts might be necessary to support economic growth.\n\nSafe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw substantial gains as investors unwound crowded carry trades, leading to speculation that some were selling profitable positions to cover losses elsewhere. The intensity of the sell-off triggered circuit breakers across Asian exchanges.\n\nSemiconductor stocks, many of which enjoyed substantial gains in recent years driven by the AI boom, fell sharply in premarket trading Monday. The AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was down 9% at the time of writing, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged 5%, 4% and 4.6%.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 6.5%, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) tumbled 7.6%, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) dipped 5%.\n\nBut the sell-off extends much beyond chipmakers, with Nasdaq 100 Futures futures tumbling 4.7%, and S&P 500 futures falling 2.8%, reflecting the global nature of the market turmoil.\n\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures declined 2.1%, while FTSE futures slipped 1.2%. Japan's Nikkei dropped a staggering 12.4%, reaching seven-month lows, a level of decline not seen since the 2011 financial crisis.\n\nThe MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 4.2%. Chinese blue chips, however, were relatively resilient, dipping only 0.5%, helped by a rise in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.\n\nJapanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply by 17 basis points to 0.788%, the lowest since April, as markets re-evaluated the likelihood of another rate hike from the Bank of Japan.\n\nU.S. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with United States 10-Year dropping to 3.767%, the lowest since mid-2023. United States 2-Year decreased to 3.818%, and the yield curve could soon invert, a pattern historically associated with recessions.\n\nThe weak July payrolls report has led markets to price in a 78% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September by a full 50 basis points. Futures suggest a total of 122 basis points in cuts for the year, with rates expected to be around 3.0% by the end of 2025.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note, adding that the risk is somewhat mitigated by the Fed's ability to ease policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street bank now anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December.\n\n\"The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks. If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September,” analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan was more pessimistic, assigning a 50% probability of a U.S. recession.\n\n\"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November,\" said the bank’s economists.\n\nThe significant drop in Treasury yields has overshadowed the U.S. dollar's typical safe-haven appeal, dragging the currency down 1.1% against a basket of major currencies. The dollar fell 2% against the yen to 143.10, while the euro dropped 1.9% to 156.35 yen. However, the euro held steady against the dollar at $1.0934.\n\nInvestors also increased bets that other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease policy more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now expected to cut rates by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nIn the commodity markets, gold traded relatively flat at $2,431.62.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmakers crushed on US recession concerns\n\nStocks trampled, Nikkei tumbles past Black Monday milestone\n\nEuropean stocks plunge on recession fears\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why now is the time to buy the Nvidia sell-off",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) “relief rally” on Wednesday was short-lived. The stock hit its lowest level since May, falling as much as 7% on Friday and wiping out its gains from earlier in the week amid a broader unraveling across the tech sector.\n\nThe Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory, driven not only by signs of a slowing economy but also by fears that a handful of tech’s biggest players are overspending on AI.\n\nBut that latter factor — a pledge to invest more in AI — should be viewed as a “catalyst” for Nvidia and other AI chipmakers.\n\nWall Street pros were quick to tell Yahoo Finance this week that the AI trade is far from over, and the recent pullback should be viewed as a chance to scoop up shares. While the Big Tech companies are struggling to show the fruits of their AI labor, they're still committed to spending on chips for the long term.\n\n“It's a good buying opportunity given the prospects of the broader market,” Winthrop Capital Management’s Luke Stone told me following Nvidia competitor AMD’s (AMD) strong revenue forecast.\n\n“You’re seeing this delineation between the chip manufacturers and their customers, who have to invest more and more into the product and are really struggling,” Winthrop added.\n\nJust this past quarter, Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) posted more than $40 billion in expenditures. Amazon (AMZN) totaled $30 billion in spending during the first six months of the year and plans to spend even more in the second half. All have said the majority of that money is going toward AI.\n\nThat’s not what the market wanted to hear. Shares of Amazon and Microsoft closed the week lower, similar to the drop in Alphabet shares last week, as investors made it clear the AI trade has turned into a show-me story.\n\nBut what’s worrisome for hyperscalers is good news for Nvidia and its peers.\n\n“We've continued to see the [capital expenditures] guides actually go up materially and that's really what's important,” Bernstein managing director Stacy Rasgon told me. “People worry about sustainability but it looks like that spend, at least for now, is sustaining.”\n\nAnd that’s set to boost Nvidia’s top line, as Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue.\n\n“Fear that the revenue trajectory won’t be there over the next 12 months or so is now starting to ease,” CFRA’s Angelo Zino explained to me. “We think Nvidia is going to post some great results, and that is going to be a catalyst for the space.”\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this week, Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore argued the sell-off in Nvidia presents a “good entry point” and moved the chipmaker back to its \"Top Pick.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our perception is that the market is taking a very glass half-empty view of some of the hyperscale comments, where there is a clear desire on the part of customers to continue to commit resources to developing multi modal generative AI,” Moore wrote.\n\nSynovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan likened the opportunity to invest in Nvidia and other AI infrastructure stocks to suppliers who thrived during the gold rush. “Would you rather be the person who's digging gold or would you rather be the person that's selling the equipment to dig for gold?” he said.\n\nNvidia closed the week off 5% and down roughly 26% from its record closing high. Despite the pullback, shares are still up 116% year to date.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

        "title": "'She came to my wedding': Kamala Harris tech ties complicate Trump's effort to win over Silicon Valley",
        "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris has immediately complicated Republican efforts to win over Silicon Valley converts.\n\nDonald Trump tallied millions in donations from tech-world figures in recent months. But Democrats have long held an advantage there and the new presumptive Democratic nominee has especially deep connections to this community and its pocketbooks.\n\nHow this plays out in the months ahead could make things, at the very least, awkward, even for some of Trump's most ardent supporters.\n\n\"She came to my wedding,\" said Trevor Traina, one of the tech world leading the charge for Trump in a recent interview. He is the founder and chairman of digital wallet app Kresus Labs and was ambassador to Austria under Trump.\n\nTraina helped organize a recent high-profile Silicon Valley fundraiser for the former president at the home of billionaire David Sacks that raised $12 million.\n\nHis support for Trump isn't wavering, he said, but he also declined to criticize Harris personally in the recent conversation.\n\n\"Kamala is a dear friend of mine, and I like her very much,\" he said before adding, \"It's just that in today's world, candidates who want to be successful on the left have to toe the line on the whole Elizabeth Warren school of thought.\" Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two in Indianapolis on July 24. (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI via Getty Images)\n\nOthers say a change is afoot inside the center of the tech universe as Harris has quickly consolidated the public support of existing Democratic mega-donors and a new open letter from \"VCs for Kamala\" has over 400 signatures.\n\nHer campaign also raised over $200 million in national grassroots donations in her first week of the race.\n\n\"The change from Biden to Harris has absolutely shifted the environment in Silicon Valley,\" said Box CEO Aaron Levie in a recent post on X.\n\nThe well-known Democratic donor added that some \"were on the sidelines or wouldn't have been all that energized, but that has changed now.\"\n\nAnother indication of possible Harris momentum in Silicon Valley was a reader survey by the Information that found a jump in tech-world support for Harris.\n\nHarris's ties to Silicon Valley even extend to the familial.\n\nHer niece is Meena Harris, who used to work at Uber (UBER) and wrote a children's book about her aunt. She's married to Nikolas Ajagu, who, according to Linkedin, was formerly an executive at Facebook (META).\n\nA counteroffensive from Trump and his allies\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is clearly not going to cede any gained ground without a fight.\n\nOn Monday, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance visited Palo Alto for a sold-out fundraiser, according to an invitation posted online.\n\nStory continues\n\nVance boasts his own bevy of Silicon Valley contacts from a stint as a San Francisco venture capitalist and was back in the region for a fundraising lunch in the nearby town of Coalinga on Wednesday. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) pays for a breakfast order on July 28 during a stop in St Cloud, Minn. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) (Stephen Maturen via Getty Images)\n\nHarmeet Dhillon is a California lawyer and the former vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party who shared this week's invitation. Like many in the area, she crossed paths with Harris, once representing opposite sides in litigation.\n\nShe said in a recent interview that Harris's potential to shake up this aspect of the race is being overblown.\n\n\"She lives in Silicon Valley, but ... she's not part of the tech community,\" Dhillon said of Harris, arguing \"no one's authentically a cheerleader for Kamala Harris other than her immediate family members.\"\n\nDhillon also strongly disputes the notion that Harris could be friendlier to Big Tech than Biden. She is most focused on the Harris record when it comes to other issues like crime, which she said could be more determinative among the safety-conscious tech community.\n\nAnd Vance's selection has also already led to a thaw of sorts between the Trump campaign and one key tech billionaire: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.\n\nVance used to work for Thiel and the billionaire, in a recent New York Times interview, signaled new warmth for Trump while also remaining noncommittal about jumping into the 2024 race financially.\n\nThe Harris tech agenda\n\nA possible tech agenda for Harris, if she wins this fall, is also being looked at closely.\n\nHarris rose to national prominence in San Francisco and was known during her time in California for having a modestly collegial relationship with Big Tech. Donations from some of Silicon Valley's most prominent figures and their employees fueled her early runs for office, especially her 2016 Senate victory.\n\nAnd during her time as California attorney general, Harris often looked at tech issues but ended up focused on voluntary agreements with companies as she sought their cooperation on issues like sex trafficking online. Then Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg appeared with then California Attorney General Kamala Harris at a \"Safer Internet\" event at Facebook headquarters in 2015 in Menlo Park, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nEven during her 2020 presidential race, when Harris veered left on a variety of issues, she declined to call for the breakup of Big Tech as her rivals, Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders, did. She focused on regulating the giants around issues like online privacy.\n\nHarris has focused on AI during her years as vice president and offered a similar approach focused on largely voluntary agreements as Washington begins to grapple with the technology.\n\nIn a speech in London last November, Harris called out companies and accused some of choosing profit over safety.\n\nBut at the same time, she often courted AI business leaders and convened CEOs to discuss the issues. This helped shepherd a wave of voluntary business-world commitments to some of the plans from top companies like Adobe (ADBE), IBM (IBM), and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHarris has offered little in the way of public commentary on tech issues since entering the race but is expected to tout Biden accomplishments popular in tech circles like the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which is sending billions to semiconductor companies.\n\nA focus on those issues could be amplified further if Sen. Mark Kelly is picked as VP. Kelly has made the semiconductor efforts a centerpiece of his time in the Senate and helped shepherd much of the money to the swing state of Arizona that he represents. Kamala Harris poses with officials including officials from Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Meta, as well as Sam Altman of OpenAI on the second day of the UK AI Safety Summit in November 2023 in Bletchley, England. (Leon Neal/Getty Images) (Leon Neal via Getty Images)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is set to keep focused on the mashup of vocal tech-world venture capital figures and crypto libertarians he has assembled behind his candidacy.\n\n\"You are going to be very happy with me,\" Trump told an audience of bitcoin enthusiasts last weekend, arguing that across tech issues like cryptocurrency and AI \"we understand it, they don't understand it.\"\n\nAs for Traina, he expects that many of Trump's inroads in Silicon Valley will be durable as Trump-leaning technology figures are increasingly comfortable speaking out.\n\nThat going to continue to allow Trump, he says, to access a \"silent majority [in Silicon Valley] that was at the very least centrist, if not slightly right of center, but who were apolitical.\"\n\nTraina himself has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump and to other Republican candidates in 2024. But in yet another example of the complex equation in Silicon Valley at the moment, Traina himself had a very small role in the political rise of his former wedding guest.\n\nAccording to election records, he sent Kamala Harris a $1,500 check back in 2015.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia in a ‘bubble’ says hedge fund; Intel downgraded",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nNvidia is in a ‘bubble’ and AI is ‘overhyped’ - Elliot\n\nElliot Management said Friday that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is in a “bubble” and the AI technology causing it is “overhyped,” according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.\n\nElliot raised concerns about the longevity of high-volume purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) by Big Tech companies, suggesting that mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia itself, are in “bubble land.”\n\nThe hedge fund noted that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time.” It argued that numerous AI applications are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.”\n\nThis commentary comes as chip stocks, which had surged due to hype around generative AI, have recently faced setbacks amid worries over the sustainability of large company investments.\n\nElliott also believes that AI has not yet delivered the significant productivity gains that were promised, stating that there are “few real uses” for AI currently, other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.”\n\nThe letter concluded that AI, so far, is essentially software that has not provided “value commensurate with the hype” and that the current bubble could burst if Nvidia reports disappointing financial results, potentially “breaking the spell.”\n\nAnalysts raise price targets on Meta after strong earnings\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) delivered a solid report for the fiscal second quarter, leading to a wave of price target raises on Wall Street.\n\nOppenheimer analysts hiked their price target on the stock from $525 to $615 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock.\n\nThis adjustment signals a positive outlook for Meta's future, particularly following its second-quarter revenue results and third-quarter guidance.\n\nThe new price target implies a 24x multiple of the projected 2025 earnings per share (EPS), which is a 13% discount compared to Meta's peers and a 4% discount relative to the NASDAQ.\n\nOppenheimer's confidence in Meta is reinforced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus on AI spending, which is anticipated to boost future advertising revenue and user engagement.\n\nBofA Securities analysts also reiterated their Buy rating with a $563 price target on Meta, highlighting it as the \"top AI play in consumer Internet.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank upped their price target on Meta stock to $585 from $525, while maintaining a Buy rating.\n\nBofA downgrades Intel stock after disappointing Q2 print\n\nBank of America analysts downgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Neutral to Underperform following a disappointing Q2 report that caused the stock to plummet nearly 30% on Friday.\n\nThe rating cut was primarily driven by a weak Q3 outlook and ongoing profitability challenges expected to persist through the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nBofA analysts identified several critical issues affecting Intel, including its Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM) structure, which is seen as less competitive compared to more focused rivals like Nvidia, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (BVMF:TSMC34).\n\nFurthermore, the bank pointed out Intel's lack of competitive AI accelerators, which diminishes its appeal to key cloud customers. Analysts also raised concerns about Intel's significant restructuring efforts, including a 15% reduction in headcount and cuts to capital expenditures, warning that these actions “could create unintended competitive consequences.”\n\nAnother factor influencing the downgrade is the suspension of Intel's dividend, potentially making the stock less appealing to some investors.\n\nDue to these concerns, BofA significantly slashed its earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for Intel for the fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, and lowered its price objective (PO) for the stock from $35 to $23.\n\nHSBC cuts Arm rating amid less bullish AI PC narrative\n\nEarlier in the week, analysts at HSBC downgraded Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) shares from Hold to Reduce.\n\n\"We believe Arm has one of the best narratives among our tech coverage given expectations of significant content growth from rising royalties for its smartphones and future AI markets such as AI PC and datacentre CPUs,” analysts said.\n\n“However, Arm shares have continued to re-rate significantly, with y-t-d appreciation of 116%, and it now trades at FY26e PE of 72x – a significant premium relative to its largecap semiconductor peers.\"\n\nHSBC flagged short-term earnings downside risk ahead of the ARM’s 1Q25 results on 31 July, primarily due to a potential slowdown in Android smartphone momentum and a less bullish AI PC narrative.\n\nARM shares fell more than 20% across the last five sessions due to softer-than-expected guidance and broader tech sell-off.\n\nDatadog stock upgraded to Buy at BTIG\n\nThe investment banking firm BTIG upgraded Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) stock from Neutral to Buy this week, setting a price target of $143 per share. The upward revision is based on strong market checks and an \"underappreciated Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) displacement opportunity.\"\n\nAnalysts at BTIG highlight Datadog as a leading player in the observability market, poised for substantial growth with innovative products and features like Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, and Bits AI.\n\n\"In short, we see DDOG as the best play in the observability market with a large opportunity to gain share,\" they state. \"We also think new products and features (such as Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, Bits AI, etc.) create a compelling long-term growth opportunity.\"\n\nThe firm’s optimism is bolstered by recent fieldwork, which included discussions with ten partners, half of which skewed towards large enterprises. BTIG concluded that cloud cost optimization efforts tied to the broader macroeconomic environment are largely complete, benefiting observability spending.\n\nBTIG also noted that despite Microsoft’s slight cloud growth disappointment, the general trend points to improving growth at the top three hyperscale cloud IaaS providers, suggesting a favorable outlook for observability spending.\n\nFurthermore, BTIG believes Datadog is well-positioned to capture additional market share from Splunk following its acquisition by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). While this displacement is not expected to have a significant impact in 2024, it represents a substantial opportunity over the next three to four years.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia in a ‘bubble’ says hedge fund; Intel downgraded\n\nHedge funds grow bearish amid economic slowdown jitters, Goldman says\n\nDelay to Nvidia's new AI chip could affect Microsoft, Google, Meta, the Information says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThroughout this earnings season, investors have been especially focused on Big Tech’s capital expenditures.\n\nThis spending is seen as a barometer for how bullish Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are about what AI will do for them. Though, as Julie Hyman wrote Thursday, it’s a little more complicated than that, since they must go all in to even get a seat at the table.\n\nBut the nature of supply chain dynamics means that what gathers and melts in the mountains pours into the rivers and lakes.\n\nAnd as our Chart of the Week shows, Big Tech is still making it rain. And Nvidia is the lake.\n\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg, coupled with quarterly reports, more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from some familiar names among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks — Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nThe biggest transfer is from Microsoft, with spending from the world’s most valuable company accounting for 19% of Nvidia’s revenue. This makes the company its biggest customer by far, nearly doubling Meta’s spend and tripling that of Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAnd on the Microsoft side, Bloomberg’s data shows Nvidia accounts for 45% of its capital expenditures, whereas the chipmaker only gets 15% of Alphabet’s outlays, for example.\n\nIn the AI jungle, this data is a reminder that the chipmakers eat first, long before the hyperscalers can offer much more than hints to investors about when the AI investments will turn into AI revenue streams.\n\nStill, this is one of the key charts that have helped power the market, especially through the tech earnings season.\n\nFor now, the lack of revenue isn’t too worrying to investors — though doubts are rising! — as it’s still hard to imagine the trillion-dollar Microsoft doesn’t know something they don’t about the opportunity.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Evidence Is Piling Up That Provides a Clear Answer",
        "content": "There's no getting around it: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) early last year has been a boon to chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long been the gold standard for video games, data centers, and early branches of AI.\n\nThe uptake of generative AI kicked off in earnest in early 2023, making Nvidia the hottest ticket in town. Shares are up nearly 700% during that time as the company controls an estimated 92% of the data- center chip market -- where most generative AI lives -- according to IoT Analytics. Those gains haven't all been in a straight line, however, as Nvidia stock plunged as much as 23% during the last three weeks of July.\n\nBehind the slump are fears that the adoption of AI might soon trail off. After the company generated triple-digit revenue and profit growth over the past year, investors have begun to wonder if the end was in sight. The evidence has begun to pile up and provides a clear answer to the quintessential investor question: Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock? Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Getty Images.https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/multimedia/search?origin=multimedia&keywords=gb200\n\nThe question of demand\n\nGenerative AI requires a great deal of computational horsepower to run the large language models (LLMs) that underpin the technology. That, combined with the massive amounts of data necessary, makes AI largely the purview of the world's largest tech companies, which are also Nvidia's biggest customers. These tech giants have begun to report their quarterly results, providing investors with insight into the state of AI adoption -- and the evidence is compelling.\n\nDuring Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)second-quarter earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said of AI, \"We are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area ... aggressively investing upfront in a defining category.\" Indeed, the company's capital expenditures (capex) of $13.2 billion were higher than many anticipated, and Alphabet plans capex spending of roughly $12 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year. The spending was \"overwhelmingly\" spent on the servers and data centers needed for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 Q4 (ended June 30), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)also admitted to going on an AI-centric spending spree, with capex of $19 billion. CFO Amy Hood noted that \"cloud and AI-related spending represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures.\" Hood went on the say that fiscal 2025 capex is \"expected to be higher than fiscal year 2024.\"\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) spent more than $8.1 billion on capex in Q2 and is now predicting full-year spending of $37 billion to $40 billion, with \"significant capex growth in 2025 to support our AI research and product development efforts,\" accoring to CFO Susan Li.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's biggest customers\n\nThese capex spending numbers and the accompanying management commentary make clear that Big Tech plans to continue spending big on AI. Furthermore, the fact that much of this spending will be devoted to servers and data centers suggests that Nvidia will be the beneficiary of much of this spending.\n\nWhile Nvidia doesn't provide the identities of its biggest customers, Wall Street has done some sleuthing. Analysts at Bloomberg and Barclays parsed the numbers and concluded that Nvidia's four largest customers -- responsible for roughly 40% of its revenue -- are:\n\nMicrosoft: 15% Meta Platforms: 13% Amazon: 6.2% Alphabet: 5.8%\n\nThree of the four have been clear about their AI spending, and by the time you read this, Amazon's results will be out, and I have no doubt its spending on AI will be equally robust.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nThe past year has been a whirlwind for Nvidia investors. After generating triple-digit growth last year, the company followed that up with record results to kick off the current year. For fiscal 2025's Q1 (ended April 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that grew 262% year over year to $26 billion, fueled by record data-center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 427%. Profits also exploded higher as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its Q2 results after the market close on Aug. 28, and if the commentary provided by its Big Tech customers is any indication, Nvidia should have another strong showing up its sleeve.\n\nThe company's forecast is calling for revenue of $28 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 107%, with a commensurate uptick in profitability. It's worth noting that Nvidia has a history of eclipsing its own guidance, so the results could conceivably be higher.\n\nFinally, at roughly 38 time forward earnings, Nvidia trades at a slight premium, but given the company's triple-digit growth, that's not surprising.\n\nIn my mind, the preponderance of the evidence is clear: Nvidia stock is still a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is offering Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars for the right to record and use their voices for artificial intelligence projects, according to several people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\n\nThe company is talking with Judi Dench, Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the project is confidential. Representatives for Meta declined to comment.\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is racing to close deals so it has time to develop a suite of AI tools for unveiling at its Connect 2024 event in September. While it’s not entirely clear how Meta will be using the voices, it has discussed a chatbot that could serve as a digital assistant, à la Apple’s Siri, or a friend, the people said. Users could speak with a chatbot that has the voice of Awkwafina, for example.\n\nNegotiations between Meta and some talent representatives have stopped and started many times because the parties can’t agree on terms for use of the actors’ voices. Meta would like to secure rights to voices for many uses over a fixed term on a single project. Representatives for the actors are seeking stricter limits.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence has spooked many in the Hollywood creative community who fear losing work as a result of the technology. Screenwriters and actors fought for protections against the use of AI during labor stoppages last year. Yet SAG-AFTRA, the primary unions for actors, has reached an agreement with Meta on terms, according to the people.\n\nMeta has experimented with creating text-based chatbots inspired by celebrities like Dwyane Wade and Paris Hilton. The company has already ended that program. It has also unveiled an AI studio that allows content creators to make chatbots of themselves.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Trump Says Meta’s Zuckerberg Has Been Calling Him ‘A Lot’ Lately",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump said Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg called him multiple times over the past few weeks, including after the former US President faced an assassination attempt in mid-July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\n\nAfter a bullet grazed his ear, Trump was photographed with his fist in the air, telling supporters to “fight.”\n\n“He said, ‘That was really amazing, it was very brave,’” Trump said during a Fox Business interview on Friday, adding that Zuckerberg “respected me for what I did that day.”\n\nTrump said that the Meta CEO told him he was not going to support a Democrat in the election because of this respect. Zuckerberg has said publicly that he would not endorse any candidate for President, and has avoided making public endorsements for the last several elections. He did, though, call Trump’s reaction to the assassination attempt “badass” during an interview with Bloomberg in mid-July.\n\nTrump said that Zuckerberg called him again this week to apologize over how a photo of the assassination attempt was handled by Meta’s automated moderation systems. A photo of Trump with his fist raised in the air was incorrectly appended with a fact-check label this week after other versions of that photo had been manipulated to show the Secret Service agents next to him smiling. Meta automatically added a fact-check label to the doctored version of the photo, but the automated systems also added the label to the original by mistake.\n\n“Given the similarities between the doctored photo and the original image – which are only subtly (although importantly) different — our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo, too,” Meta’s VP of Global Policy, Joel Kaplan, wrote in a blog post this week. “Our teams worked to quickly correct this mistake.”\n\nZuckerberg “actually apologized — he said they made a mistake,” Trump said of their phone conversations. “I believe Mark Zuckerberg. He called me a lot.”\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump’s interview, spokesman Andy Stone reiterated Zuckerberg’s stance. “Mark’s already been public about the fact that he’s not endorsing either candidate, just as he hasn’t in prior elections.” The company didn’t comment further.\n\nThe interactions between Meta’s chief executive and the former President are notable given the history between the two men. Meta banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram for two years, saying his posts could lead to violence after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots in DC. Trump, meanwhile, has called Facebook the “enemy of the people” and insinuated that he would try and jail Zuckerberg if he is elected President again for being an “Election Fraudster.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon's (AMZN) stock fell 8% in afternoon trading Friday after the retail and cloud giant offered a current quarter forecast on Thursday that fell short of expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe disappointing returns were amplified by a weak July jobs report, which sent the tech world and the broader market deep into the red.\n\nFor the third quarter, Amazon guided sales to a range of $154 billion-$158.5 billion compared to analyst forecasts for $158.43 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Its operating income in the third quarter is set to fall within a range of $11.5 billion-$15 billion. Wall Street had expected operating income to come in closer to $15.2 billion.\n\nThe report wrapped a wave of Big Tech results that have flashed warnings that investors have limited patience for massive AI spending. Any weakness in the core business has heightened the scrutiny on Wall Street.\n\nEven as Amazon brought home earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26, beating estimates of $1.04 and nearly doubling profits from the same period last year, investors focused instead on the report's weaknesses.\n\nAmazon generated revenue of $148 billion, a touch below the $148.8 billion that analysts expected, but even the slight miss failed to impress.\n\nThe company's booming advertising segment, which has routinely grown by double-digit percentages, continued to show strength, but that segment too came in just below expectations, registering $12.8 billion in revenue versus the $13 billion expected.\n\nA bright spot of the report came from its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. AWS raked in $26.3 billion in revenue compared to the $26 billion expected and well above the $22.1 billion during the same time last year.\n\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call after earnings that AWS is poised to generate more than $105 billion annually.\n\nLike several of its peers, Amazon is investing heavily in infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of new AI technologies and cloud services.\n\nOlsavsky said the company has spent just over $30 billion in the first half of the year on capital expenditures, owing to the growing need for AWS services, including demand for generative AI tools. Amazon expects those investments to increase for the second half of the year, he said.\n\nOn the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition from the likes of Temu and Shein, companies that specialize in low-cost goods that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a discount digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We are seeing cautious consumers,\" Olsavsky said. \"They are looking for deals.” Amazon's DAX7 delivery station during Amazon's annual Prime Day event in South Gate, Calif. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Amazon’s topline growth came in short on softer consumer spending in a quarter sandwiched between two major sales events — the Big Spring Sale in March and Prime Day in July,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Sky Canaves in a statement.\n\n\"Amazon will have to position its offerings and promotions to take advantage of these trends, such as with the reported plans to launch a Temu-like discount section in time for the holidays this year,\" Canaves said.\n\nAmazon's report arrived days after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted lower-than-expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors running.\n\nMeta (META), on the other hand, earned the applause of Wall Street, delivering better-than-expected results for revenue and profit, even as executives warned they anticipate \"significant\" capital expenditures in 2025. Shares gained more than 4% Thursday.\n\nApple (AAPL) reported earnings alongside Amazon after the closing bell, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines despite a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Revenge Of The Rest: These Three S&P 493 Stocks Are Set To Pop\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nU.S. equities have been dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" accounting for the majority of the gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The highly esteemed group comprises seven of the largest companies in the U.S.: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese tech titans make up about a third of the index’s total value, overshadowing the performance of the other 493 companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has gained over 37% year-to-date, overshadowing the broader index's 15.8% returns over this period.\n\nCheck It Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding the potential overvaluation of the tech heavyweights have been racking investors, causing the S&P 500 index to decline by nearly 30 basis points over the past month.\n\nNonetheless, analysts are bullish on the remaining 493 stocks in the index.\n\n“So we’re seeing a diverging trend between the Magnificent Seven and the [S&P] 493 happening this quarter. The other 493 were basically in an earnings recession up until last quarter. We expect this earnings season is going to be the first quarter for the other 493 to post positive earnings growth since Q4 of ’22, whereas the Mag 7, their earnings growth is expected to decelerate for the second straight quarter and again in Q3. And by Q4 of this year consensus points to basically similar growth rates between the two and I think that will really be the catalyst for the rotation in the market to take place,” said Ohsung Kwon, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Securities.\n\nAmong the S&P 493, several dividend stocks stand out as potential winners in this expected market rotation.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has been steadily investing in its 5G network. The company added 391,000 total broadband connections in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband additions. Verizon's total broadband subscribers stood at 11.5 million as of the end of the second quarter, reflecting a 17.2% rise from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon pays $2.66 in dividends annually, yielding 6.64% on the current price. The company is currently on track to becoming a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years as of 2023.\n\n\"Our consistently disciplined approach to driving strong cash flow, operating the business, and serving our customers has once again put the Board in a position to raise the dividend,\" Verizon's Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a news release, \"We continue to deliver value to our shareholders as we execute our network-as-a-service strategy.\"\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation’s 1%.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to understand the art market dynamics.\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading pharmacy chain, had been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat until earlier this year when it slashed its quarterly dividend payouts by 48% to 25 cents per share. The company currently pays $1 per share in dividends annually, yielding 8.22% on the current price.\n\nBefore the dividend cut in January 2024, Walgreens was on track to becoming a Dividend King, having raised its dividends for 47 consecutive years.\n\nHowever, the company has been focusing on bolstering its growth prospects by expanding its health care services, including partnerships with primary care providers and investments in digital health initiatives.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to reduce our quarterly dividend payment to 25 cents per share, to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position. This action reinforces our goal of increasing cash flow while freeing up capital to invest in sustainable growth initiatives in our pharmacy and health care businesses, which we believe will ultimately improve shareholder value,\" said Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, in a news release.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical giant, has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 with its vaccine development. As of December 2023, Pfizer currently pays $1.68 in dividends annually, yielding 5.35% on the current price. The company has increased its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nHowever, as COVID-19-related growth subsides, Pfizer's earnings have been declining. The company's net income amounted to $2.33 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 98% decline year-over-year. This comes as the pandemic-driven momentum wanes, causing Pfizer's profit margins to dwindle.\n\nNonetheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise in the near term at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip",
        "content": "When it comes to the Magnificent Seven and big tech stocks, one of the ones I like the least is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as I find its business model less appealing and a little more fragile when compared to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nEven so, it is undeniable that the Google parent company has its moats and an excellent operational track record.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nAs the company is far from bad, I believe this recent dip makes the stock even more attractive, which, if it maintains its prospects of growing by double digits a year, is very cheap.\n\nIs the business model threatened?\n\nLooking at the forward price-earnings of the main Magnificent Seven companies, it is clear Alphabet stands out as the one with the lowest indicator. While the search machine is trading at 21 times its next 12 months' earnings, companies like Microsoft and Apple are already over 30, not to mention Amazon and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which add further distortion to this comparison. Even Meta (NASDAQ:META), which in recent history had the lowest multiples, has overtaken the tech giant.\n\nNote that although Alphabet has never stood out as a company that is traded with a rich multiple, in many periods it was much closer to the other companies, and only in recent months has this gap opened up. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nGOOGL Data by GuruFocus\n\nOf course, there is a reason for this. Even though the market often acts in a dysfunctional way, this would hardly happen without a plausible justification, especially for one of the world's largest companies. The main reason for the stock trading at this level, while maintaining an expectation of double-digit sales growth, is the threat to its main business, Google Search.\n\nIn the second quarter, the search tool accounted for 57% of the group's revenue, while other initiatives such as YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud were closer to 10% each. Even with this dependence, credit must be given to Alphabet, which over the years has built up a complete and diversified business model. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nAccording to some bears, Google's search model could be disrupted or slowed down by large language models. Today, the most common thing when you want to go to a restaurant or have a question is to go to the search engine and type it in. One of the narratives suggests this could easily be replaced by a question to your chatbot, be it GPT Chat, Alexa or Siri. If, instead of searching, many people start using these other methods, search becomes less relevant and directly impacts the company's revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy take tends toward skepticism. However long it takes for this narrative to materialize, instead of completely disrupting Google Search, it may only be something that will add obstacles, reducing growth rather than bringing about a stagnation or decrease in this line of revenue in the short and medium term. Artificial intelliegence will gradually become more popular, but to reach a considerable mass of the population that adopts it in their daily lives and replaces their habits of using Google search as a tool could take years.\n\nAs Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, even if this happens gradually, the company will be able to balance it with growth at other ends, whether in the cloud, through YouTube or a new line of revenue with Gemini. There is a range of options that bring an interesting vision and can help sustain this growth in the long run.\n\nStick with the fundamentals\n\nIn many cases, investors tend to turn something simple into something complex. While this can sometimes be necessary, especially in technology segments that are very dynamic and the outlook changes all the time, overcomplicating something and getting carried away with the narrative is a very common mistake.\n\nTrying to look at it pragmatically, in a stick with the fundamentals analysis, Alphabet is still an excellent company. In the breakdown of revenue, you can see that search revenue and Google Play advanced by 14% year over year, YouTube by 13% and Google Cloud by 29%. Alphabet is far from a dying business. Even with this growth, the miss in YouTube ad revenue disappointed the market, which together with the higher capital expenditures, caused the stock to fall post-earnings.\n\nBut it does not stop there. As well as having a growth rank of 10 on the GF Score, its profitability rank is also solid at 10. Its financial strength is also very good with cash on hand of over $100 billion. In terms of profitability, it is worth highlighting a net margin of 26.70% as well as a return on invested capital of 32.50%, which shows a cash cow business model and assertive capital allocation. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nHow about the future?\n\nAlphabet's capital allocation is very good as it has robust cash on hand, which could eventually turn into another successful acquisition like YouTube, or reinvestment in the business that is transformed to at least remain relevant in industries like search, AI and cloud. In the second quarter, the company made capital expenditures of more than $13 billion to cope with a robust infrastructure that supports the advancement of Google Cloud, Google Search and other businesses through data centers, but it put pressure on free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a risk that search will be affected, this is not a trend that seems likely to occur in the medium term. As already mentioned, this depends on the mass replacement and adoption of a new tool by the population. In the short and medium term, this technological evolution could bring greater assertiveness to ads and searches, boosting this market as a positive trend.\n\nWhen it comes to competition, although Google has recently lost ground to Bing (Microsoft's search engine), Alphabet still has a virtual monopoly, with more than 80% of the search market according to Statista. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: Statista\n\nIn this way, the future for search is partly cloudy, but it does not seem so uncertain that it can be labeled a dying business.\n\nEverything has a price\n\nIn addition to the multiples, which became even more attractive after the recent dip, other methods reinforce that Alphabet's stock is at a level that will remunerate shareholders well. If we run a reverse discounted cash flow model using earnings per share, projecting growth of 15% per year for the next 10 years and 10% for the following decade, we find the current share price by discounting at a rate of 12%. In other words, if the company manages to achieve greater growth than this, the annual return for the shareholder would be above 12%, making the stock a real compounder.\n\nThis becomes even more interesting when we look at the last five years, where the earnings per share compound annual growth rate has been 25.90%. Although the company does not need to maintain this level consistently, it is possible that positive surprises could happen along the way so that EPS growth could exceed the projected 10% to 15% per year. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nIf we use more reasonable assumptions to try to find a fair price, it is still possible to find an interesting upside. With 18% in the first 10 years and 8% in the last 10, discounting by 11% (still a high and restrictive figure for a company of such quality), we would have a fair value of $212 per share, equivalent to an upside of 21%. I used EPS instead of free cash flow because of the recent history of high capex, which would negatively bias the reverse DCF model.\n\nAccording to the GF Value Line, the stock should be worth around $155, which currently qualifies it as fairly valued, showing that although Alphabet is much cheaper than its tech peers, it's still not a huge bargain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAlphabet still has relevant moats and is not a dying business. For this reason, even though there is a certain cloudiness to some parts of its business model, the discrepancy between the premium for companies like Apple and Microsoft seems to have become very large, while there is a discount on the Google parent's shares that makes it more attractive, especially after this dip.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere’s a spending frenzy around AI, and this earnings season we’ve been getting more details on the pace of that outlay.\n\nMeta raised its capital expenditures forecast to the range of $37 billion to $40 billion. Microsoft spent $19 billion last quarter, including server farm leases. Amazon spent $30 billion so far this year and says it’ll kick it up a notch to close out 2024. Apple may be zagging, but clearly has a fresh AI focus of its own.\n\nWe’ve been told that generative AI is the next smartphone, the next internet — a transformational technology. That’s why these companies have ramped up spending in a generative AI-building arms race.\n\nThey’re spending because they believe in it, of course.\n\nBut is the spending also influencing that belief? Are the stakes now so high that even if the promise of generative AI doesn’t meet those lofty expectations, these companies, and their clients, will try to shoehorn it into products and processes where it’s not really needed?\n\nHistory is littered with “transformational” technologies that didn’t quite make the grade.\n\nDigital assistants, for example, like Amazon’s Alexa. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a former senior employee as saying, “We worried we’ve hired 10,000 people and we’ve built a smart timer.” Apple was reportedly spending $1 billion annually to develop a supposedly industry-changing vehicle before abandoning that effort earlier this year.\n\nOf course, a moonshot effort like the car was a sideline to Apple’s main business and hardly a lottery ticket for the company. It seems more so for Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, even Tesla, which are putting AI front and center in their pitch to investors. They’re motivated to make it work.\n\nAnd make it work quickly. Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn called the infrastructure build a “cycle of competitive escalation” in a recent piece, positing that the hyperscalers would move much more slowly, and perhaps rationally, if not on each other’s heels.\n\nThe ensuing digestion period has already likely begun, if investors’ impatient reaction to Microsoft’s earnings is any indication. Meta, on the other hand, “continues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI,” wrote JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth in reaction to its numbers.\n\nAs he pointed out, “Management continues to expect Meta AI to become the most used AI assistant by the end of 2024, & open source Llama 3.1 should support a faster pace of innovation, better social/advertiser experiences, & cost benefits.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIs that transformational? Expect to continue to hear that it is, or will be. It has to — because they’re writing the checks.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "Nvidia Has Plunged 26% in 6 Weeks -- but History Suggests an 80% Drop May Be in Order",
        "content": "For nearly two years, Wall Street has been entrenched in a sensational bull market. In recent weeks, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh record-closing highs.\n\nWhile there are a number of catalysts responsible for pushing the broader market to new heights, including a resilient U.S. economy and better-than-expected operating results for Wall Street's most-influential businesses, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is firmly at the top of the list.\n\nWith AI, software and systems oversee tasks that would normally have been assigned to humans. What gives this technology such immense appeal -- the analysts at PwC estimate a $15.7 trillion boost from AI to the global economy by 2030 -- is the capacity for AI-driven software and systems to learn and evolve without human intervention. Machine learning gives AI utility in pretty much every sector and industry. Nvidia's stock has soared -- but the music may be about to stop. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen next-big-thing technologies come along, professional and everyday investors aren't shy about bidding up the valuations of the companies behind them. Without question, no company has benefited more from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nAt its peak, Nvidia's stock gained more than $3 trillion in market value\n\nBeginning in early 2023, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) became the preferred choice for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights have estimated that Nvidia accounted for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped to high-compute data centers last year.\n\nHaving a veritable monopoly on the hardware powering decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers is an enviable place to be. With demand for the company's chips easily outstripping their supply, Nvidia has had no trouble meaningfully increasing the price of its H100 GPUs and pumping up its adjusted gross margin.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia isn't sitting on its laurels when it comes to innovation. Even though its H100 GPU has clear compute advantages over its rivals, Nvidia is set to roll out its next-generation GPU platform, known as Blackwell, in the latter-half of this year. In June, CEO Jensen Huang also teased the potential of its Rubin architecture, which is slated to hit the market by 2026. It would appear that Nvidia has a blueprint to retain its compute advantage in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nThis textbook operating expansion allowed Nvidia's valuation to catapult from $360 billion, when the curtain opened in 2023, to a peak of almost $3.5 trillion on an intra-day basis on June 20. For a brief moment, Nvidia became the most-valuable publicly traded company in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen the music slowed...\n\nNvidia's stock has plunged 26% in six weeks and may be headed much lower\n\nSince peaking at $140.76 on an intra-day basis, shares of Nvidia have plunged by 26% to $103.73, as of the closing bell on July 30. In roughly six weeks, Wall Street's AI darling has shed in the neighborhood of $900 billion in market value, which is higher than the market cap of 493 out of the 500 companies that comprise the S&P 500.\n\nAlthough stocks don't move up or down in a straight line, history suggests that Nvidia may have a lot further to fall.\n\nOver the last three decades, Wall Street has entertained no shortage of perceived-to-be game-changing innovations, technologies, and trends. This includes the advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, legalized cannabis, augmented/virtual reality, the metaverse, and now artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough market leaders for every trend listed above enjoyed parabolic moves higher in the early going, the music and euphoria eventually stopped. While some of these innovations went on to be wildly successful for patient investors (the internet), others flopped and never recovered (3D printing and cannabis).\n\nThe key point here is that all new technologies, trends, and innovations need to time to mature. While a $15.7 trillion addressable market probably sounds great on paper, the reality right now is that a majority of businesses lack a game plan for how they'll utilize AI to generate additional sales and grow their profits.\n\nThe one constant for next-big-thing innovations is an overestimation of uptake, adoption, and utility by the investing community -- and this includes Wall Street analysts and institutions. Every last trend I mentioned above endured a bubble-bursting event in its early stages, and there's nothing to suggest that AI won't follow suit.\n\nMarket-leading businesses tied to the advent of the internet, business-to-business commerce, genome decoding, cannabis, and cryptocurrency all plunged around 90%, or more, following the bursting of their respective bubbles. Meanwhile, the face of the metaverse, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), dipped by 80% before finding its nadir.\n\nMeta Platforms enjoyed a firmer foundation because it had its established social media assets to lean on in the event that the hype surrounding the metaverse disappeared. Meta generates approximately 98% of its revenue from advertising, and no social sites draw anywhere close to the number of daily active users that it can.\n\nNvidia offers similarities in that it has an established GPU businesses for data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency miners, along with virtualization software and automotive/robotics solutions. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, these established segments should keep Nvidia's stock from experiencing a decline of 90% or more, as we witnessed with other next-big-thing innovations.\n\nNevertheless, history is quite clear that bubble-bursting events are unkind to market leaders behind next-big-thing trends. A decline of 80% for Nvidia isn't just a possibility -- it's the expectation given what history tell us. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHeadwinds are mounting for Wall Street's AI darling\n\nTo make matters worse, history isn't the only headwind Wall Street's AI darling is contending with.\n\nBeginning in the second half of this year, Intel is expected to roll out its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerating chip on a wide-scale basis. This coincides with Advanced Micro Devices continuing to up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is considerably cheaper than the H100 on a cost basis. Even if Intel's and AMD's chips remain inferior, in terms of compute capabilities, Nvidia's inability to meet overwhelming enterprise demand will open the door for Intel and AMD to fill the void.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are internally developing AI chips for their respective data centers. Though it's unlikely these GPUs are going to outperform Nvidia's, they're notably cheaper than Nvidia's chips and will be taking up valuable data center \"real estate\" in the coming months, quarters, and years. The implication being that Nvidia's GPU sales to America's most-influential businesses have peaked.\n\nWe're already seeing evidence that Nvidia's market share dominance is set to wane. After reporting an adjusted gross margin of 78.35% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), the company guided to an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter. Even though Nvidia's margins have meaningfully expanded over the last 18 months, the first (forecast) sequential decline since 2022 suggests that the AI scarcity responsible for pushing GPU prices higher is about to dwindle.\n\nIt could be just a matter of time before Nvidia loses its trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) reported earnings Wednesday after the close beating analysts’ estimate and displaying continued strong growth for both the top and bottom line. Revenues grew 22% YoY, total daily active users (DAUs) grew 7% YoY to 3.27 billion, and the company repurchased $26 billion of shares.\n\nThere is a lot to like about META stock including impressive growth, strong stock price momentum, a relatively discounted valuation and further long-term tailwinds from AI integrations.\n\nCompared to the other members of the Magnificent 7, as well as many other stocks in the market, I believe Meta Platforms remains a stock to consider buying.\n\nMeta Beats Earnings Estimates and the Stock Advances\n\nWe saw earnings over the past week from fellow Magnificent 7 members Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), where the reception from wall street was not quite so ebullient. Although both Microsoft and Alphabet reported broadly strong earnings results, investors were critical of excessive capex spending on AI, which they fear will show little actual profit.\n\nBut Meta on the other hand appeared to show a more cohesive long-term plan for its AI integrations than Microsoft and Alphabet at the recent earnings meeting.\n\nOn the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerburg shared a litany of exciting and real uses for AI on its platforms, but one in particular really stood out to me. He noted that they were going to be using AI to empower advertisers by evolving from targeting specific audiences to generating personalized creative content. Previously, advertisers targeted specific demographics, but AI can now predict interested users more accurately.\n\nAI will generate and personalize ad content based on business objectives and budgets provided by advertisers, automating the entire process incrementally. This seems like a huge deal to me.\n\nMeta Platforms stock is up 4% on the day as of this writing while the broad market averages are down 2-3%.\n\nMeta Stock Remains a Huge Market Outperformer\n\nMeta Platforms has been a steady outperformer this year as well as over the last two-, five- and 10-year period. This year the stock is up 57% YTD and over the last decade it has appreciated at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%, almost double the S&P 500’s 11.6% CAGR. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTechnical Momentum Pattern Building in Meta Shares\n\nSpeaking of strong relative performance, the price action in META is also forming a bullish technical pattern. As of now, we see a very clear and simple bull flag which we can use to make a trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, the price is sitting right in the middle of the consolidation and although I am mostly bullish, am open-minded to anything happening. So, if the stock breaks below the level of support at $450 it may be worth waiting for another opportunity.\n\nBut if the stock can break out above the $540 level of resistance, it would signal a technical breakout and likely draw in more buyers sending the stock higher. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMETA Shares Trade at a Historical Discount\n\nEven with the tremendous stock price appreciation META has experienced, the stock still boasts a very fair valuation thanks to the equally strong growth in earnings.\n\nMETA is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.5x, which is below its 10-year median of 25.2 and just above the market average. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Meta Stock Now?\n\nI really believe that Meta Platforms is one of the most appealing mega cap tech stocks in the group and more broadly among the whole market. It is still growing rapidly even at its mammoth size, is quick to iterate new trends and returns heaps of cash to shareholders.\n\nFinally, I find that Mark Zuckerberg appears to be the most laser focused and committed CEO of the mega Cap tech stocks as he is the only founder to remain at the helm. He has dealt with blunders in the recent past like his Metaverse investments and continues to learn from mistakes and roll with the punches.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This week the tech giant revealed capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30.\n\nMicrosoft said it expects to increase its infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025 more than it did in 2024.\n\n\"The fear of potentially some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so — I think is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\n\nSocial media giant Meta, which accounts for roughly 10% of Nvidia's revenue, per Bloomberg data, said it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025 after posting strong results on Wednesday.\n\nChip peers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI), also sank on Thursday in a reversal from the prior session. Semiconductor stocks fell on Thursday, erasing gains from the prior session.\n\nThe semiconductor sector as a whole has benefited from the AI frenzy, but Nvidia is seen as the main beneficiary, up roughly 130% year to date. Rival AMD is down roughly 9% since the start of 2024.\n\n\"Over time, the pie will get bigger. I still think that Nvidia will have most of the slices, and AMD ... they’ll be a good second supplier. But NVDIA will have a hold on this market for as far as the eye can see,\" said Meeks.\n\nOn Wednesday Morgan Stanley's analysts led by Joseph Moore placed Nvidia on their 'Top Pick' list after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia — spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries — but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\n\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\n\nNvidia is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Mark Cuban And Other Venture Capitalists Pledge Support For Kamala Harris, Who's On The List?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMany venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and beyond believe that Vice President Kamala Harris could be a tech-friendly president. Some, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, have already endorsed the Vice President, but now a new pledge is attracting more support. The names on it represent some of the most important and well-funded tech funds.\n\nWhile Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban are at the top of the list, the VCsforKamala website shows over 100 venture capitalists signed up, including Chris Sacca, who has been a guest shark on Cuban's show \"Shark Tank.\" The VCsforKamala initiative was created by Seattle venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig. The site defines those on the list as venture capital investors, founders, and tech leaders pledging their support for Harris. They describe themselves as pro-business, pro-American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro-technological progress. So far, the list has over 110 signatories representing approximately $150 billion in venture capital.\r\n\r\nDon't Miss Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nOne prestigious name on the list is Ron Conway, the head of SV Angel. Conway has been a venture investor since the 1990s. He was also a co-founder of Altos Computer Systems, taking the company public in 1982. SV Angel has invested in Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Asana (NYSE:ASAN), Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and dozens of other private and public companies.\n\nAlso on the list is Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures. He is a longtime entrepreneur and the founding CEO of Sun Microsystems. He formed Khosla Ventures in 2004 and searches for attractive for-profit and social impact companies. Some of the companies that Khosla Ventures invested in and exited include Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST).\n\nAnother legend in the venture capital world who has signed his name is Brook Byers, a founder at Kleiner Perkins. Byers has been a venture capitalist since 1972, helping to build more than 60 companies. Kleiner Perkins has an alum list that spans some of the most successful companies of all time, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER).\n\nThere are many more investors on the list from large and small venture capital firms based not just in Silicon Valley but in cities all around the country. However, not everyone on the list has committed a large amount of campaign financing.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nNot all venture capitalists are on Harris' side of the aisle. Elon Musk has famously endorsed Trump. His fellow PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) alum Peter Thiel is reportedly on the fence, but Trump's selection of J.D. Vance has made him feel more sanguine about Trump. Other major investors who have declared for Trump include Bill Ackman of Pershing Square and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital, who donated $300,000 to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe founders of one of the world’s most prominent venture capital funds, Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, have endorsed former President Donald Trump. Andreessen Horowitz has been famously bullish on cryptocurrency and has backed many of Silicon Valley's biggest successes, including Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), as well as Meta, Airbnb, and others.\n\nAs we approach election day, we will likely see more tech luminaries on both sides. Those who favor Harris believe that she will be an ally to large tech companies because of her connections in California. Those who favor Trump believe that he could bring with him a new wave of deregulation that could benefit multiple industries.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Meta’s AI spending spree is just fine with Wall Street",
        "content": "Remember Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s infamous corporate belt-tightening of 2022 and 2023 when he preached “efficiency” and cut thousands of jobs? These days, it’s just a memory, as the company is currently on an AI spending spree. Wall Street seems just fine with that—at least for now—as Meta beat its Q2 earnings expectations with strong digital ad revenue, and the company’s stock is up about 4% today.\n\nMeta’s eye-popping AI spending is mostly going towards the infrastructure that supports training and running AI models—such as servers, data centers, and a reported 600,000 Nvidia GPUs (which each cost roughly $30,000 each). It all adds up to the tune of $37 billion to $40 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures, while the company said infrastructure spending “will be a significant driver of expense growth next year” as well.\n\nZuckerberg focused some of his earnings call comments on explaining why this AI infrastructure shopping binge will pay off with increased revenue from the company’s various apps, new AI experiences, and shaping its continued work on the metaverse.\n\nThe bottom line? Training more and more advanced AI models is expensive: Zuckerberg pointed out that while Meta’s newly released Llama 3 model is “already competitive with the most advanced models,” the company is already starting to work on Llama 4, which means planning for the computing power it will need going forward.\n\n“The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3—and future models will continue to grow beyond that,” said Zuckerberg on the earnings call. “It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects.”\n\nNot surprisingly, there were no comments given or questions asked by Wall Street analysts during the earnings call about the environmental impact of Meta’s AI infrastructure efforts. But there was plenty to discuss about the potential ROI of AI investments. Zuckerberg said that improving existing Meta products with AI would drive the most results in the short-term—over the next two years. “I think there’s a lot of upside” to improving recommendations and advertising experiences, he explained.\n\nBut he warned that making money on new-gen AI products—like Meta AI, the AI chatbot available on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp —will take a lot longer.\n\n“We have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches a billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale,” he said. When it comes to products like Meta AI or AI Studio, the company’s new make-your-own AI chatbot offering which rolled out this week on Instagram, he added, “I don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years, right?”\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, Wall Street has recently worried about the massive AI spending of other Big Tech firms and how long it would take for those investments to pay off, including at Microsoft, whose stock dropped after a narrow cloud earnings miss this week.\n\nBut for now, it seems like as long as its AI-driven digital ad revenues stay strong—and keep in mind, the artificial intelligence used for Meta’s ad business uses the same traditional machine learning techniques they have used for years, not generative AI models—investors will remain patient, even as they wait for the potential future profits to roll in from the promise of gen AI.\n\nSharon Goldman\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

The banks were among the biggest fallers among the FTSE 100, which fell 1pc.\n\nLower rates could weigh on interest margins, a key source of income for lenders.\n\nThe pessimism towards banks was also felt in continental Europe. Share prices across the European banking sector dropped 4.5pc.\n\nThe losses were fuelled by French banking giant Societe Generale, which tumbled almost 9pc after it cut its guidance for income from French retail lending.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoney markets are betting on at least two euro zone rate cuts by the end of the year. They are also currently pricing in another UK rate cut and possibly a third by December.\n\nUK interest rates had remained at 5.25pc for nearly a year - their highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008 - in a bid to tackle surging inflation.\n\nThe pace of price rises hit a 41-year high of 11.1pc in October 2022 but it has been brought back down to the Bank of England’s 2pc target, where it has stood for the last two months.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:11 PM BST\n\nInvestors await Amazon and Apple results\n\nThanks for joining us this afternoon.

The Big Tech firms have pushed Wall Street to record highs this year, on AI euphoria and hopes of early rate cuts.\n\nBut their momentum turned last month on worries investors had sent their share prices too high and expectations had grown too difficult.\n\nSome of the concern has centered around how much companies are investing in AI, and how quickly they will see profits because of it.\n\n06:04 PM BST\n\nWall Street drops on slowdown fears\n\nWall Street’s main indexes slumped this afternoon on renewed fears of a slowdown in the US economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nFresh data showed that America’s manufacturing output shrunk to an eight-month low in July, dragging industrial stocks down 2pc.

Christopher Jasper reports:\n\nWizz – a major rival to Michael O’Leary’s Ryanair – became the latest European airline to reveal lacklustre results on Wednesday, with profits almost wiped out in the three months through June, sending the stock to its biggest decline since the start of Covid lockdowns in March 2020.\n\nJózsef Váradi, Wizz chief executive, said sluggish sales in the UK and Western Europe will lead the airline to reassess where it stations new jets next summer. Deployment is likely to be skewed more to Central and Eastern Europe, where demand remains robust.\n\nBritain, where Wizz competes with carriers including Ryanair, easyJet and Jet2 in the intensely competitive low-cost market, may get some additional flight times and perhaps a few more routes, he said, but is unlikely to benefit from the opening of further bases.\n\nThe company has its biggest British hub at Luton, where it stations 11 planes, with a smaller one at Gatwick that is home to five. Bases in Cardiff and at Doncaster Sheffield Airport were opened after the pandemic but have since closed.\n\nWizz also serves Birmingham, Leeds Bradford, Glasgow and Aberdeen airports with aircraft based elsewhere.\n\nRead the full story...

They had soared last month on hopes that the economy would remain solid even as interest rates come down.\n\n03:42 PM BST\n\nInterest rates should be cut to 4pc by early 2025, says economist\n\nInterest rates should be cut by a full percentage point by early next year, a leading economist has said.\n\nJulian Jessop, of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs, said:\n\nThe aim should now be to return rates to a neutral level of around 4% by early next year.\n\nThe Bank’s own economic forecasts point the way. Inflation is expected to pick up temporarily in the second half of this year, but then fall back to 1.7pc in two years and to 1.5pc in three years, even based on market expectations of further rate cuts.\n\nThe economy has been a little stronger than expected, but this is partly based on hopes that falling inflation will be followed by falling rates. The Bank needed to deliver in order to sustain the recovery.\n\nEven at 5pc, interest rates are still high and will therefore continue to bear down on inflation, especially as the Bank is persisting with “quantitative tightening” as well.\n\nThere are still some reasonable concerns about services inflation. But with overall inflation still forecast to fall below the MPC’s 2pc target over the medium term, leaving rates on hold would have been more damaging for credibility than a small cut.

The billionaire investor owns a stake in a major gas pipeline from Russia to Europe.\n\nGovernment officials could block a deal or ask for specific commitments from the suitor if the review raises major concerns.\n\nThe review process is expected to take up to two months.\n\nSources close to the process said calling in the deal under the NSI act was “not a surprise” given the significance of Royal Mail. The Government undertook a similar review when Mr Kretinsky increased his shareholding in Royal Mail’s owner to 27.5pc in 2022.\n\nLast week, Labour’s Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated the new Government was likely to call in the takeover, stressing that we would speak with Mr Kretinsky directly.\n\nLabour’s General Election manifesto pledged that it would “ensure that any proposed takeover is robustly scrutinised”.\n\nMr Kretinsky has vowed to maintain Royal Mail’s requirement to deliver letters six days a week throughout the UK, known as its Universal Service Obligation. He has also pledged to protect the company’s investment grade credit rating.

On the whole I think private sector pay tends to lead public sector pay and that’s what we’ve been seeing, actually.\n\nWe’ll get the full story with the Budget, obviously, because we haven’t got the full story yet because obviously we don’t know how this is going to be funded, the Chancellor’s got decisions to make on that front.\n\nHe later added:\n\nWe look primarily at private sector wages. We think public sector wages play a role but they are not a direct input into inflation measures.\n\nIf you get the back of your envelope out, you have got to think about what the increment to public sector wages would be relative to what was expected and calibrate what you think the inflation impact of that will be.\n\nWe will know a lot more about that when we have the Budget but if you do a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation it is not that large.\n\n01:34 PM BST\n\nBank of England ‘softening blow’ of tax rises, say Telegraph readers\n\nHere is a selection of some of the best comments from your fellow readers following the Bank of England’s decision to cut interest rates:\n\n01:23 PM BST\n\nInflation expectations have shifted, Bailey tells mortgage borrowers\n\nAsked what borrowers should do if they are about to remortgage their home, Andrew Bailey said:\n\nIf you look at the path of mortgage rates, they are now over 1pc lower than where they were this time last year.\n\nWhat that tells us is expectations of where inflation is going to go to have shifted.\n\nInflation has come down more rapidly than I think all of us feared this time last year in terms of the global shocks working their way through, and that is obviously good news.\n\nIf you look at it more immediately, mortgage rates have come down but part of that fall over a year has happened in recent weeks, actually.\n\nThese days, with most mortgages being fixed rate over some period of time they are actually essentially priced off the swap curve in financial markets so they reflect what financial markets think is going to happen to rates and we have seen some easing off in the last few weeks are so.\n\n01:09 PM BST\n\nWe must stay ‘highly alert’ to inflation risks, says Bailey\n\nBank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said policymakers will remain “highly alert” to signs that inflation might increase, despite cutting the base rate to 5pc on Thursday.\n\nMr Bailey said the UK has “truly come a long way in returning inflation to target”, but that some indicators like persistent services price inflation remain a risk factor.\n\nHe said: “We need to watch this very carefully. The Monetary Policy Committee continues to pay close attention to services inflation as an indicator of persistence in domestic inflationary pressures, along with a range of other economic indicators.”\n\nHe added: “The committee continues to remain highly alert to the risks of inflation persistence and will decide the appropriate degree of monetary policy restrictiveness at each meeting.”\n\n01:07 PM BST\n\nBailey: We have to wait until Budget to work out impact of pay rises\n\nOur economics editor Szu Ping Chan asked Andrew Bailey about Rishi Sunak’s concern that “Labour’s inflation-busting public sector pay rises” have put further interest rate cuts.\n\nMr Bailey said:\n\nThe next step in this process now is the Budget on October 30 because what we had this week was a statement but it needs to be fully filled in.\n\nWe will wait for that news and then we can fully process that, as we always do as ‘announced government policy’, and see where it comes out.\n\nSzu also asked the Governor whether there is a sense among businesses that they are reaching the limit of what they can absorb on the minimum wage. He said:\n\nOn the national minimum wage... when I go around the country the national living wage does get raised quite a lot.\n\nWe spend quite a lot of time looking at it and... if you go back to the May forecast, pay has pretty much evolved exactly as we thought it would back in May.\n\nWe haven’t had any surprises on that front. It is coming down quite gradually but it is coming down.\n\nSo what I take from that is the effects of the national living wage that we built in at that point have not been contradicted by bad news on the upside.\n\n01:04 PM BST\n\nSunak: Labour’s inflation-busting public sector pay rises have put further cuts at risk\n\nThe former prime minister has raised concerns about the likelihood of future interest rate cuts by the Bank of England.\n\nThe @bankofengland has cut interest rates for the first time since 2020.\r\n\r\nThat's good news for homeowners and shows Labour inherited a strong economy.\r\n\r\nMy concern now is that Labour's inflation-busting public sector pay rises have put further cuts at risk.\n\n— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) August 1, 2024\n\n12:49 PM BST\n\nBailey says interest rate decisions will be made ‘meeting by meeting’\n\nAndrew Bailey insisted he was “not giving you any view on the path of rates to come” despite markets predicing there will be one more rate cut by the end of 2024.\n\nThe Governor said policymakers will go “meeting by meeting”, adding that “nothing has really changed much in terms of the economic news”.\n\nHe said that what had changed is that policymakers “have become more confident over time” that inflation is falling, adding “we have become sufficiently confident now to reduce” interest rates from 5.25pc to 5pc. Andrew Bailey announced interest rates have been cut from 5.25pc to 5pc - Alberto Pezzali/PA Wire\n\n12:46 PM BST\n\nBailey: Persistent inflation risk has ‘moderated’\n\nAndrew Bailey said it had become appropriate to “reduce the degree of restrictiveness a little” after inflation fell “markedly over the last year”.\n\nHe said that the “risks of persistently high inflation have moderated”.\n\n12:41 PM BST\n\nBailey: Decision to cut rates was ‘finely balanced’\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England has said that the decision to cut interest rates for the first time in four years was “finely-balanced”.\n\nAndrew Bailey said domestic price pressures are still “elevated” and said that services inflation - which is closely watched by policymakers - is expected to fall after picking up in August.\n\nWatch his press conference here:\n\n12:34 PM BST\n\nBank of England cut rates despite ‘mixed data’\n\nThe Bank of England had cut interest rates “despite mixed data” on the economy, according to economists.\n\nMany commentators had suggested policymakers might hold back amid signs that services inflation and wage growth remained persistent.\n\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said:\n\nThe run up to today’s announcement saw little communication from the MPC, even after the end of the election blackout in early July. The Bank likely wanted to ensure a degree of flexibility by allowing coming data and new forecasts to guide their decision.\n\nToday’s decision was accompanied by a new set of forecasts which saw the Bank upgrade its outlook for growth.\n\nDespite the recent persistence in underlying inflation, a slim majority of MPC members opted for easing, placing more weight on the new projections which show inflation returning to target in Q1 2026 and a further loosening in the labour market.\n\nThe language in the statement still leaves the door open for more easing in the second half of the year, and is broadly in line with our expectation of two further cuts.\n\nHowever, risks are skewed towards fewer cuts, particularly if progress on underlying inflation is insufficient over the coming months.\n\n12:31 PM BST\n\nUK stocks jump as Bank of England cuts interest rates\n\nUK stocks jumped after the Bank of England announced its first interest rate cut in four years.\n\nThe FTSE 250, which is focused on domestic companies, jumped 0.8pc higher as policymakers voted by a majority of five votes to four to reduce the Bank Rate from its 16-year high of 5.25pc to 5pc.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was 0.3pc higher while the pound dropped by 0.7pc against the dollar as traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again before the end of 2024.\n\n12:19 PM BST\n\nPound falls as Bank of England cuts interest rates\n\nThe pound has deepened its losses after the Bank of England cut interest rates for the first time in four years.\n\nSterling was down 0.7pc to $1.277 after the Monetary Policy Committee voted to reduce rates from 5.25pc to 5pc.\n\nThe pound has fallen 0.4pc against the euro, which is worth 84.5p.\n\n12:14 PM BST\n\nReeves says millions still facing higher mortgage rates\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said:\n\nWhile today’s cut in interest rates will be welcome news, millions of families are still facing higher mortgage rates after the mini-budget.\n\nThat is why this Government is taking the difficult decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy after years of low growth, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of our country better off.\n\n12:12 PM BST\n\nGovernor Bailey’s casting vote seals rate cut\n\nAndrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, Clare Lombardelli and Dave Ramsden voted in favour of cutting interest rates.\n\nMegan Greene, Jonathan Haskel, Catherine L Mann and Huw Pill voted to hold rates at 5.25pc.\n\nFascinating split on the MPC - not just 5-4 in the vote but also externals & internals split.

But we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much.\n\nEnsuring low and stable inflation is the best thing we can do to support economic growth and the prosperity of the country.\n\n12:02 PM BST\n\nPolicymakers split on rate cut\n\nRate setters on the Monetary Policy Committee were split on the decision to cut rates.\n\nThey only voted in favour by a majority of five to four.\n\n12:00 PM BST\n\nBank of England cuts interest rates to 5pc\n\nThe Bank of England has cut interest rates from a 16-year high of 5.25pc to 5pc.\n\n11:55 AM BST\n\nFTSE 100 edges higher ahead of interest rate decision\n\nWith minutes to go before the Bank of England announces its interest rate decision, here’s whats happening in the markets.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is up 0.1pc while the FTSE 250 is down 0.2pc.\n\nThe pound remains down 0.6pc as traders bet there is a 65pc chance that we are about to be told that the Bank Rate has been reduced for the first time in four years.\n\nThe UK’s 10-year bond yield has fallen four basis points to 3.93pc, while the two-year gilt yield is down four basis points to 3.74pc.\n\n11:47 AM BST\n\nInterest rate cut would be more ‘symbolic than substantial’, say analysts\n\nLaith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said today’s interest rate decision will be more “symbolic than substantial”.\n\nHe said:\n\nA rate cut marks an entry into a new phase of interest rate policy, but at street level the reality is financial conditions won’t change much.\n\nEspecially for the horde of people who will be rolling off cheap fixed-rate mortgages this year and encountering a new and bracing financial reality.\n\nSanjay Raja, senior economist for Deutsche Bank, predicted that rates will be cut to 5pc but stressed it will be a “delicate balance”.\n\nHe said Governor Andrew Bailey could be among the members on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opting for a rate cut.\n\n11:38 AM BST\n\nServices inflation and wage rises make rate cuts a ‘close call’\n\nThe Bank of England might hold back on cutting interest rates amid concerns about persistent services inflation and wage rises, according to economists.\n\nJames Smith, developed market economist for ING, said it will be a “close call” but he expects a majority of policymakers to vote in favour of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut.\n\nHe said services inflation - which looks only at service-related industries such as hospitality and culture - is the “guiding light for Bank of England policy right now”.\n\n“More recently, services inflation has been propped up by a spike in hotel prices,” he said, suggesting the Bank could be less concerned by the “highly volatile” data.\n\n“The bottom line is that there is just about enough in the recent data to give the Bank confidence to begin lowering rates,” Mr Smith concluded.\n\nAndrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at Oxford Economics, said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank could hold rates at 5.25pc for another month.\n\nHe said little hints among MPC members in recent weeks suggest they were thinking of voting for a cut, and were more likely to use the meeting to “lay the groundwork” for a 0.25 percentage point reduction in September.\n\n11:27 AM BST\n\nUS stocks poised to rise amid rate cut hopes\n\nWall Street stocks are expected to open higher after the US Federal Reserve signalled it will cut interest rates in September.\n\nFacebook-owner Meta soared 7pc in premarket trading after its second-quarter revenues were better than expected and it offered an upbeat third-quarter sales forecast.\n\nThe Facebook-owner’s quarterly results were the first among the “Magnificent Seven” group of companies to enthuse investors, allaying some concerns around AI spending following dismal earnings from Alphabet and Microsoft last month.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq scored their biggest one-day gains since February 22 on Wednesday after Fed chairman Jerome Powell suggested a likely pivot to policy easing in September.\n\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1pc, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 gained about 0.3pc.\n\n11:06 AM BST\n\nMortgage rates slashed ahead of Bank of England announcement\n\nHigh street lenders have dropped their mortgage rates ahead of an expected Bank Rate cut.\n\nOur senior money writer Fran Ivens has the latest:\n\nThe Bank of England has held interest rates at 5.25pc for a year, following 14 consecutive rises from December 2021 but is expected to make the first cut at midday on Thursday.\n\nHalifax announced cuts to its fixed mortgages, taking effect on Thursday, both for homeowners looking to remortgage and those purchasing a property.\n\nNatWest has also cut rates across its fixed mortgage range by up to 0.15 percentage points. The changes apply to both remortgage and purchasing loans.\n\nRead which other lenders are cutting rates in a bid to attract business over the summer.\n\n10:55 AM BST\n\nPound could still move higher longer term with rate cut, say analysts\n\nThe pound will fall in the short term if the Bank of England cuts interest rates but could still push higher in the long run, analysts have said.\n\nCharu Chanana, head of FX strategy at Saxo, said sterling could be boosted by Britain’s growing economy and political stability.\n\nAnnualised GDP growth for the first quarter has risen to 0.7pc, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2021 and higher than the Bank of England’s own forecast of 0.4pc, while second quarter growth indicators suggest that growth can overshoot Bank of England’s 0.2pc projection.\n\nMs Chanana said:\n\nWhile the balance of vote split remains vulnerable to a shift towards a rate cut, language will still likely remain hawkish given sustained services inflation pressures and a resilient economy.\n\nThe pound could face near-term downside if a rate cut comes through, but could retail its resilience against other G10 currencies as the BOE’s rate cut cycle could be less aggressive than its peers, and economic resilience and political calmness are also at play.\n\n10:36 AM BST\n\nPublic sector pay rises give Bank of England narrow window, says academic\n\nImpending public sector pay rises mean the Bank of England has a “very narrow window” to cut interest rates, according to an academic.\n\nProfessor Costas Milas of University of Liverpool said that policymakers will not have long before the £9.4bn pay settlement that will be made to public sector workers this year leads to a “wage-price spiral”.\n\nHe added that there is evidence that the Bank of England should cut rates now, despite persistent services inflation worrying policymakers.\n\nHe said:\n\nFresh research, just published in the very prestigious Journal of Monetary Economics (the “Bible” for all Central Bank policymakers) finds that monetary tightening in the US takes about 43 months to lower “services inflation” significantly.\n\nSo, if these results also carry over to the UK (where, for instance, “services inflation” remains high at 5.7pc), the natural implication is that the MPC should cut interest rates immediately and be patient, that is, not worry much about service-sector inflation.\n\n10:24 AM BST\n\nBarclays expects fewer interest rate cuts this year\n\nBarclays has slashed the number of UK interest rate cuts it expects this year, partly helping increase its forecast for income from interest in the first half of the year.\n\nOur reporters Michael Bow and Melissa Lawford have the latest:\n\nThe bank had originally pencilled in five cuts this year to 4pc but now assumes just one rate cut to 5pc for the rest of the year.\n\nIts full year guidance for net interest income, which reflects the difference between the amount paid out on customer deposits and earned on loans, was hiked to £11bn from £10.7bn previously due to the higher for longer rate environment in the UK.\n\nChief financial officer Anna Cross said the reduction reflected general consensus from economic markets and was not unique to Barclays.\n\nIt comes as the lender’s profits dropped as higher borrowing costs hit its income from mortgage lending and saw savers move cash to accounts offering better interest rates.\n\nThe high street lender’s profits before tax were £4.2bn in the first half of the year, down from £4.6bn in the first six months of 2023, according to its half year results.\n\nAlthough high interest rates typically boost banks’ profits, Barclays said its higher income was “more than offset my mortgage margin pressure and adverse product dynamics in deposits.”\n\nBarclays has reduced its total gross mortgage lending by nearly a quarter year-on-year, down from £12.2bn to £9.2bn in the first six months of 2024.\n\n10:12 AM BST\n\nGovernment borrowing costs fall ahead of interest rate decision\n\nThe cost of government borrowing has edged lower as traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates today.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts - the return the government promises to buyers of its debt - has fallen to 3.93pc, which is its lowest since April.\n\nBond markets are seen as an indicator of interest rate expectations.\n\nThe yield on two-year UK gilts - which is much more sensitive to interest rate changes - was down to 3.78pc, its lowest level since January.\n\nIt hit a high of 5.31pc in June last year as the Bank of England raised interest rates in an effort to bring down inflation.\n\n09:56 AM BST\n\nFactory output highest in two years despite Red Sea crisis\n\nThe UK’s manufacturing sector has seen activity jump to a two-year high in July, according to fresh data, although the Red Sea crisis continues to push up costs.\n\nThe closely watched S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey recorded a reading of 52.1 for July, up from from 50.9 in June and above the 51.8 indicated in last month’s “flash” estimate.\n\nThe sector has now remained above the 50 mark, separating growth from contraction, for the past three months.\n\nRob Dobson, director at S&P Global, said:\n\nUK manufacturing has started the second half of 2024 on an encouragingly solid footing. July saw growth of production and new orders strengthen and staffing levels rise for the first time since September 2022.\n\nHopes for an economic revival and reduced political uncertainty took confidence to one of its highest levels for two-and-a-half years, with 60pc of companies surveyed now forecasting output will rise over the coming 12 months.\n\nThere were also further signs that the trend in new export business is close to stabilising following a prolonged period of decline.\n\nInflationary pressures remain a blot on the copybook, however, with input costs rising to the greatest extent in one-and-a-half years.\n\nThe ongoing Red Sea crisis and associated freight issues are having a severe impact on prices which are then sustaining a focus on cost-caution and cash flow protection at manufacturers.\n\n09:39 AM BST\n\nPound slumps as traders bet on Bank of England interest rate cut\n\nThe pound has fallen as traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates for the first time in four years.\n\nSterling dropped 0.6pc against the dollar to $1.278, its lowest level since early July, ahead of the most eagerly-anticipated monetary policy decision in a year.\n\nTraders bet there is a 63pc chance that policymakers will cut interest rates from 5.25pc - where they have stood since August last year - to 5pc.\n\nThe Bank of England has not cut interest rates since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and increased borrowing costs to their highest level since the global financial crisis in 2008 in a bid to tackle surging inflation.\n\nThe pace of price rises hit a 41-year high of 11.1pc in October 2022 but it has been brought back down to the Bank of England’s 2pc target, where it has stood for the last two months.\n\nThe drop in the pound against the dollar comes despite the US Federal Reserve signalling that it could cut interest rates in September, after opting to hold rates at 5.25pc to 5.5pc, their highest level since 2001.\n\nSterling was down 0.2pc against the euro, which is worth 84.4p.\n\n09:25 AM BST\n\nEuropean stocks slump as carmakers hit the skids\n\nEuropean shares were opened lower amid a series of dour earnings reports, particularly from car makers.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 0.5pc, while the Cac 40 in Paris was down 1.3pc and the Dax in Frankfurt had fallen 1.1pc.\n\nThe car sector fell the most, following a 4.8pc slump in BMW after the German carmaker reporting lower-than-expected quarterly profit margins.\n\nVolkswagen, Europe’s top carmaker, fell 2.2pc after reporting a 2.4pc drop in its second-quarter operating profit, while Daimler Truck lost as much as 6.2pc.\n\nSociete Generale slumped 7.2pc after the French lender reported its second-quarter results.\n\nOn the flip side, Stella Artois maker Anhueser-Busch InBev rose as much as 3.6pc after the beer giant reported a forecast-beating core profit for the second quarter.\n\n09:13 AM BST\n\nBailey questioned over possible interest rate cut\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey was coy this morning when asked by a passing journalist if the Bank of England is going to cut interest rates today:\n\n\"Are you going to cut today?\" I ask Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey as he walks past me while I have my morning coffee\r\n\r\n\"Who knows,\" he says, chuckling pic.twitter.com/ZcBSFJYNlO\n\n— Conrad Quilty-Harper (@Coneee) August 1, 2024\n\n09:04 AM BST\n\nRolls-Royce shares hit record high as FTSE 100 remains flat\n\nThe FTSE 100 was flat despite a flurry of strong results as investors were cautious ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision.\n\nRolls-Royce shares surged to a record high but it was not enough to keep the blue-chip index in positive territory.

But the Bank of England has held firm, meaning the big question being asked both in the City and in millions of homes across the country is: when will interest rates go down?\n\nBritain’s official interest rate, set by the Bank of England, has been at 5.25pc since August 2023. It began to rise from its record low of just 0.1pc in late 2021 as the Bank attempted to curtail rising inflation.\n\nWhen the Bank Rate is high, it has a knock-on effect on mortgage and savings rates.

But the lifeblood of the business, free cash flow, actually increased marginally to $10.2bn.\n\nThat’s given management the confidence to plough another $3.5bn into buybacks, maintaining the quarterly run-rate.\n\nIt’s also supporting investment into Liquified Natural Gas projects in Abu Dhabi and Trinidad and Tobago, and the Atapu-2 deepwater project in Brazil. Meanwhile, it’s taken another chunk out of net debt which now stands at $38.3bn.\n\nMentions of new investments in new energy were conspicuous by their absence which may disappoint investors looking at Shell’s future beyond fossil fuels.\n\nThe pause on construction at its proposed biofuels facility in the Netherlands contributed to a $2bn impairment to the value of its assets.\n\nHowever, its carbon capture at the Scotford refinery in Canada may go some way to appease environmentalists.

        "content": "Meta (META) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) jumped 9.9% in the morning session after the company reported second quarter earnings results. Meta slightly beat analysts' revenue guidance expectations for the next quarter. In addition, this quarter's revenue and EPS narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects to continue investing in Reality Labs as its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are seeing strong traction. Overall, this quarter seemed fairly positive, and shareholders should feel optimistic. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $496.63, up 4.7% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nMeta's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 5 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT. Perhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\n\nMeta is up 43.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $496.63 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $539.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,575.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meta, Microsoft, and Google blew blinding amounts of AI smoke during earnings—here’s what we actually learned",
        "content": "The three giants of the AI valley have spoken. What have we learned?\n\nNot much — other than the fact that all three (Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta) see no limit to the amount of wealth they’re itching to pump into their AI projects.\n\nOver the course of three, hour-long earnings calls, the only hard numbers about AI that we heard this week related to capital expenditures. The Big Tech trio spent a combined $40.5 billion on the infrastructure, land, and chips that power their AI services during the second quarter. And each company indicated that those numbers will only get bigger next year.\n\nThe rest of the AI info that was served up – particularly anything related to the revenue side of the ledger – amounted to mostly empty rhetoric.\n\nLet’s start with Meta. On Wednesday CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was on track to have “the world’s most used AI assistant by the end of the year.”\n\nZuck didn’t provide much context to help listeners understand what this feat might mean. Is an AI assistant in the same category as a “copilot,” the generative AI tools that rival Microsoft is fervently pushing to its customers? Unclear.\n\nLet’s assume an “AI assistant” is a traditional chatbot, in the same class as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini. How does Meta AI stack up? Search around, and you’ll discover that even trying to make an apples-to-oranges comparison is not easy. Google said in May that \"over 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini Advanced in just three months\" and on its earnings call last week CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini is now used in \"all six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users\" — nice large numbers that don't really tell us anything. For its part, OpenAI said in May that “every week, more than a hundred million people use ChatGPT.”\n\nAll of this suggests that Meta, which now has 3.3 billion daily users across its family of apps, could theoretically declare victory if at year’s end there are 101 million people per week using the AI assistant that it has very conspicuously bolted on to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. The bar doesn't appear to be very high.\n\nAs for when these Meta AI users will lift the company’s top line, Zuckerberg takes a long-term view: Generative AI will not be a meaningful driver of the business for “years.\" Don't expect generative AI to move the needle next year, or even in 2026, Zuckerberg said — AI revenue in 2025 and 2026 will come from the traditional, behind-the-scenes AI tools that the company uses to improve feed recommendations and advertising, but not from Meta AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSatya Nadella had lots of impressive sounding but similarly hazy datapoints to share on the Microsoft earnings call, and he unleashed them in a rapid fire barrage. Azure AI customers increased by more than 60% year-over-year, with roughly 60,000 customers in total. Microsoft 365 copilot customers more than doubled year-over-year, with the majority of enterprise customers “coming back to purchase more seats.” There are 10,000 Microsoft 365 copilot enterprise seats, we learned, but it was left unspecified if those are all paid seats.\n\nThe closest Nadella came to dropping a hard number involved GitHub, and the AI “copilot” that helps computer programmers write code.\n\nGitHub’s annual revenue \"run rate\" is now $2 billion, Nadella said. Run rates are a slippery thing, of course – what is the $2 billion run rate extrapolated from: revenue rung up in the most recent quarter? Month? Day? Hour? Nadella didn’t say. But he noted that copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth this year (note that this revenue growth is not the same thing as the just-mentioned revenue run rate, so that $2 billion number is not relevant). He then said that GitHub copilot is already a larger business than the entirety of GitHub when Microsoft acquired the company back in 2018.\n\nThere’s no public number for GitHub’s revenue at the time of its acquisition, since it was a private company. But a New York Times article at the time cites analyst estimates that GitHub’s revenue was “running at $200 million a year.”\n\nSo there you have it, one somewhat solid datapoint about AI from the Big Tech earnings reports: GitHub copilot’s revenue is somewhere just north of $200 million a year, and very likely below $400 million (since Nadella would presumably have described the business as “more than twice the size” if that were the case, right?).\n\nWall Street analyst notes recapping the earnings are full of commentary about \"strong demand signals\" and promising AI uptake. And Meta's stock is riding high today, following Wednesday's earnings report, thanks to the enduring strength of its advertising business. But when you look closely at what we actually learned about generative AI, there's not much there there.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "M&amp;A Stock Picks: 3 Acquisition Targets to Buy Now",
        "content": "Fortune recently reported that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is up 17% worldwide through the first half of 2024. Of this activity, 90% of the largest deals so far year-to-date were U.S. targets. Almost half of the top 10 deals in 2024 were stock rather than cash payments. That makes sense given interest rates are higher and stock prices are relatively healthy. So, who are the acquisition targets to buy now?\n\nI’ve recommended three stocks that could be acquisition targets. For my criteria, at least one of the companies, acquirer or acquired, must be in the S&P 500. In addition, the targets must have market capitalizations that are significantly lower than the acquirers. Furthermore, these are speculative acquisitions and are not guaranteed to happen. Rather, this serves as a thought experiment of potential moves that could happen in the market.\n\nCelanese (CE) Cellphone with logo of US chemicals company Celanese Corporation (CE) on screen in front of business website Focus on center-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nCelanese (NYSE:CE) is the 83rd smallest company on the index with a market capitalization of $15.15 billion. CE stock is down over 10% YTD as I write this. Furthermore, Celanese is a global leader in the production of specialty materials and chemical products like acetic acid. It is the world’s largest producer of acetyl products, which are used in all kinds of high-value applications and products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts Q1 2024 sales were $2.61 billion, down 8.4 percent from $2.85 billion a year earlier. Its operating income for the quarter was $210 million, down  16.3% from $251 million a year earlier.\n\n“Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute in a commercial environment that has stabilized but still shows limited signs of meaningful recovery,” CEO Lori Ryerkerk said in its Q1 2024 press release.\n\nThe company’s stock is currently valued at 12.35x its forward 2024 earnings. Its price-to-sales ratio is 1.42x, less than the five-year average of 1.74x. With significant headwinds still facing its business, it might be a good time for a larger company such as Dow (NYSE:DOW) or DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD) to consider buying it.\n\nPinterest (PINS)\n\nPinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) is not part of the index. It has a market cap of $25.78 billion. PINS stock is up 4% YTD at the time of writing. I believe Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which is part of the index, would make an excellent buyer of Pinterest. Facebook doesn’t have the best reputation in social media, while Pinterest is generally considered the only platform that’s not about distributing misinformation.\n\nAs far as social media platforms go, Pinterest has a more creative niche and interactive design. From a financial standpoint, Meta could easily afford PINS as its free cash flow last quarter was $12.53 billion. In the trailing 12 months ended March 31, it was nearly $50 billion, more than enough to Pinterest on its list of acquisition targets.\n\nBut what could compel Meta to make the purchase? Pinterest’s reported Q2 2024 results on July 30 after the market close could give a reason. While its results beat on both the top and bottom lines, its shares fell in after-hours trading due to weak guidance.\n\nIts monthly average users (MAUs) in the second quarter were 522.0 million, 12% higher than Q2 2023, and 1.9 million higher than the analyst estimate. Its revenue increased 21% to $853.7 million, and its adjusted EBITDA was $179.9 million, 68% higher than a year ago. Beyond the market reaction, Pinterest’s monetization efforts are gaining traction.\n\nIn one acquisition Meta would gain an improved reputation and a more visually appealing social media platform for its 3.07 billion MAUs worldwide.\n\nE.L.F. Beauty (ELF)\n\nE.L.F. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is not in the index. It has a market cap of $9.40 billion. ELF stock is up 20% YTD as I write this and 44% over the past year. However, it’s down nearly 25% from its 52-week high of $221.83.\n\nThe buyer? Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), whose market cap is 3.7x ELF, has lost nearly half its value over the past year.\n\nIt needs some good news. Earlier this year, it announced it would lay off between 3-5% of its global labor force, cutting as many as 3,000 positions as part of the company’s restructuring that will result in restructuring charges of $500 million to $700 million. As a result, its operating profits should rise nearly 40% once complete, to more than $1.1 billion.\n\nCEO Fabrizio Freda has been in charge of the company since July 2009. In the top position for 15 years, he probably doesn’t want his legacy to be his cost-cutting. Buying ELF would give it some time to find more high-end products that its customers want while gaining a whole bunch of new ones.\n\nAnd it most likely would make the Lauder family, who control the company, much happier about his time spent as CEO.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meta Joins The AI Spending Spree But Shields Itself With Strong Ad Revenue And Earnings Beat\n\nOn Wednesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) surpassed Wall Street estimates with its second quarter results, as well as raised its guidance for the current quarter. During Wednesday’s extended trading, Meta shares made a 7% jump.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, revenue grew 22% YoY to $39.07 billion, exceeding LSEG’s estimate of $38.31 billion. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Meta reported revenue growth that exceeds 20%.\n\nWith higher average prices per ad and more ad impressions across its apps, advertising revenue grew 22% to $38.33 billion, showing Meta is continues to dominate the digital ad market, its core business. This growth rate is double compared to its biggest rival, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), who last week reported Google ad revenue growth of 11% while its YouTube sales fell short of expectations.\n\nExpenses amounted to $24.2 billion, including charge from its recent $1.4 billion agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas. Capital expenditures of $8.47 billion were below LSEG’s consensus estimate of $9.51 billion.\n\nOperating income climbed 58% to $14.9 billion as operating margin expanded from last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 29% to 38%.\n\nNet income jumped 73% to $13.47 billion with earnings of $5.16 a share surpassing LSEG’s consensus estimate of $4.73 per share.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nMeta expects current quarter revenue in the range between $38.5 billion and $41 billion.\n\nAI-related developments\n\nMeta AI, which rivals offerings from Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ: MSFT) OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google is stated to be on track to become the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. But, monetizing this tool will take time.\n\nWith its AI offerings, Meta also aims to make its core business, advertising, more effective, using these tools to improve ad performance and the overall user experience.\n\nAfter recently unveiling its most capable open-source AI model yet, Llama 3.1  as part of its AI push, Zuckerberg revealed Meta is already working on Llama 4, which it ambitiously aims to become \"the most advanced in the industry next year.\" This speed of development emphasizes  Meta’s determination to ensure that its technology is on par with  that of rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google.\n\nHeavy AI infrastructure spending to avoid being late.\n\nLike Google, Microsoft and other tech peers, Meta boosted spending to invest in AI infrastructure, raising concerns about whether these massive costs will pay off. In addition, Meta CFO Susan Li revealed Meta expects significant CapEx growth in 2025. But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shares the reasoning with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, prefering to risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than risk being too late.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s financials continue to benefit from cost-cutting efforts that Meta kicked off in late 2022. But the highlight of the report was undoubtedly the AI spending spree. Although Meta also needs to prove its ambitious AI visions are worth the investment, like Google, Meta is delivering when it comes revenue growth and earnings beats, which is undoutebtedly easing investor concerns.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Amazon to report second quarter earnings with AWS sales and AI spending in spotlight",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to post quarterly earnings after the bell on Thursday, wrapping a wave of Big Tech results that have flashed warnings that investors have limited patience for massive AI spending.\n\nThe company is expected to offer updates on the progress of its AI initiatives, the growth of its lucrative cloud business, and the build-out of its advertising segment.\n\nAmazon's report will arrive days after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) posted lower than expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors running.\n\nMeta (META), on the other hand, earned the applause of Wall Street, delivering better than expected results for revenue and profit, even as executives warned they anticipate \"significant\" capital expenditures in 2025. Shares were up 10% Thursday morning. Apple (AAPL) will round out earnings from the major tech platforms after the closing bell.\n\nThe mixed reactions to the reports so far highlight the evolution of the AI trade. It is no longer enough to commit massive resources to ambitious AI initiatives. Investors and analysts are now looking for returns on those investments, or in place of new revenue streams, more details about when major spending will start to pay off.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Amazon’s most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue: $148.8 billion expected ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.04 expected (65 cents in Q2 2023) Amazon Web Services: $26 billion expected ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023) Advertising: $13 billion expected ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)\n\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters last quarter that overall capital expenditures are expected to \"meaningfully\" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS.\n\nThe company sees the potential for AI initiatives to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. Customers have been signing up for longer AWS deals with bigger commitments, many with generative AI components, executives have said. Analysts expect benefits from Amazon's annual Prime Day event to be a boost to the company's outlook. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn a note ahead of earnings, Bank of America Global Research analysts said they expect a second quarter that exceeds expectations for revenue and operating profit, owing to accelerating demand for AWS services and AI features, the potential ramp up of Prime Video ads, and an outlook boost from Prime Day benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWS’s growth trajectory and the advertising segment’s contributions among Amazon’s strengths.\n\nLast quarter, advertising revenue swelled by 24%. AWS sales jumped by 16%, and executives said the business line is on track to generate $100 billion annually. Both segments are expected to grow again by double digit percentages.\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders, Wall Street has adopted a more discerning stance toward AI spending.\n\nBut analysts say Amazon is well positioned to capitalize on the AI transition. As the biggest player in the cloud industry, Amazon Web Services claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition from the likes of Temu and Shein, companies that specialize in low cost goods that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own, to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It’s possible Amazon will offer an update on those efforts as it works to defend its online shopping empire.\n\nAmazon's earnings report will arrive just a day after the conclusion of the Fed's July policy meeting, when officials kept interest rates unchanged but signaled that the first cut is on the table for their next meeting in September. The timing of an eventual easing cycle will impact Amazon and other major tech stocks, which have powered 2024's equity rally.\n\nInvestors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Broadcom Stock Buy Alert: The Hidden AI Gem With Dividend Potential",
        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a custom artificial intelligence chip designer, isn’t quite the market superstar that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is. However, Broadcom might actually catch up to Nvidia in certain respects. Investors may choose to own shares of Broadcom stock and Nvidia stock for more complete portfolio exposure to the AI-chip industry.\n\nBesides, Broadcom deserves credit for respecting its shareholders. The company shows its respect by delivering decent cash distributions each and every quarter. Therefore, growth and income investors should both take a closer look at Broadcom in 2024’s second half.\n\nBroadcom Stock and the Catch-Up Trade\n\nAs we’ll discuss in a moment, Broadcom beats Nvidia when it comes to quarterly dividend payments. However, here’s something you might not have expected. One analyst actually suggested that Broadcom could rival Nvidia as a financial-market darling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCitigroup analyst Christopher Danely declared that Broadcom stock is “catching up” to Nvidia stock as a semiconductor stock with the most positive investor sentiment.\n\nAccording to Barron’s, Danely “met last week with investors to discuss their favorite and least favorite chip stocks,” and determined that Broadcom is “right behind” Nvidia in terms of upbeat investor sentiment.\n\nRemember, this clearly isn’t a formal research study. Yet, Danely made some interesting points about Broadcom’s growth in the AI-chip industry. In particular, he observed that Broadcom “has more AI customers joining (Open AI and ByteDance) and accretion from VMware.”\n\nThat growth observation is a better reason to invest in Broadcom than just trying to play a “catch up to Nvidia” trade. In the end, there’s no need to pit Broadcom against Nvidia. They’re both good companies in a fast-growing AI-chip market.\n\nBroadcom’s Enticing Dividends\n\nCircling back to the idea that Broadcom respects its shareholders, we can confidently assert that the company pays an enticing dividend. Currently, Broadcom offers a forward annual dividend yield of 1.38%.\n\nThat might not sound like much, especially if you’re an income-focused investor. There are energy and real estate companies that pay higher dividends than Broadcom, no doubt.\n\nBut then, it’s not fair to compare Broadcom to energy and real estate companies. What’s more relevant is that Broadcom’s forward annual dividend yield is higher than the technology sector’s average yield of 1.025%.\n\nFor more tech-sector comparisons, note that Nvidia’s forward annual dividend yield is 0.04%. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) offers 0.43% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers 0.47%. So, Broadcom is generous on a relative basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom Stock: A Good AI-Chip Income Opportunity\n\nWill Broadcom “catch up” to Nvidia? Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nPer Barron’s, JPMorgan Chase analyst Harlan Sur envisions Broadcom as possibly generating “$150 billion in cumulative AI revenue over the next five years.” Thus, Broadcom is a fast-growing business in its own right, irrespective of Nvidia’s growth.\n\nAnd if you like to collect quarterly cash distributions, Broadcom is more generous than some other famous large-cap technology companies. With all of this in mind, Broadcom stock earns a “B” grade and can be combined with Nvidia stock for potentially powerful results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Because They Are Brands Consumers Love",
        "content": "Consumer-centric brands often focus, and thrive, off of one thing–the amount of money or time (depending on the business model used) users spend on it. As consumers, we can agree that when we find a brand we like, we stick with it until something changes. This may include skincare, personal finance, or even investing! While there are many such companies out there, what’s important is that we single out companies. We do so based on future viability, current status, and the potential to make great returns for readers. As for our readers, they want to hear about the top stocks to buy, which is where this list comes in handy.\n\nHere are three companies that I believe will offer you a great starting off point.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the world’s most recognizable coffee joints. Starting from a humble store in Pike’s Place Market, in Seattle, this giant is now the world’s third-largest restaurant chain. It is trading at a valuation of $77.95 as of market close on Wednesday, July 31st. Analyst expectations suggest an implied upside of over 10% at this price point.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSBUX has met revenue estimates for the last quarter, which is a positive sign given the fact that it had missed estimates for the two quarters preceding this one. However, revenue and earnings have fallen year-over-year. While this can be attributed to many factors, inflationary pressure and public backlash over the situation in Gaza, and how management handled it, are key concerns.\n\nAs inflationary pressures and the conflict subside, I expect a significant uptick in total revenue and a growth in same-store sales. This will likely propel SBUX stock to new heights, making early investors proud. This is definitely a consumer-centric brand to invest in, and one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company known for its e-commerce platform, cloud computing (AWS), Prime membership, consumer electronics (like Kindle and Echo), digital content, logistics and delivery services, and physical stores such as Amazon Go and Whole Foods Market.\n\nAMZN stock is currently trading at $186.98 as of the market close on 07/31/24 with a market cap of $1.94 trillion. The company’s business model is profitable. The stock saw profit and operating margins of 6.38% and 10.68% respectively. The company’s revenue has grown by $60.8 billion over the past year. Furthermore, the company has a year-on-year (YOY) quarterly revenue growth rate of 12.50%. Amazon Prime’s membership base has surpassed 200 million subscribers globally, contributing significantly to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s earnings report is due to come out today (08/01/2024), and analysts are predicting sales to reach $148.7 billion, marking a 10.7% increase over the same period last year. A significant focus of this earnings report will be AI, since its central to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing unit. AWS has been a major growth driver for Amazon, with almost 16% of the company’s revenue coming from AWS. Given these factors, Amazon’s strong fundamentals and growth potential make it a compelling stock to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) formerly known as Facebook, Inc., is a global tech company operating social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It also invests heavily in VR and AR through Oculus and the development of the metaverse for immersive digital experiences.\n\nMETA stock has been up 3% since yesterday after a positive earnings report and is predicted to rise even more today.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged but signaled the possibility of a cut next month. The Bank of England has that decision to make later in the session. Meta Platforms impressed with its quarterly earnings, and Apple is next up after the close.\n\n1. Fed lifts September rate cut confidence\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its latest policy-setting meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected, but acknowledged recent progress on inflation, raising investor hopes that the central bank could begin cutting rates in the near future.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, kept its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as it has done over the past year as it battled elevated inflation.\n\nHowever, recent data point to progress on inflation, suggesting that the Fed's restrictive policies are working.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,\" the Fed said Wednesday in its July policy statement, with the addition of the word “somewhat” marking a subtle change from its June statement.\n\nA September rate cut of 25 basis points is now almost fully priced in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, but traders also added to bets the Federal Reserve will go big when it does cut.\n\nRate futures prices now reflect about a 17% chance of a 50-basis point rate cut in September, versus about 5% before Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nThe Fed also acknowledged a cooling in the labor market, stating that the committee is \"attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate\" - to maintain stable prices and strive for maximum employment.\n\nFriday sees the release of the closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report, as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\n2. Futures steady after Fed meeting\n\nU.S. stock futures traded in a steady manner Thursday, as investors digested the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as more corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 45 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed higher Wednesday, with the S&P 500 gaining 16%, its best day since February, the Nasdaq Composite surging 2.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%.\n\nThese gains followed the Fed signaling that a rate cut could occur in September if inflation continues to cool.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) [see below] and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEconomic data due for release Thursday includes weekly jobless claims data, construction spending for June and ISM Manufacturing data for July, ahead of Friday’s widely-watched monthly jobs report.\n\n3. Meta soars after impressive Q2\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reported strong second-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, bucking the recent trend of poorly received results from the country’s mega cap tech companies.\n\nMeta Platforms, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue, seeing quarterly growth of 22%.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts on a call that the company was \"continuing to see healthy global advertising demand\", benefiting from its plans to use artificial intelligence to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\n\nThe tech giant also issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial-intelligence investments.\n\nAlthough Meta's costs rose 7% in the second quarter, its revenue jump topped expense growth substantially and led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, to 38% from 29%.\n\nMeta stock soared over 7% after hours, contrasting with the losses that both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered when they released these numbers over the last few days.\n\n4. Apple revenue to bounce back in Q3\n\nIt’s Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) turn to face the judgment of investors, as the iPhone maker releases its fiscal third-quarter results after the close Thursday.\n\nApple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, bouncing back after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter, as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple in May offered hefty discounts on select iPhone models, helping narrow sales declines in the country.\n\nElsewhere, iPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for this product line.\n\nApple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.\n\n5. Bank of England to cut?\n\nThe Bank of England completes this week’s round of central bank rate decisions later Thursday, after the Bank of Japan delivered its second interest rate hike in 17 years and the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted it could lower rates in September after standing pat.\n\nThe moves, or lack of them, by the BOJ and the Fed were largely expected, but there is greater uncertainty than usual of the Bank of England's meeting as key policymakers have not spoken publicly for more than two months in the run-up to the country’s general election in early July.\n\nThe Bank of England has held its benchmark interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the past year as it tackled inflation, which soared to a 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nU.K. consumer price inflation returned to the BOE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, suggesting a cut later Thursday is a distinct possibility.\n\nIn June, the MPC voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the meeting recorded that several of those who voted to hold had been close to voting for a cut.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed guidance, BOE, Meta's results, Apple - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ sees chance wages, inflation could overshoot\n\nAnalysis-BOJ governor's hawkish streak signals more hikes to come\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg sees a WhatsApp boom in the U.S. as a game changer",
        "content": "WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world with billions of monthly active users around the globe, but it’s never quite caught on with American audiences.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose Meta Platforms bought the app for $19 billion in 2014, really wants to reverse that trend, he said during a conference call with financial analysts on Wednesday. And if more U.S. users convert to WhatsApp, it could mean a sea change for the Facebook parent company, said Zuckerberg. Meta previously announced that the app had crossed a milestone of 100 million monthly active users in the U.S.\n\n“The WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend, just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of—it's such a large percent of our revenue,” said Zuckerberg during the call. “All of the work that we're doing to grow the business opportunity… over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the U.S. ends up being a big market so that's one reason why it's really relevant.”\n\nA breakdown of Meta's revenue by user geography shows that the U.S. and Canada represented 38% of its total $39 billion in revenues this quarter, while revenues from Asia, Europe and the rest of the world accounted for the rest.\n\nWhatsApp is part of Meta’s “family of apps,” which includes flagship social networking platform Facebook, Instagram, Facebook messenger, and Threads. Revenue for that segment was $38.7 billion in the quarter, up 22%. Meta reported net profits of $13.5 billion this quarter, notching a more than 70% rise over the same period last year.\n\nAs for WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said that as the app has begun to make inroads with U.S. users, people have begun to realize, “Hey, this is a really good experience,” he said, which could kick off as more people try out group-chat functions and cross-platform communication.\n\n“It's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp,” said Zuckerberg. “So that's pretty fun, but maybe less relevant from a business perspective.”\n\nStill, the bloom has come off the rose in recent years for Meta and WhatsApp. U.S. antitrust regulator the Federal Trade Commission sued the company in 2020 and recently alleged that it withheld information from officials during its reviews of Meta’s acquisition of WhatsApp and its 2012 acquisition of Instagram. For its part, Meta filed a motion for summary judgment, stating that the FTC has no evidence to support its claims.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

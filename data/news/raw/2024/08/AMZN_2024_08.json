        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Jim Cramer’s 10 Stock Picks You Shouldn’t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other top stock picks.\n\nJim Cramer reacted to Monday’s market by questioning if there’s any money left to invest and why mutual funds aren’t holding enough cash. The S&P 500 fell 17.77 points, or 0.3%, to 5,616.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.44 points, or 0.2% to 41,240.52. The Nasdaq composite fell 152.03 points, or 0.9%, to 17,725.76.\n\n“What do we do if we’re out of money? Don’t mutual funds have enough cash? That’s my reaction to today’s market action. Right now, mutual funds know they have to pivot out of consistent growth stocks, especially tech stocks like software and semiconductors, which don’t benefit from rate cuts. They need to swap into companies that can supercharge their earnings as the Fed lowers rates. We all recognize that cyclical stocks, the ones that benefit from lower rates, can go higher, maybe much higher.”\n\nCramer pointed out that mutual funds now need to shift away from consistent growth stocks, particularly in tech sectors like software and semiconductors, which don’t benefit from interest rate cuts. Instead, they should move towards companies that can boost their earnings as the Federal Reserve reduces rates.\n\n“What’s painful for many of you are the declines in stocks of companies with consistent earnings. These companies, especially tech firms, don’t really need lower rates, and they’re selling off as money managers raise capital to rotate into the rate-cut winners.\n\nSo, why don’t we go over the winners and talk about the losers? The rate-cut winners are divided into two camps: stocks with high dividend yields and cyclical companies with earnings that should go higher because lower rates will bolster various industries, especially housing.”\n\nCramer explained that cyclical stocks, which tend to perform better with lower rates, are likely to rise, possibly significantly. However, the decline in stocks of companies with stable earnings, especially in tech, is troubling for many investors. These stocks are being sold off as money managers raise capital to invest in those poised to benefit from rate cuts.\n\nCramer emphasized that it’s important to understand who the winners and losers are in this situation. The winners include two groups: high-dividend-yield stocks and cyclical companies expected to see earnings growth from lower rates, particularly in the housing sector.\n\nCramer noted that housing stocks, which had seen significant gains, were down on Monday because hedge funds and mutual funds had bought heavily before the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting. While mutual funds are holding on, hedge funds are cashing in their profits, as these stocks had sharp increases before the event. For traders, taking profits after such a successful trade is standard practice.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Let’s start with the most direct beneficiaries: housing. These stocks were all down today because hedge funds and mutual funds bought them aggressively ahead of Friday’s Jackson Hole verdict. Mutual funds are staying long, but hedge funds are ringing the register furiously because they’ve made so much money. Housing stocks had parabolic moves going into the Fed’s Jackson Hole conference, so now these portfolio managers are just taking profits. That’s what you’re supposed to do with a successful trade if you’re a trader.\n\nRemember, these guys are traders, not investors. So, the housing trade is over, but what about the housing investment? I believe Toll Brothers, which just reported a stellar quarter last week, can go higher, maybe much higher. But this reversal is going to constrain the stock because people do not like the technical trends we just saw. We’ve seen multiple long-term reversals after these kinds of moves, and they rarely turn out to be buyable, even though in theory, this should be a great moment for the stock of all the homebuilders.”\n\nCramer believes that while the housing trade may be over for traders, the housing investment story isn’t finished. He also warned that the recent reversal in housing stocks could limit their potential, as investors are wary of the technical trends.\n\n“It doesn’t matter, though. This kind of reversal I’m talking about can be hideous. Some of these stocks are very close to their highs, and I don’t like that.”\n\nCramer cautioned that these kinds of reversals can be severe and might discourage new buyers. He reminded everyone that by the time the Federal Reserve signals a clear path forward, it might be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. According to Cramer, it’s better to wait for these stocks to pull back and recharge before making a move.\n\n“Those who have them can hold on, but they flew too close to the sun to attract new buyers. Remember, I’ve said all along that by the time the Fed gives the all-clear, it may be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. You have to let them recharge, let them come down, and then you can pull the trigger.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money and picked the ten notable stocks he mentioned. We also explore what hedge funds think about these stocks and rank them based on how many hedge funds own them, from the fewest to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nJim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), highlighting its potential to revolutionize shopping by anticipating customers’ needs even before they realize them. He believes that if Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can manage to group and process same-day purchases efficiently, it could lead to significant cost savings. Cramer sees this capability as a major step forward for the company.\n\n“I like Amazon—the possibility of knowing exactly what you want before you even thought of it is the next frontier. If Amazon can find a way to batch every same-day purchase, I think it can save a fortune.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an attractive investment due to its leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing, strong financial performance, and strategic growth initiatives. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) excels in global e-commerce with its broad product range, competitive pricing, and efficient delivery network, which consistently drives revenue growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a major profit engine, benefiting from its ongoing innovation and expansion in the cloud market.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s strategic investments and acquisitions enhance its market presence and foster growth across various sectors. The rapidly growing advertising segment provides high-margin revenue, boosting overall profitability. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s focus on technological innovation and improving customer experience further strengthens its competitive advantage. Furthermore, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s expansion into emerging markets supports long-term growth and revenue diversification.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among Goldman Sachs’ Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\n\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\n\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\n\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\n\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\n\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\n\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities’ PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\n\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\n\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 308\n\nGS' Number Of Funds: 99\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's biggest eCommerce retailer. Along with its eCommerce platform, the firm is a key player in the lucrative enterprise computing market through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business division. These two are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s biggest businesses, and its sizeable resources have enabled the firm to become another key player in the AI race through its work with Anthropic. Anthropic allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with access to a foundational AI model called Claude. Like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Google's Gemini, Claude allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its customers to build AI powered experiences for a multitude of use cases such as chat bots. The firm's eCommerce business also makes it a key player in the advertising industry, especially since it attracted 3.25 billion users in June. Data shows that a growing number of advertisers are now focused on customized advertising through sites such as Amazon, and AI enables Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to improve its advertising product portfolio for merchants and publishers. However, legal headwinds in the form of predatory merchant practices or anti trust action could create troubles for the firm.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\n\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\n\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Latest reports reveal that the US government has signed a deal with Anthropic, a US-based AI startup backed by Amazon, for research, testing and evaluation of their artificial intelligence model. Under the terms of the deal, an institute associated with the government would receive access to the AI model before and after the public release. Anthropic is one of the leading developers of a large language model (LLM), the cutting edge tech that forms the basis for the popularity of ChatGPT by OpenAI.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most followed stocks on Wall Street. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $225. In a recent investor note, the advisory underlined that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, would reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027, even as the launches present an attractive longer term opportunity.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks.

        "title": "Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN): Jim Cramer’s Go-To Stock For Success",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Go-To Stocks for Success.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against Jim Cramer's other go-to stocks for success.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer offers a perspective on Nvidia and its recent market behavior on Wednesday's episode of Mad Money, presenting a straightforward analysis of the company's stock performance and the broader implications for investors. Cramer notes that owning the company's stock was easier when the company was less well-known. As the company has become a major market focus, it's attracted significant attention and criticism, which is evident after its recent financial report.\n\n\"Once you get this big, to the point where you become the focal point of the entire stock market, you're going to have a target on your back. And that's exactly what I think happened tonight to the stock after the firm reported a fine and dandy set of numbers. But fine and dandy is no longer enough for this incredible company.\"\n\nDespite reporting impressive numbers—122% revenue growth, a 152% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and a $50 billion buyback— the firm's stock fell after hours. This reaction reflects high expectations that may have become unrealistic. The stock market as a whole suffered due to pre-quarter jitters surrounding the company, with declines in major indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. The drop in the firm's stock price after the earnings report, coupled with concerns about its influence on the broader market, has led some to call this period the GPU maker's \"buzzkill quarter.\"\n\n\"The Dow declining 59 points was bad, the S&P losing 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite 1.12%. And now, with the stock sinking after hours, we could be in for a hangover from what they're already calling the company's buzzkill quarter. But the people saying this might as well be having a watch party—yes, there was one—but there's nothing to celebrate here. Move on.\"\n\nCramer emphasizes that the company's role in artificial intelligence is significant, but its overemphasis has become a burden on the market. The company's market capitalization has skyrocketed from around $500 billion to over $3 trillion in just 18 months. Cramer suggests that the company's immense importance might be overblown and that a recalibration might benefit the market.\n\n\"We know that artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and it's the best bet on AI. But the company has become an albatross around the market's neck because no one stock should be a proxy for the future of the S&P 500. Yet, that's exactly what's happened as the company has grown from around $500 billion in market cap just 18 months ago to more than $3 trillion now. Maybe after tonight, it will shed that millstone—like Apple did. You know what? That would be a godsend for all of us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer expresses frustration with how quickly concerns about the company have spread to the broader tech sector, although he acknowledges that companies like Salesforce reported positive numbers. Cramer concludes by advising investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just tech stocks. He suggests that while diversification might seem less exciting, it is a crucial strategy to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single sector or stock.\n\n\"It felt like insult added to injury when there was no injury to the company. It will muddle through and recharge at its next iteration. Blackwell goes boring, and we see renewed expectations. I hope they don't get excessive like they were tonight.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed ten stocks he believes have significant growth potential.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) reported a notable revenue increase to $1.12 billion from $364 million the previous year, driven by higher production and deliveries. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) delivered 12,640 vehicles in the quarter, surpassing expectations.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), a U.S.-based EV manufacturer, declined 53.3% in the first quarter. Despite substantial improvements in production and delivery volumes in 2023, as well as an improvement in unit economics, Rivian’s business remains constrained by its limited scale, which creates pressure on gross margins, and contributes to the company’s elevated cash burn. Additionally, Rivian expects to temporarily shut down its production facilities for upgrades, impeding anticipated production growth in 2024. Compounding these challenges is the potential for demand headwinds due to the continued complex macro environment, and the relatively small automotive segments that Rivian’s initial products target. Nevertheless, the recent unveiling of Rivian’s mass-market products, the R2 and R3, garnered enthusiastic responses, evidenced by over 68,000 pre-orders within the first 20 hours post-launch. In a strategic move, management opted to produce the R2 in Rivian’s existing facility, deferring the construction of a new factory. This decision should help reduce mid-term capital expenditure obligations while ensuring higher utilization of current facilities as the R2 ramps production in 2025. We remain shareholders.”\n\nOverall RIVN ranks 7th on our list of Jim Cramer's go-to stocks for success. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Incredible FAANG Stocks You'll Want to Consider Adding to Your Portfolio in September",
        "content": "It's been a while since the so-called FAANG stocks were all must-have names. Other companies like Nvidia and Microsoft have since stolen their thunder. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) helped this happen, of course.\n\nWith the AI euphoria finally starting to fade, though -- and with the economy easing its way back to normal -- investors should soon start seeing how all the things that made FAANG stocks so great then still apply now. That's why you may want to step into some of them sooner or later, particularly given that a few of these stocks are trading at a discount right now.\n\nHere's a closer look at three FAANG stocks that are best bets for September.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been very un-Amazon-like since early July. Share prices are currently down more than 10% from that month's record high and are still sinking, headed into what's historically a tough month for the stock market.\n\nAt least some of the weakness stems from the company's second-quarter revenue miss. Although sales of $148 billion were up 10% year over year, analysts were calling for a top line of $148.7 billion. Investors flinched, and understandably so.\n\nYou might want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though.\n\nThe fact is, Amazon is still a growth steamroller no other e-commerce player wants to compete with. It controls around 40% of the United States' online shopping market (according to data from eMarketer), trouncing next-nearest Walmart's reach. And, being a name that's nearly synonymous with the e-commerce industry, it's arguably better positioned than any rival to capture more than its share of the industry's continued growth. It's doing pretty well outside of the U.S. as well; last quarter's international e-commerce revenue was up nearly 7%.\n\nPerhaps Amazon's most underestimated growth engine, however, is its cloud computing arm. Amazon Web Services sales improved by nearly 19% year over year during the three-month stretch ending in June, leading to a 74% increase in its cloud business's operating income. Both numbers extend well-established trends that should carry on into the distant future, too. Market research outfit Mordor Intelligence believes the global cloud computing industry will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nSo, why are Amazon shares retreating? It's got much to do with the wobbly market environment itself and even more to do with the stock's big run-up from its late-2022 low to June's high. There's a lot of opportunistic profit-taking going on here. However, that's actually a long-term opportunity for you.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDitto for Google's parent, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). That is, the stock is down since early July thanks to a combination of marketwide weakness and a second-quarter earnings stumble. Although its overall bottom line of $1.89 per share was better than expected, YouTube's revenue came up short.\n\nOh, there's also the possibility that the Department of Justice will soon be recommending a breakup of the company.\n\nIn early August, a federal court determined that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" While the company is preparing an appeal of the decision, the court is proceeding. The next stage of the process is the DOJ's proposal for a remedy, scheduled for submission no later than Sept. 4, with a meeting of all involved parties slated for Sept. 6. It's widely expected that, at the very least, the Department of Justice will ask Alphabet to divest its Chrome browser, or its Android mobile operating system, or both. The company could also be required to share more of its collected data with third parties.\n\nIt's certainly a troubling prospect on the surface. Alphabet's success largely hinges on dominating multiple facets of how people navigate the internet. Even if just one of them goes away, Google's reach is seemingly disproportionally weakened.\n\nHowever, maybe it isn't.\n\nSure, Android steers people toward the Google Play app store. Chrome and Google's online services, like Gmail and Google Docs, work very well together. Google is the default search engine on many manufacturers' connectable devices because Alphabet can afford to outbid other search engine operators for this placement.\n\nTo believe consumers won't seek out these services and tools without a nudge from Google, however, may be wishful thinking on the DOJ's part. The world loves Google's search engine because it's simple and effective. Owners of Android devices -- the world's most-used mobile operating system -- are going to find Google Play anyway. Folks like Chrome just because Chrome works well.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Department of Justice and the U.S. court system can't rattle investors more than they already have. Together or in pieces, though, Alphabet's breadwinning ad business is going to be OK.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but certainly not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of FAANG stocks to buy in September.\n\nApple shares have performed quite differently than Alphabet or Amazon have of late. While both Amazon and Apple stocks are down following sizable run-ups, Apple shares are now trading near record highs following significant stagnation between early 2022 and April of this year.\n\nWhat changed? Artificial intelligence. Although it was a bit late to the AI party, Apple is making up for lost time. In June, the company introduced what it calls \"Apple Intelligence,\" which turns Apple's newest iPhones and iPads into full-blown generative AI devices capable of handling this heavy-duty work without punting the effort to the cloud (where most consumer-friendly artificial intelligence work is currently done). This evolution is expected to reignite long-stagnant iPhone sales in terms of revenue as well as individual units.\n\nThe thing is, the launch of Apple Intelligence will likely do just that, but perhaps even more than expected. Technology market research firm IDC predicts generative-AI smartphone deliveries will swell from 234 million units this year to more than 900 million such devices in 2028, at which point AI-capable smartphones will account for nearly 80% of the global mobile phone market.\n\nAlready the world's single-most-popular smartphone, Apple's iPhone is well positioned to capture more than its fair share of this growth.\n\nThe kicker: While Apple will certainly enjoy any revenue growth stemming from the impending improvement in iPhone sales, getting the company's popular mobile phone in more consumers' hands does something else that's arguably even more fruitful. That is, it sets the stage for even more services revenue. Services is now not only Apple's second-biggest business but is also (by far) its highest-margin business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's AI Bets: 29.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's $316 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of history's most successful investors. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930, Buffett went on to deliver one of the most incredible track records of money-making wins. Since purchasing a controlling stake in Berkshire Hathaway and becoming its CEO in 1965, the Oracle of Omaha's company has delivered returns of more than 3,800,000% -- enough to turn a $1,000 investment into over $38 million.\n\nBut while Buffett is best-known as a market-crushing value investor, his company's stock portfolio actually has substantial exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) and other growth trends. If you're looking to take a page out of the famously successful investor's playbook, read on for a look at two AI stocks that account for 29.3% of Berkshire's stock holdings.\n\nHow is Buffett playing the AI stock trend?\n\nKeith Noonan: Following some volatile trading, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has roared back to once again become the world's most valuable company. With a market cap of roughly $3.44 trillion, the company actually has a significant lead on Nvidia and Microsoft -- which are valued at $3.11 trillion and $3.08 trillion, respectively.\n\nComing in at roughly 28.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's total stock portfolio, Apple is Buffett's biggest overall bet by far and the cornerstone of the company's investments in AI. But getting a read on Berkshire's AI strategy has gotten a bit harder recently.\n\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire actually sold 389 million shares of Apple stock. The move reduced the investment conglomerate's overall holdings in the tech giant by 49%.\n\nWith Apple stock reaching a new all-time high in the first half of the year, it's not shocking that Berkshire opted to take some profits, diversify its portfolio weighting, and increase its cash pile. But there may be other reasons why Buffett and his analysts opted to sell some Apple stock.\n\nIn general, Berkshire's recent moves and commentary suggest the company is taking a cautious approach to the stock market at large. There may also be some uncertainty as to what Apple's position will be in the rapidly expanding, shifting world of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe iPhone has been an incredible performance driver, and it's frequently made Apple the world's most profitable business on an annual basis over the last decade. The company has dominated the mobile hardware space and continues to look very strong overall, but AI is a disruptive technology that could shake up industry positioning. On the other hand, the strength of the iPhone also gives Apple strong foundations for AI hardware and software initiatives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the release of the iPhone Pro 16 next month, Apple will take its first big step into mobile hardware tailored for artificial intelligence. AI-focused phones look to be the next major step forward for the mobile space, and could wind up being the next growth driver for the otherwise stagnant mobile market. No other company has stronger positioning in the overall mobile space, and the industry leader will have opportunities to leverage those foundations to score big wins in artificial intelligence.\n\nAI could wind up being a powerful performance driver for Apple. But as Buffett's recent moves suggest, it may be wise not to put all your eggs in one basket at this stage in the game.\n\nAmazon has an edge in cloud computing\n\nJennifer Saibil: It has never made sense to bet against Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and these days, it looks as strong as ever. Its e-commerce business is still healthy, and it's making strides in streaming, as well as other segments, but what's really driving interest these days is the incredible opportunities in AI.\n\nAmazon isn't one to miss trends. In fact, it's more likely to grab trends and fail rather than lose the chance to become a leader in the next big thing. It's done that plenty, and that's why it now a master of many diverse and profitable businesses.\n\nAmazon has been at the forefront of AI for years, using it to power its stores business with features like product recommendations and delivery organization. Generative AI is what's creating excitement these days, and Amazon has its huge data stores to drive innovation and growth in this area. It offers a wide array of services for its Amazon Web Services clients, and it sees its edge in its three-tier system. The highest tier is services for developers to create their own large-language models (LLMs) with complete customization, the middle tier is for developers to use Amazon's LLMs for a semi-custom experience, and the lowest tier is for smaller businesses to use turnkey generative AI systems for solutions like a total marketing campaign or product images and descriptions.\n\nManagement says there's already been a robust response, with high usage of its products. And it sees this as just the beginning. CEO Andy Jassy said that over the past year and a half, Amazon has launched more than double the features of all other major cloud companies -- combined. \"This team is cooking,\" Jassy said, \"but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customers' interface.\"\n\nAI wouldn't normally be on Buffett's docket, and at just 0.5% of its total portfolio, Berkshire's position in Amazon isn't nearly as large as its Apple holdings. But Amazon as a company is backed up by its unbeatable e-commerce business and asset-light cloud computing segment that's also the No. 1 leader in the industry. You get the best of both worlds with Amazon: the reliable Amazon name and tremendous AI opportunities.\n\nDespite all this, Amazon stock tanked after its second-quarter earnings release, and it's trading close to its lowest valuation in years. Wall Street didn't love its sales guidance and slight miss on revenue in the second quarter. That makes this an unusual opportunity to buy this Buffett stock at a bargain price that you don't want to miss.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Affordable Stocks Under $40 According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) stands against the other affordable stocks under $40.\n\nSeveral traders tend to profit from stocks through appreciation. However, some do the opposite-- their idea is to profit from stocks when their value declines. This happens through a strategy known as short selling. In simple words, short selling means borrowing a security whose price is expected to fall and then selling it in an open market. Later, the trader buys that same stock back, hopefully at a lower price than initially sold for. The trader then returns the borrowed stock to the broker and pockets the difference.\n\nShort interest serves as a barometer of investor sentiment towards a stock, sector, or market. Short interest represents the number of shares that have been sold short and are still outstanding. Since short sellers tend to benefit from the decline in the stock price, rising short interest generally signals higher negative investor sentiment. On the other hand, declining short interest means investors are becoming less bearish.\n\nShort Sellers Made Fortunes Despite S&P 500 Touching Record Highs\n\nBloomberg reported that short sellers saw a strong 2Q 2024, despite the broader market touching record highs.\n\nOver the past 6 months, the S&P 500 saw an increase of over ~11%. How did the short sellers make money in this environment? Short sellers amassed about $10 billion in paper profits during 2Q 2024.\n\nThe paper earnings from sectors like industrials, health care, and financials were able to offset the $15.7 billion mark-to-market losses experienced in technology.\n\nThis means that investors continue to flock to just a few mega-cap technology stocks amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Therefore, there were some areas of weakness in other sectors. During the quarter ended 28 June, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index saw an increase of over ~7%. Meanwhile, the energy sector witnessed the most short covering during 2Q 2024.\n\nShort Sellers Saw Record Weekly Profits Due to Broad-Based Tech Decline\n\nWhile the short sellers saw losses in 2Q 2024 as a result of broad-based buying in the technology stocks, the group was able to pocket some gains in early April 2024. Reuters reported that traders who bet against the \"Mag 7\" group of the US technology stocks were able to book their biggest-ever weekly profit of over $10 billion in mid-April. During that time, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index and S&P 500 saw 6 straight sessions of declines as there was high inflation and evidence of resilience in the US economy. As a result, the rate cut hopes were hampered, benefiting the group of short sellers.\n\nAs per LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group plc) data, overall, Big Tech shed ~$1 trillion in their market cap.\n\nShort Bets Have Now Declined, Large Bank Says\n\nJPMorgan believes that consecutive highs in the broader US stock market turned short selling into a difficult trade. Therefore, the bets against the US indexes have now tumbled. The declining short interest continues to provide steady support to the US equities, helping to suppress volatility. Experts opine that there are 3 critical factors, because of which it was difficult to bet against the market situation.\n\nFirstly, the short bets are expensive to maintain if the stock starts climbing, a risk that holds significance in today's bull run. The excitement around artificial intelligence (Al), the potential for rate cuts, and the state of the broader economy have all been factored in. Secondly, analysts believe that regulators have added restrictions to short selling, as they have mandated transparency and added costs to short sellers that target equities. Finally, the industry players continue to back out as they face a rising wall of participating retail investors.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 10 Best Affordable Stocks Under $40 according to short sellers, we used the Finviz screener and shortlisted the stocks with prices less than $40. Then, we selected the stocks that have a forward P/E multiple of less than ~22.40x (since the broader market trades at a forward P/E of ~22.40x). Finally, we picked stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and had low short interest. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their short interest.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA young, stylish woman using her smartphone to find inspiration for her latest DIY project.\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)\n\nForward P/E Ratio as of 26 August: 17.85x\n\nShare Price as of 26 August: $31.70\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nShort % of Shares Outstanding (31 July 2024): 4.10%\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) operates and maintains social networking site. It offers an online venue for personal photos, ideas, oddities, decorations, and other items.\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) demonstrated strong progress in 2Q 2024, with sales reaching $853.68 million. This equates to a 20.5% rise on the YoY basis. It achieved profitability with a net income of $8.89 million as compared to a net loss of $34.94 million in 2Q 2023. This exhibits improvement in operational efficiency and strategic partnerships such as VTEX's integration for social commerce expansion.\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) took numerous steps to better monetize the audience. Since 2023, the company enhanced its click-through rates. Its API initiative for third-party integration seems to be working as ~40% of revenue has been coming from that step, as highlighted in its 1Q 2024 earnings call. This exhibits a rise from 28% of total revenue.\n\nThe company has also been capitalizing on the AI trend. In 2Q 2024, the company mentioned that advertisers continue to see improved performance throughout key objectives on Pinterest – from brand awareness to conversion. This was supported by its initiative to roll out AI-powered products and experiences. Thus, the company continues to gain a share of advertising budgets.\n\nMoving forward, a stable ad market and strength from the retail vertical should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the early stages of third-party partnerships with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continue to exhibit promising growth. Wall Street analysts opine that Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS)’s partnership with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) should improve the former’s revenue. This year the partnership should bring in ~$120 million of incremental revenue.\n\nAnalysts at Sanford C. Bernstein raised their target price on shares of Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) from $35.00 to $38.00, giving it a “Market Perform” rating on 1st May. As per Insider Monkey’s 2Q 2024 data, 61 hedge funds were long Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS).\n\nMeridian Funds, managed by ArrowMark Partners, released its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) is a social media platform that enables visual discovery and generates revenue mainly through online advertising and e-commerce. Earnings declined after the company saw tremendous user and revenue growth in 2020- 2021 and grew operating expenses as if the pandemic-fueled growth trajectory would continue. Normalized growth trends and a macro slowdown that affected ad spend eventually hurt earnings per share. We believed that Pinterest had a significant opportunity to resume earnings growth because: 1. Pinterest has an attractive franchise and appears under-monetized vs. social media peers given how well its user experience lends itself to online shopping. 2. Its new CEO, who led commerce initiatives at Google, may portend a virtuous self-help/self-improvement opportunity to unlock monetization. 3. The high levels of operating expense growth vs. sales prior to our investment provides an opportunity for leverage and expense reductions to improve earnings.\n\nPinterest’s stock performed well in the quarter as the thesis played out and the company reported strong results while raising 2023 guidance. We pared back our position during the quarter due to stock appreciation and as the investment becomes less contrarian as our thesis plays out.”\n\nOverall PINS ranks 10th on our list of the best affordable stocks under $40 according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of PINS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than PINS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Drone companies are making huge leaps in regulatory approvals—the path to scale will still be tough",
        "content": "I will preface this newsletter by saying that, despite my best efforts, I still can’t get a potato delivered to my house via drone.\n\nI’ve been excited to get said potato for almost three years now—ever since a friend rang me up and told me that, exactly 6.2 miles away from my home in Arkansas, they were flying drones out behind a Walmart. Naturally, I abandoned my desk and drove on over to see them for myself. And I ended up writing about the operation, startup Zipline’s first outpost in the U.S., for our magazine back in Dec. 2021.\n\nAt the time, there were only a handful of people on the delivery list, and my apartment wasn’t in range. I really wanted to see a potato drop out of the sky, so I tried again in early 2023 when I had moved but received a message back about a month later that Zipline was only flying close to its home base in Pea Ridge and couldn’t deliver to me. Earlier this week, I thought I’d check again. My house is still out of pocket—no potato. (For all those wondering: No, DroneUp, which also makes deliveries with Walmart in Arkansas, won’t deliver a potato to my house either.)\n\nBut while I will continue to gripe about the potato until it drops from the sky, things have never looked better for commercial drone delivery in the U.S. Last year, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started issuing exemptions for companies to fly drones beyond visual line of sight, known in shorthand by people in the industry as “BVLOS.” What exactly does that mean, you ask? Drone operators who are granted the exemption no longer have to have a human watch a drone fly for the entire course of its journey. In other words, a huge burden that has prevented companies from true scale has been lifted for some.\n\nThis was a huge step for the industry when the FAA offered its first exemption to UPS, which uses drone startup Matternet for deliveries, and uAvionix at the end of last year. Shortly after, the FAA extended approvals to Zipline and, just earlier this year, DroneUp and Amazon’s Prime Air, too.\n\n“We've seen a pretty big acceleration in the last few years, and we're starting to see the regulatory system move a little faster,” says James Grimsley, who runs the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma’s drone program and was selected by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttiegeg to help advise the FAA on integrating drones into the airspace. The FAA, which is expected to release the initial draft of its formal BVLOS legislation later this year, is making a “major leap,” Grimsley explains, by reorienting its rules away from its historic dependence on human eyesight and relying on technology.\n\nThese changes are, indeed, allowing companies to scale their U.S. operations.\n\nZipline told me, without providing any specific numbers, that since the approval they’ve tripled the number of U.S. customers they are serving and also increased their U.S. service areas. That includes expanding Arkansas deliveries into Missouri (though still not to my house). Amazon Prime Air says they are expanding into the West Valley Phoenix metro area later this year. Matternet is planning to launch a delivery service in Mountain View, Calif. And the FAA has started allowing multiple carriers, including Alphabet’s Wing, to operate all at once in Dallas.\n\nThe irony is that, as these technologies start to become prolific, they face the two next frontiers: 1) Making the financials of scale work. That’s already led to difficult choices for DroneUp. And 2) The contentious introduction into society. Amazon Prime Air is already seeing some resistance, as residents of a small town north of Houston, including its mayor, have complained that the drones are too noisy. (In response to this, Amazon pointed me to statements made by the city manager in a meeting that indicated that, during his team's own testing, the noise levels stayed below the city’s ordinance limit. Amazon also said that its new drone design will be quieter.)\n\nThe potatoes are starting to drop. It doesn’t look like everyone wants them to.\n\nA quick note… In observance of Labor Day in the U.S., you won’t be receiving this newsletter in your inbox on Monday.

        "title": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying",
        "content": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG’s estimate of 64 cents.\n\nThe gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter’s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.\n\nData center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia’s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of strong Hopper demand.\n\nDelay of Blackwell chip rollout.\n\nThe full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nCompetition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia’s efforts.\n\nSecond to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia’s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Benzinga recently asked which of the Magnificent 7 stocks was the best option for retirement.\n\nWhat Happened: The Magnificent 7 stocks, a select group of highly valuable and widely recognized investments, are often associated with high-growth financials and leading companies in the technology sector.\n\nThe Magnificent 7 stocks are Apple (NASDAQ:APPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\n“If you had to invest your entire retirement account into just one Magnificent 7 stock, which would you choose?” Benzinga asked.\n\nHere are the results:\n\nNvidia: 33%\n\nApple: 21%\n\nMicrosoft: 17%\n\nAmazon: 14%\n\nTesla: 7%\n\nAlphabet: 4%\n\nMeta Platforms: 4%\n\nThe results are hardly surprising given Nvidia’s status as one of the most talked-about growth stories in recent years, with the stock significantly outperforming over the past year.\n\nApple ranked second in the poll and comes as the company is among the top performers over the last five years and has a loyal fan base.\n\nWhy It’s Important: The Magnificent 7 stocks have outperformed the broader stock market over the last five years and 10 years based on the returns compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which tracks the S&P 500.\n\nHere’s a look at the five-year and 10-year returns of the Magnificent 7 stocks:\n\nStock 5-Year Returns 10-Year Returns Nvidia +2,962% +25,603% Apple +337% +822% Microsoft +200% +802% Amazon +95% +900% Tesla +1,291% +1,031% Alphabet +177% +451% Meta +180% +572%\n\nRead More:\n\nCheck it out: Rory McIlroy’s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 — here’s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100. Can you guess how much the average retirement account balance is? Here’s a hint — it’s only slightly more than a year’s worth of expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF is up 92% over the last five years and up 179% over the last 10 years. Each of the Magnificent 7 stocks beats the ETF for both time periods, with many more than doubling its returns.\n\nNvidia recently topped a poll on which Magnificent 7 stock Benzinga readers would invest $1,000 in today. It was Amazon.com that topped Nvidia in a poll on which Magnificent 7 stock could best weather a recession.\n\nFor investors looking to get exposure to all the Magnificent 7 stocks, there is also the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS) which holds the seven companies.\n\nThe study was conducted by Benzinga on Aug. 26 and Aug. 27, 2024, and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from 112 adults.\n\nA 9% Return In Just 3 Months\n\nEquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets.

        "content": "It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors.\n\nAchieving those goals is made easier with the Zacks Style Scores, a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on popular investing methodologies, namely value, growth, and momentum. The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\n\nWhy Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value Stock\n\nDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.\n\nAMZN is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Value Style Score of B and VGM Score of A. Shares are currently trading at a forward P/E of 36.3X for the current fiscal year compared to the Internet - Commerce industry's P/E of 22.7X. Additionally, AMZN has a PEG Ratio of 1.3 and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 22.8X. Value investors should also note AMZN's Price/Sales ratio of 3X.\n\nValue investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. 13 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $4.74 per share. AMZN has an average earnings surprise of 31.1%.\n\nWith strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding AMZN to their portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Dollar General (NYSE:DG) shares plunged more than 32% on Thursday after the discount retailer reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations and significantly lowered its full-year guidance.\n\nFollowing the plunge, analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Telsey Advisory Group downgraded the stock.\n\nThe company's struggles are largely tied to a weaker low-income consumer base and a tougher competitive landscape, which have made its growth path uncertain.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Dollar General from Overweight to Equal-weight, citing a \"tougher path to growth\" and lowering its price target from $170 to $100.\n\nThe investment bank's downgrade reflects concerns over the company's ability to drive the necessary 3% comparable sales growth to leverage expenses, with market share gains seeming unlikely in the near term.\n\nMorgan Stanley noted the \"top-line [was] pressured by a weaker low-income consumer,\" while the delayed margin recovery is a key issue, particularly as competition from giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) intensifies.\n\nThe firm also pointed out that Dollar General's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins could remain around 4.7%, far below the 8.4% margin seen in 2019, indicating a challenging outlook for profitability.\n\nTelsey Advisory Group also downgraded Dollar General, moving its rating from Outperform to Market Perform and lowering the price target to $103 from $168 a share.\n\nTelsey highlighted that while Dollar General's core lower-income customers are visiting stores more frequently, they have less money to spend, especially as they near the end of their pay periods.\n\nAdditionally, middle-income customers, who typically trade down during tough economic times, are not doing so as expected. Instead, these customers are increasing their spending at competitors like Walmart and other discounters.\n\nTelsey also noted that Dollar General has been forced to increase promotions to attract consumers, further squeezing margins.\n\nBoth firms underscore the growing competitive pressures and the uncertain path to recovery for Dollar General, making its outlook more cautious.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAnalysts downgrade Dollar General shares after selloff\n\nAsset managers are long gold and US dollar: Citi\n\nAinylam Pharmaceuticals shares tumble following study results, BridgeBio Pharma rises\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to Buy the Nvidia Dip? Here Are 2 ETFs You Should Take a Look At",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.\n\nThe best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.\n\nA rising tide lifts all chipmakers\n\nNvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.\n\nFor one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.\n\nThis is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.\n\nSo, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.\n\nNvidia isn't the only megacap that has pulled back\n\nAlthough Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.\n\nCompany (Symbol) Percent Below 52-Week High Nvidia (NVDA) 10.4% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 13.7% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 1% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 2.9% Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10.2% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 23% Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) 13%\n\nData source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that these stocks have become \"cheap\" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio. If you think the pullbacks in companies like Alphabet and Amazon.com have been overdone in addition to Nvidia, this ETF could be worth a closer look right now.\n\nWhich is best for you?\n\nBoth of these are solid ETFs with reasonable fees, and the best choice for you depends on what your investment goals are and what groups of stocks you want exposure to. After Nvidia's latest earnings, if you think the recent pullback has gone a bit too far and want to invest but don't necessarily want to open a large position in Nvidia itself, these two ETFs could be smart choices for your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $769,685!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Has 31% of His $8.7 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "There's little question that one of the driving forces behind the ongoing bull market is the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and the poster child for that shifting paradigm is Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computational horsepower needed for AI and have quickly become the gold standard. As a result, Nvidia continues to deliver quarter after quarter of record-setting results, which has sent its stock price soaring.\n\nHowever, some investors are concerned that growing competition and the stock's lofty valuation make Nvidia increasingly risky. Consequently, these same investors are looking for other ways to profit from the AI revolution. One place to look for other ideas is among the holdings of successful hedge fund managers.\n\nOne such money manager is Daniel Loeb. The billionaire heads up Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb turned seed money of just $3.4 billion -- raised from family and friends -- into a financial empire with assets under management of $12 billion.\n\nLoeb has left no doubt about the potential implications of AI, calling it \"transformational\" and ultimately sparking a \"profound economic upheaval.\" In fact, the famed investor is so bullish about AI that it's the \"key element of the thesis for nearly half\" the hedge funds stock holdings. Just four stocks make up his largest AI investments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.4% of holdings\n\nThird Point's largest AI holding -- and largest position overall -- is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that he has held continuously since 2019. He notes that AI favors incumbents like Amazon \"who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race.\"\n\nHe's clearly done his homework. Amazon quickly positioned itself to capitalize on the AI opportunity, offering a roster of the most in-demand AI models to its cloud customers, while also creating its own, but that's just the beginning. Amazon is using AI to identify and store inventory 75% more quickly while bringing down order processing times by 25%, giving its legacy online retail business a boost. The company also uses AI to better address the target audience for its digital ads.\n\nLoeb's Amazon position remained unchanged in the second quarter, with a total stake of 5.1 million shares worth about $986 million and nearly 11% of Third Point's portfolio. And at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is an attractively priced way to play the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a longtime Amazon shareholder, I'm completely on board with Loeb. Not only is Amazon the leading provider of e-commerce and cloud computing, but it's also a growing power player in digital advertising. Adding AI into the mix gives Amazon another way to win when the odds are already stacked in its favor.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nThird Point's second-largest AI holding and third-largest overall is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Loeb views the software giant as one of the \"best-run legacy\" companies, which has \"built enormous competitive advantages\" and is well positioned to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nHis logic is irrefutable. Like Amazon, Microsoft offers a wealth of AI models to cloud customers. However, the company's biggest AI opportunity is likely Copilot, Microsoft's suite of AI-powered digital assistants. Designed for a variety of industries and tasks, Copilot can streamline tasks and automate time-consuming chores, thereby increasing productivity. Demand for Copilot has been robust and has also helped boost the adoption of its cloud services. Microsoft's noted in the calendar second quarter that eight points of Azure Cloud's growth were the result of AI services.\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 11% in the second quarter, likely to expand its exposure to other AI stocks (more on that shortly).\n\nMicrosoft stock is selling for a premium at 38 times earnings. However, the company's strong legacy businesses and early positioning in AI show it's deserving of a premium.\n\nI'm a firm believer that Microsoft has a long runway ahead. Generative AI will continue to evolve and Copilot is an early mover in the space. When added to the company's existing businesses, AI gives Microsoft an extraordinary competitive advantage -- which is why I own the stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nLoeb's third largest AI holding and fourth overall is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Loeb hasn't been as vocal about his position in the tech giant but is likely bullish on the recovery in digital advertising, as targeted ads on its social media platforms generate 98% of its revenue. However, Meta also made a surprising move to capitalize on AI, which likely also informed Loeb's decision.\n\nMeta moved into AI contention by quickly developing its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), an AI model that is carried by all the major cloud platforms for a fee. This AI system is fueled by a treasure trove of data from the billions of users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger. AI is a new revenue stream for Meta, so we don't yet know how lucrative it might ultimately be.\n\nThird Point's stake in Meta amounts to 1.1 million shares worth roughly $555 million. Similar to Microsoft, Loeb trimmed his position in the second quarter by about 11%, likely to spread his AI bets (more on this below).\n\nThe stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nI'm equally bullish on Meta Platforms. I think the company's move to leverage its user data to create AI models was nothing short of brilliant. Add to that Meta's ever-expanding advertising prowess and you have the recipe for long-term success.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Apple -- 4.7% of holdings\n\nThere was a notable addition to Third Point's portfolio last quarter, that of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Loeb loaded up, acquiring nearly 2 million shares of the iPhone maker in a stake valued at roughly $411 million and representing nearly 5% of his portfolio.\n\nLoeb noted that while some investors fear Apple may \"be an AI loser,\" he takes a different view. He cited the company's 2.2 billion devices and wide selection of electronic devices as an advantage and believes \" AI-related demand could drive a step-change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.\" He further suggests that the company's recently announced Apple Intelligence -- a suite of AI-powered smartphone features -- will drive \"meaningful demand\" from Apple's installed base.\n\nInvestor sentiment has weighed on Apple stock since early last year, as some fear that AI had left the company behind, but I think that view is myopic. Apple has a long history of taking the time to put its unique stamp on its products and services, which has helped make it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Investors who dismiss Apple do so at their own peril.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nI own all four of these AI-centric stocks and believe they're all worth owning, but two stand out, albeit for different reasons.\n\nSince generative AI kicked off in earnest early last year, Apple stock has gained just 62%, the lowest among our quartet of stocks. Investors are waiting to see what the iPhone maker will unveils during its next product update on September 9. This could be the catalyst Apple needs to send its shares higher.\n\nStrictly from a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms remains the most attractively priced, at less than 26 times earnings, compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nThat said, each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity in the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That Created Many Millionaires and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "One of the coolest parts about investing is that there are a variety of ways to reach your goal. It doesn't matter whether you prefer high-flying growth stocks or slow and steady dividend stocks; you can build wealth with almost any strategy. The most important thing is buying stocks representing high-quality companies. A quality business steadily grows and creates value for its shareholders, making you wealthy over time.\n\nOne stumbling block for this investing strategy is the propensity to overthink investing. Overthinking can sometimes cause investors to pass on proven winners to instead focus on riskier stocks that might be successful.\n\nHere are three magnificent stocks that have made people rich and have the ingredients to do it for you as well.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nE-commerce and technology company Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the textbook example of a millionaire-making stock. Its shares have returned over 179,000% since its IPO in 1997. How? By dominating colossal market opportunities. Amazon started as an online bookstore in the earliest days of e-commerce. Today, Amazon sells virtually anything you could think of and controls almost 40% of online sales in the United States. However, Amazon didn't stop there; its innovative culture led it to sell its IT infrastructure to the public as AWS, the world's leading cloud platform today. Roughly 200 million households subscribe to Amazon's monthly Prime membership, which it has used to build growing businesses in advertising and streaming entertainment content.\n\nAmazon's massive size gives it cost advantages against most competitors across its business models. Additionally, these various businesses have room to keep growing for the foreseeable future. For example, online shopping is still just 16% of total retail sales in America. Meanwhile, global cloud infrastructure spending is poised to grow by nearly 20% annually over the coming years on cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) demand.\n\nAnalysts believe the company's earnings will increase by 27% annually over the long term, which means this multitrillion-dollar company should continue compounding wealth for those holding the stock.\n\n2. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nSuccessful companies are frequently boring; Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) sells burritos and rice bowls to hungry customers. Yet, the stock has appreciated over 6,000% since going public in 2006. Chipotle's fresh and popular products have fueled steady store expansion for three decades. Today, the company owns and operates roughly 3,146 stores (primarily) in the United States and international markets like Canada and the United Kingdom. The company splits its profits between opening stores and repurchasing its stock to help boost earnings per share, ultimately helping drive its share price higher. Chipotle has reduced its share count by nearly 12% over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe great thing about a business like this is that it's predictable. Chipotle shouldn't have any problems continuing its success as long as people still enjoy its food. More mature restaurant chains have thousands more stores, meaning Chipotle can continue opening stores for years. Its Tex-Mex cuisine is also popular worldwide, so international markets could play a more significant role in Chipotle's growth as its footprint in the U.S. market matures. Analysts believe Chipotle can grow earnings by 22% annually moving forward, so there is still plenty of upside ahead for long-term investors.\n\n3. Coca-Cola\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is a Warren Buffett favorite and bona fide wealth-building machine. Coca-Cola doesn't grow fast, but the slow and steady winner has returned over 12,000% in total gains to investors since the early 1970s. The company sells dozens of brands of soda, water, juices, tea, and other beverages worldwide through grocery stores, vending machines, restaurants, and just about anywhere you might find a drink. Coca-Cola is highly profitable, so it shares its profits with investors via dividends. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years. Want to get the most out of Coca-Cola stock? Buy, hold, and reinvest those dividends to buy more shares.\n\nIt's a boring company, but you might regret passing on it. Although Coca-Cola is not fast-growing, it still has a tremendous runway for long-term expansion. The beverage industry is so fragmented that an estimated 70% of consumers in developed countries still don't drink a Coca-Cola product more than once a week. The penetration is even lower in emerging markets like Africa, India, and Latin America. Coca-Cola's brands are known worldwide, so the company should tap into that growth as economies mature and consumers have the discretionary income for things like packaged beverages. Analysts believe Coca-Cola will grow earnings by 6% annually over the long term, adding to the stock's nearly 3% dividend yield.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive-Amazon turns to Anthropic's Claude for Alexa AI revamp",
        "content": "By Greg Bensinger\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon's revamped Alexa due for release in October ahead of the U.S. holiday season will be powered primarily by Anthropic's Claude artificial intelligence models, rather than its own AI, five people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nAmazon plans to charge $5 to $10 a month for its new \"Remarkable\" version of Alexa as it will use powerful generative AI to answer complex queries, while still offering the \"Classic\" voice assistant for free, Reuters reported in June.\n\nBut initial versions of the new Alexa using in-house software simply struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply, one of the people said.\n\nThat's why Amazon turned to Claude, an AI chatbot developed by startup Anthropic, as it performed better than the online retail giant's own AI models, the people said.\n\nReuters based this story upon interviews with five people with direct knowledge of the Alexa strategy. All declined to be named as they are not authorized to discuss non-public matters.\n\nAlexa, accessed mainly through Amazon televisions and Echo devices, can set timers, play music, act as a central hub for smart home controls and answer one-off questions.\n\nBut Amazon's attempts to convince users to shop through Alexa to generate more revenue have been mostly unsuccessful and the division remains unprofitable.\n\nAs a result, senior management has stressed that 2024 is a critical year for Alexa to finally demonstrate it can generate meaningful sales - and the revamped paid version is seen as a way both to do that and keep pace with rivals.\n\n\"Amazon uses many different technologies to power Alexa,\" a company spokeswoman said in a statement in response to detailed Reuters questions for this story.\n\n\"When it comes to machine learning models, we start with those built by Amazon, but we have used, and will continue to use, a variety of different models - including (Amazon AI model) Titan and future Amazon models, as well as those from partners - to build the best experience for customers,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nAnthropic, in which Amazon owns a minority stake, declined to comment for this story.\n\nAI PARTNERSHIPS\n\nAmazon has typically eschewed relying on technology it hasn't developed in-house so it can ensure it has full control of the user experience, data collection and direct relationships with customers.\n\nBut it would not be alone in turning to a partner to improve AI products. Microsoft and Apple, for example, have both struck partnerships with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT to power some of their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe release of the Remarkable Alexa, as it is known internally, is expected in October, with a preview of the new service coming during Amazon's annual devices and services event typically held in September, the people said.\n\nAmazon has not yet said, however, when it plans to hold its showcase event, which will be the first major public appearance of its new devices chief, Panos Panay, who was hired last year to replace long-time executive David Limp.\n\nThe wide release in late 2022 of ChatGPT, which gives full-sentence answers almost instantaneously to complicated queries, set off a frenzy of investing and corporate maneuvering to develop better AI software for a variety of functions, including image, video and voice services.\n\nBy comparison, Amazon's decade-old Alexa appeared outmoded, Amazon workers have told Reuters.\n\nWhile Amazon has a mantra of \"working backwards from the customer\" to come up with new services, some of the people said that within the Alexa group, the emphasis since last year has instead been on keeping up with competitors in the AI race.\n\nAmazon workers also have expressed skepticism that customers would be willing to pay $60 to $120 per year for a service that's free today - on top of the $139 many already pay for their Prime memberships.\n\nALEXA UPGRADES\n\nAs envisioned, the paid version of Alexa would carry on conversations with a user that build on prior questions and answers, the people with knowledge of the Alexa strategy said.\n\nThe upgraded Alexa is designed to allow users to seek shopping advice such as which clothes to buy for a vacation and to aggregate news stories, the people said. And it is meant to carry out more complicated requests, such as ordering food or drafting emails all from a single prompt.\n\nAmazon hopes the new Alexa will also be a supercharged home automation hub, remembering customer preferences so that, say, morning alarms are set, or the television knows to record favorite shows even when a user forgets to, they said.\n\nThe company's plans for Alexa, however, could be delayed or altered if the technology fails to meet certain internal benchmarks, the people said, without giving further details.\n\nBank of America analyst Justin Post estimated in June that there are roughly 100 million active Alexa users and that about 10% of those might opt for the paid version of Alexa. Assuming the low end of the monthly price range, that would bring in at least $600 million in annual sales.\n\nAmazon says it has sold 500 million Alexa-enabled devices but does not disclose how many active users there are.\n\nAnnouncing a deal to invest $4 billion in Anthropic in September last year, Amazon said its customers would gain early access to its technology. Reuters could not determine if Amazon would have to pay Anthropic additionally for the use of Claude in Alexa.\n\nAmazon declined to discuss the details of its agreements with the startup. Alphabet's Google has also invested at least $2 billion in Anthropic.\n\nThe retailer, along with Google, is facing a formal probe from the UK's antitrust regulator over the Anthropic deal and its impact on competition. It announced an initial investigation in August and said it has 40 working days to decide whether to move it to a more heightened stage of scrutiny.\n\nThe Washington Post earlier reported the October time frame for release of the new Alexa.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Kenneth Li and David Clarke)",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

        "title": "Nvidia investors should've sold the stock a month ago, strategist says",
        "content": "One Nvidia (NVDA) bear warned the time has come for investors to sell.\n\nNvidia failed to meet sky-high expectations when it reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday. Nvidia reported profits and revenue that topped forecasts but not by as much as investors hoped, delivering its smallest earnings beat in the last six quarters.\n\nNvidia stock fell 6% on Wednesday evening in reaction to the results and continued to slide 4% lower on Thursday afternoon. Year to date, the stock remains up nearly 140%.\n\nWhen asked when it might be time to sell, David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of Bahnsen Group, said, \"About a month ago. Two months ago. Today. Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"People are paying for perfection,\" Bahnsen added (video above). \"You're buying Nvidia banking on there being another investor who's a bigger sucker than you are.\"\n\nThe warning from Bahnsen comes as the stock has rallied 1,000% from its October 2022 lows. His call is based on one data point: Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio, which sits just above 56 after earnings but neared 80 in July.\n\nHe offered a reminder that a company and its stock are not the same thing.\n\n\"This is not me bashing on Nvidia,\" Bahnsen said. \"This is a success story. I'm commenting on the valuation — that when you start paying those prices, the risk-reward skew becomes very unattractive.\"\n\nStill, it’s a risk that the 89% of analysts with a Buy rating on the stock are willing to take. The stock has zero Sell ratings, which is understandable considering Nvidia posted $30 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 122% increase over the same period last year.\n\nNvidia's future depends in part on other Big Tech companies. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) are responsible for 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai indicated on the company’s earnings call this quarter that the company's spending on artificial intelligence would not slow down. “The one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,” Pichai said. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang waves to the audience at a keynote presentation at COMPUTEX. (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlphabet's investment in AI, which represents a significant portion of Nvidia’s revenue, could be a bullish signal to come. But those business fundamentals aren’t the only focus.\n\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next big question for investors is whether the Street’s reaction to Nvidia results this quarter will be enough to dampen earnings expectations heading into Q3.\n\nFor Bahnsen, it may already be too late.

        "title": "Controversial California bill to prevent AI disasters heads to Newsom despite pushback from Big Tech",
        "content": "California lawmakers passed a sweeping artificial intelligence bill, SB 1047, that seeks to establish safeguards for tech firms developing large AI models. If signed into law, SB 1047 would dramatically alter the way top AI firms operate, leading to pushback from prominent players like OpenAI, Meta (META), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom has not indicated whether he plans to veto SB 1047.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on Wednesday, Salesforce (CRM) CEO Mark Benioff weighed in on the importance of regulation. \"Looking at AI safety it has to be the highest of everybody’s interest to make sure that these AI models do not get out of control,\" Benioff said.\n\n\"And I think that these kinds of ideas are incredibly interesting and need to be fully evaluated. And it’s worthwhile.\"\n\nDemocratic state senator Scott Wiener, who co-authored the bill, says the bill codifies voluntary safety evaluations that large AI labs, such as Meta, have already committed to. The bill requires developers spending over $100 million to build an AI model to perform safety testing before releasing it. They are required to mitigate the risks if testing found the model has the potential to cause \"catastrophic harm.\"\n\nSupporters of the bill, including the 'Godfathers of AI,' Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, say the regulation is crucial to addressing potential harms posed by AI models. They say the government has not done enough to address the threat.\n\n“SB 1047 is a much-needed step towards advancing both safety and long-term innovation in the AI ecosystem, especially incentivizing research and development in AI safety,\" Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal, told Yahoo Finance. California's artificial intelligence bill - SB1047.\n\nTesla (TSLA) chief Elon Musk, who also owns xAI, voiced his support this week on X this week, but said it was a \"tough call.\"\n\n\"I think California should probably pass the SB 1047 AI safety bill. For over 20 years, I have been an advocate for AI regulation, just as we regulate any product/technology that is a potential risk to the public,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk has previously urged AI labs to pause the development of systems that can't compete with human-level intelligence, citing potential risks to society. However, he's also been highly critical of state officials in California.\n\nSB 1047 is co-sponsored by the Center for AI Safety Action Fund, Economic Security California Action and Encode Justice. “It is long past due that we hold Big Tech accountable for their outsized influence and unchecked power,” Teri Olle, Director of Economic Security California Action, said on the assembly floor.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We need legislative solutions like SB 1047 to flip the script and ensure the public can decide how critical technology benefits society as a whole.”\n\nA poll released this week by the Artificial Intelligence Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe AI development, found that 7 out of ten Californians support the bill and over 60% of respondents said they would partially blame Gov. Newsom for future AI-related incidents if he vetoes it.\n\nWiener's longtime ally, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, announced that she's against the bill. “I share your desire that AI develops in a safe and sustainable way, and I agree with the overall intention of your legislation,” Breed wrote in a letter to Wiener. “With additional time and collaboration, I am confident we can find a solution that addresses many of the concerns raised in recent months, while still enabling this emerging field to grow in a safe and sustainable way.”\n\nBreed joins a growing list of California Democrats in Congress who oppose the measure including: former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reps. Ro Khanna, Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, Scott Peters, Tony Cárdenas, Ami Bera, Nanette Diaz Barragan, and Lou Correa.\n\nThe bill was amended several times to assuage the fears of AI opponents including Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Some of the major amendments include: removing the state regulatory body formerly called the Frontier Model Division, and removing criminal penalties while civil penalties remain.\n\nAdditionally, if an open-source developer spends less than $10 million fine-tuning an existing model, the liability would rest with the model's original developer. The Attorney General's ability to seek civil penalties has been amended to only if \"a harm has occured or there is an imminent threat to public safety.\"\n\nGovernor Newsom has until September 30 to sign or veto the bill. When asked whether he's confident it will become law, Wiener said: \"the governor has made statements that are very consistent with my own thinking — that regulation could be appropriate here and we want to make sure we’re fostering innovation as well.”\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 16 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nIn recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\n\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): High AI Spending In Focus on Wall Street\n\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Investor concerns around the stock have been mounting in the past few weeks, mainly due to weaker-than-expected revenue growth projections and continued high spending, mostly on AI and cloud infrastructure. The forward guidance on revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates in the latest quarter despite a 12% rise in total sales and higher-than-expected profits for the second quarter. This has led to concerns about slower growth in the coming quarters. The significant capital expenditures, in part on the development of AI capabilities, have also raised worries about the impact on short-term profitability.\n\nPerhaps these are some of the reasons why Wells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\n\nOverall, AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "The biggest challenge for Nvidia stock in one chart",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) growth metrics aren't impressing Wall Street like they used to.\n\nNvidia reported earnings on Wednesday which showed the company's earnings and revenue grew more than 100% from the prior year. But it also marked the company's slowest year-over-year revenue growth, 122%, in a year, and the rate of growth compared to the prior year was less than half what Nvidia reported in the first two calendar quarters of 2024.\n\nShares were down as much as 3.5% early Thursday morning.\n\nAnd this growth slowdown, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, is the chief concern with the stock right now and why he maintains a Neutral rating on the AI juggernaut.\n\n\"Next year we're going to have, at the very least, decelerating growth and possibly at some point, revenue declines,\" Luria said.\n\n\"Where if you look at consensus estimates, sell-side estimates, they are for the growth to continue at very, very high rates that are very hard to justify considering Nvidia's revenue is these other companies margins.\"\n\nAt some point, Luria argued, the big tech hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are going to slow their spending. And given they represent the lion's share of Nvidia's current AI chip sales, that'd likely be a headwind to future revenue growth.\n\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" Luria said.\n\nNvidia's earnings call was still rather upbeat. CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for the AI leader's new Blackwell chip as \"incredible.\" And plenty of Wall Street analysts remained bullish on the stock as fears about delays on the Blackwell chip were somewhat eased during the earnings call.\n\nBut for investors assessing a stock that has rallied more than 1000% since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, slowing growth appears to be a sticking point. As Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note to clients, Nvidia's guidance for current quarter revenue of $32.5 billion — plus or minus 2% — appeared to be \"good but not good enough.\"\n\nNvidia's results also didn't surprise Wall Street at the same pace that they had been.\n\nThe company posted its slimmest upside surprise to Wall Street's revenue expectations since the start of 2023. Its roughly 5% beat on earnings per share was the narrowest surprise since before the AI revolution kicked off in 2023, too.\n\n\"The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing,\" Carson Group chief markets strategist, Ryan Detrick wrote in reaction to the earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.” A smartphone with a displayed NVIDIA logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023.

        "content": "Amazon Moves Forward With Satellite Internet Ambitions, Secures New Zealand Land for Project Kuiper\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) bagged regulatory permission in July to buy a 500-square-meter site in New Zealand for Project Kuiper.\n\nAmazon proposes to install and operate telecommunications equipment on the land to cater to its New Zealand customers, Bloomberg cites the Overseas Investment Office in Wellington.\n\nProject Kuiper is Amazon’s initiative to develop a large-scale satellite broadband constellation that will provide reliable, affordable Internet service to underserved communities worldwide.\n\nThis project is part of a broader movement involving several companies planning to launch satellite constellations to offer global broadband internet coverage.\n\nAmazon’s Project Kuiper aims to offer broadband internet from a constellation of more than 3,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, mirroring Elon Musk’s Starlink.\n\nThe financial terms of the land acquisition were not disclosed.\n\nIt aims to launch its satellites before the end of 2024 and start the first customer tests in 2025, with a commercial service to follow later in the year. However, challenges loom in balancing affordability and service quality.\n\nIn June, Amazon’s Project Kuiper collaborated with DIRECTV Latin America parent Vrio Corp to offer satellite broadband in seven South American countries.\n\nIn August, Amazon reported 10% second-quarter topline growth, reaching $148 billion but trailing the analyst consensus estimate of $148.56 billion.\n\nAmazon stock gained 27% in the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nWhen buying a stock for a longer time horizon, it is important for investors to assess where they think the stock is headed in the future.\n\nWhen mapping a stock's future trajectory, investors should consider factors including the future earnings expectations and expected performance against a benchmark.\n\nAmazon.com's revenue has grown at an average rate of 17.61% annually over the past 5 years. The average 1-year price target from analysts is $223.06, representing an expected 30.6% upside in 2025.\n\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, investors should also look at a stock's historical performance when compared to both a benchmark index and the company's peers. Shares of Amazon.com have seen an annualized return of -0.05%, underperforming the S&P500 index by 7.33%. This compares to 0.99% growth in the overall Consumer Discretionary sector.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Just Loaded Up on Stocks: 6 Companies She Just Bought",
        "content": "Like the temperature throughout August, the stock buying activity of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, has stayed hot over the past few weeks. According to a recently submitted regulatory filing, Greene, who sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, added shares of six stocks to her portfolio.\n\nIn this round of stock purchasing, Greene increased her exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Greene also scooped up shares of logistics leader FedEx(NYSE: FDX) and pipeline operator KinderMorgan(NYSE: KMI). It's not certain how much Greene invested in each of the stocks, though each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nThe Peach State representative's interest in AI stocks remains strong\n\nThrough the first half of 2024, Greene added a variety of AI stocks to her holdings, and her enthusiasm for the rapidly growing industry has hardly slowed. Although we don't know the exact reason why Greene clicked the buy button on Alphabet, it's possible that she sense a bargain. Over the one-month period that preceded her purchase, shares of Alphabet had dropped nearly 7%. Addressing the boon that AI has represented for the company's financials, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, stated on the Q2 2024 conference call, \"Year to date, our AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues, and are being used by more than 2 million developers.\"\n\nGreene's investment in Amazon provides her with another layer of AI exposure. The company is recognizing strong growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business as customers turn to it for support with the heavy computing demands stemming from generative AI. Through the first half of 2024, AWS revenue and operating income has grown 18% and 79%, respectively. Amazon has exposure to AI in a variety of other ways, including its $4 billion investment in Anthropic.\n\nAdding to her positions in semiconductor stocks like Qualcomm and ASML, Greene bought shares of Intel and Nvidia, broadening her AI exposure. As with Alphabet, Greene may have sensed, with Intel, the opportunity to pick up a prominent AI stock while it was in the bargain bin. For the month before her purchase, Intel stock had plunged about 35%. In addition to reporting disappointing Q2 2024 financial results, Intel announced that it was suspending its dividend to the chagrin of investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia stock rounds out Greene's AI stock acquisitions. The semiconductor stalwart continues to dominate the AI scene, and it's little surprise that Greene picked up the stock considering her enthusiasm for other AI names. Besides its robust financial health, Nvidia has tremendous growth prospects, making it an obvious consideration for conservative and growth investors alike who are AI-minded.\n\nNo stranger to logistics leaders, Greene bought shares of FedEx, following up on her purchase of United Parcel Service stock earlier this month. Reporting fiscal 2024 financial results in June, FedEx grew both revenue and adjusted EPS about 1% and 9.5%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2023. The company projects low- to mid-single-digit growth for revenue in fiscal 2025 and adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 24%. Plus, the stock's 1.9% forward dividend yield certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nPerhaps interested in procuring more prodigious passive income, Greene added to her position in Kinder Morgan, the largest energy infrastructure stock in the S&P 500. Operating about 66,000 miles of natural gas pipeline and about 9,500 miles of refined products and crude pipelines through the United States, Kinder Morgan is a leading energy stock that is dedicated to rewarding shareholders. Currently, Kinder Morgan stock offers a forward dividend yield of about 5.4%.\n\nShould I buy these stocks?\n\nWhile it's worth noting politicians' stock picks, smart investors know that it's unwise to blindly follow their buys. Instead, it's more prudent to perform one's own due diligence and investigate potential stock picks thoroughly.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia, for instance, are all compelling AI investment opportunities. Intel, on the other hand, may seem interesting to those with long-term investing horizons who can wait for the company to implement their cost-reduction initiatives yet not as appealing to conservative investors looking to mitigate risk.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their passive income streams, both FedEx and Kinder Morgan are both excellent options providing exposure to the logistics and energy industries, respectively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares in chip company Nvidia fell in after-hours trading, following second quarter earnings which showed the smallest revenue beat in six quarters.\n\nNvidia was down nearly 7% in pre-market trading, despite the chipmaker reporting second quarter figures that beat expectations on the top and bottom line after the US bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe company, a world leader in chip design and software, reported revenues of $30bn (£22.7bn) in its fiscal second quarter, compared to analysts' forecasts of $28.8bn.\n\nBen Barringer, technology and media analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nvidia has grown to a point where there is little room for error and any sign of slowing or normalisation of growth will have an outsized effect on the share price.”\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks higher as Nvidia shares fall despite record sales\n\n“This being the smallest beat in six quarters, and the fact guidance for gross margins and costs are weaker was enough to get people to hit the sell button in after hours trading.”\n\nTech stocks led US markets lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the highly-anticipated results, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closing 1.1% down.\n\nSalesforce (CRM)\n\nSoftware company Salesforce posted second quarter results after the US market close on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins and earnings.\n\nSalesforce posted net sales of $9.33bn for the second quarter, above an estimate of $9.23bn.\n\nShares popped in after-hours trading, up 5%.\n\nSales increased 11% in Europe, 16% in Asia-Pacific, and 8% in its Americas segment in the second quarter. This marked a turnaround from the previous quarter when the company posted its first sales estimate miss since 2006.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin,” Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also reported an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, coming in above estimates of 31.94%.\n\n“Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history,\" Miner said.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n\nShares in Warren Buffet’s company were trending in pre-market trading as it hit $1tn (£756bn) in market value — the first US company outside of the tech sector to reach the milestone.\n\nThe $1tn threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffet turns 94 years old.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway comprises a $285bn stock portfolio that Buffett has built up over six decades, making him one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn recent months, Berkshire Hathaway has been in selling mode. It cut its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 50% last quarter. On Tuesday, the company disclosed it had sold nearly 25 million Bank of America (BAC) shares worth close to $1bn.\n\nRead more: The top FTSE 100 winners and losers of 2024 so far\n\nBerkshire’s insurance, energy, manufacturing, retail and service businesses generated $22.8bn of profit in the first half of the year, up 26% from a year earlier.\n\nTopping the list of the most valuable companies are Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), which all are worth more than $3tn. Other companies trading above $1tn include Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nShares in the AI server maker were almost 7% lower in pre-market trading after plunging over 19% during Wednesday’s session after it said it would delay the filing of its annual report.\n\n″SMCI is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense,” the company said. “Additional time is needed for SMCI’s management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of 30 June 2024.”\n\nThat announcement came a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report that alleged it found “glaring accounting red flags” and other issues at the company.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said some of Hindenburg’s claims are “tough to verify” and that the report is “largely void of details around alleged wrong doings from the company”.\n\nHindenburg Research said its three-month investigation found \"evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues\". The firm disclosed on Tuesday that it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Stock to Buy According to Hosking Partners?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of  15 Best Stocks to Buy According to Hosking Partners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Hosking Partners.\n\nHosking Partners was established in 2013 by Jeremy Hosking as an independent partnership that offers a single global equity strategy. The firm appeals to investors seeking long-term returns and innovative thinking employing a capital cycle approach to investing. It has a diverse set of stocks in its portfolio that belong to a variety of industries consisting of AI, shipping, and financial services, among others. Jeremy Hosking earned an MA from the University of Cambridge, after which he served Marathon Asset Management 26 years as a founding partner and lead portfolio manager. There he contributed to developing the capital cycle approach to investment.\n\nIn its recent blog about shipping, Hosking Partners believes that understanding the cycles in different classes of shipping and global trends is essential for successful investment in the industry. Currently, Shipping (covering the container, dry bulk, product tanker and LNG sub-sectors) represents 1.25% of the portfolio. Global trade has declined as a percentage of GDP since 2010 caused by deglobalization, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability from the Russia-Ukraine war. This trend, coupled with the energy transition, is expected to constrain future supply and increase commodity price volatility, benefiting shipping by enabling cross-border trade.\n\nFurthermore, shipping is a significant emitter of CO2, accounting for about 3% of global emissions. Environmental regulations aim to reduce emissions, but uncertainty over future fuel technology deters investment in new ships, leading to a tighter supply. The industry’s efficiency, measured by emissions per tonne-km, remains high compared to other transport modes. The shipping industry is at a pivotal juncture, with significant transformations driven by AI, the energy transition, and ESG considerations.\n\nAnother industry that Hosking Partners talks about is copper mining. Copper is often seen as a barometer for economic health and is crucial for the energy transition, including electric vehicles, power grids, and wind turbines. Wall Street banks are optimistic about copper prices, forecasting significant gains. Citi analysts suggest that prices could surge to over $15,000 per ton in the next 2-3 years if a strong economic recovery occurs, while their base case projects a rise to $12,000 per ton with modest demand growth through 2025 and 2026. Bank of America has also increased its 2024 copper price target to $9,321 from $8,625, citing tight mine supply and high demand driven by the energy transition as key factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, some experts are cautious. Colin Hamilton of BMO Capital Markets argues that commodity markets tend to self-correct, and if supply issues persist, demand may adjust, potentially leading to lower prices. Hamilton suggests that while high price targets might be temporarily achievable, adjustments in demand could follow. The market may see a modest surplus due to increased mined supply, which is projected to grow by 4-4.5%. This is largely driven by new greenfield and brownfield projects. Despite the near-term surplus, long-term scarcity is anticipated as regulatory and political challenges in South America could impede the development of new mines.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Best Stock to Buy According to Hosking Partners?\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nHosking Partners’ Stake Value: $93,446,617\n\nPercentage of Hosking Partners’ 13F Portfolio: 3.45%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is strengthening its leadership in AI, driven by its AWS business, which achieved over 37% operating margins in Q1 and has consistently exceeded 30% for the past five quarters. Amazon’s first-quarter revenue grew by 12.5% year-over-year, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon with a price target of $240, following an analysis of the U.S. e-commerce market. The research indicates that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with long-term e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40%.\n\nThis stock is highly favored by customers due to its extensive diversification in AI and cloud computing, making its products and services top choices among cloud users. During Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q2 2024 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the rapid growth of the company’s AI business, driven by Amazon’s belief that no single AI tool can dominate the market. As a result, Amazon offers a wide range of AI tools, ensuring that developers and consumers can find the best fit for their needs.\n\nThe company’s impressive growth and rising investor interest are also fueled by the profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. The increasing demand for AWS, particularly due to Amazon’s investments in generative AI projects, led to an 18.8% year-over-year increase in AWS revenue in the second quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of  the best stocks to buy according to Hosking Partners. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Amazon Alexa the Best AI Assistant in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon Alexa stands against the other AI assistants.\n\nAs we have mentioned in our article, “10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1,\" the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.\n\nRegionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.\n\nWith the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that \"AI is not a passing fad.\" In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.\n\nIf 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.\n\nAnother study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, \"Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution,\" examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to \"augment\" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon Alexa\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 14\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AI virtual speech assistant service, Alexa, is accessible on over 100 million devices made by Amazon and other manufacturers. It's intended to assist consumers in purchasing Amazon things, playing music, and controlling smart home gadgets (Echo). Many IoT devices and Amazon items come pre-installed with it. The Echo Show 8 is the most recent Alexa show device.\n\nIn its May 2024 investor letter, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund provided an update on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), sharing their analysis and perspective on the company’s performance and future prospects:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Google revamps controversial AI image generation tool after backlash",
        "content": "After Google pulled the ability for its AI chatbot to generate images of people, the search giant is reintroducing the feature following a high profile backlash.\n\nGoogle on Wednesday said that it will start to roll out an updated image generation tool for users of the English-language version its AI chatbot, Gemini Advanced. The service will also feature Google's latest image generation model, Imagen 3.\n\nIn February, Google disabled the ability of users to generate images of humans after the company acknowledged that its tool would \"overcompensate\" in seeking to depict diverse ranges of people, even in unrealistic or absurd scenarios. The episode highlighted the company's scramble to get it on the AI frenzy, and the risks of releasing new technology without rigorous vetting.\n\nA social media firestorm drew attention to images that, for example, depicted a Black woman as a US founding father and showed Black and Asian people as Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nSome users wielded the results as evidence of an anti-white bias in what the tool generated.\n\nThe viral images sparked criticism from prominent figures, including X owner Elon Musk, who has previously criticized the perceived liberal bias of AI tools. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff at the time that some of the faulty responses were unacceptable, and that \"we got it wrong.\"\n\n\"With Imagen 3, we’ve made significant progress in providing a better user experience when generating images of people,\" said Dave Citron, a senior director at Google, in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nThe reintroduction is the latest development in Google's AI rollouts, which have been uneven at times.\n\nLast year, Google fumbled the release of its initial AI chatbot Bard, when it spit out inaccurate responses during a promotional video.\n\nTaken together, the episodes underscored the perceived sloppiness of the launches and undermined Google's credibility, just as tech giants were jostling for position amid the AI hype. Google said it has upgraded its creative image generation capabilities and will bring its latest image generation model, Imagen 3 to Gemini Apps (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn an effort to prevent abuse, the tool won't support the generation of photorealistic scenes of identifiable individuals, minors or excessive violence, Citron said.\n\n\"Of course, as with any generative AI tool, not every image Gemini creates will be perfect, but we’ll continue to listen to feedback from early users as we keep improving. We'll gradually roll this out, aiming to bring it to more users and languages soon.\"\n\nGoogle's re-release comes at a fraught moment in the AI world.\n\nIn the months since the search giant originally released and pulled the tool, investors have wavered in their support of AI investments. Recent market volatility has resurfaced questions about the valuations of tech companies which have thrown enormous resources behind ambitious AI buildouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe competitive landscape has also changed.\n\nWhile Google was previously seen as playing catchup to Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has since joined the Big Tech AI party. And while the iPhone maker's rivals were dealing with boardroom drama and public backlash over AI developments, Wall Street has applauded Apple's efforts, highlighting the company's success at marketing AI tools in ways that other tech giants have struggled through.\n\nGoogle's reintroduction of the image generation feature also came just ahead of a pivotal earnings release from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of the AI chip designer are up about 160% so far this year. And AI bulls view a potential blowout report as the next catalyst in what has been a challenging market for chips and AI companies.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "AWS Parallel Computing Service is Now Generally Available, Designed to Accelerate Scientific Discovery",
        "content": "New service allows customers who build scientific and engineering models to quickly and easily set up and manage high performance computing infrastructure to accelerate R&D at scale\n\nMarvel Fusion, Maxar, RONIN, and The National Renewable Energy Laboratory among the first customers and partners to use AWS Parallel Computing Service\n\nSEATTLE, August 28, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the general availability of AWS Parallel Computing Service, a new managed service that helps customers easily set up and manage high performance computing (HPC) clusters so they can run scientific and engineering workloads at virtually any scale on AWS. The service makes it easy for system administrators to build clusters using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, low-latency networking, and storage optimized for HPC workloads. With AWS Parallel Computing Service, scientists and engineers can quickly scale simulations to validate models and designs, while system administrators and integrators can build and maintain HPC clusters on AWS using Slurm, the most popular open-source HPC workload manager. This service accelerates innovation in areas such as fast-tracking drug discovery, uncovering genomic insights, building engineering designs, running weather applications, and building scientific and engineering models. To get started with AWS Parallel Computing Service, visit https://aws.amazon.com/pcs/.\n\nAWS has a history of innovation in supporting HPC workloads. That history includes releases like the open source cluster orchestration toolkit AWS ParallelCluster, fully managed batch computing service AWS Batch, low latency network interconnect Elastic Fabric Adapter, Amazon FSx for Lustre high performance storage, and dedicated AMD, Intel, and Graviton-based HPC compute instances, the latter delivering up to 65% better price-performance over comparable compute optimized x86-based instances. Thousands of customers from a wide range of industries have migrated their HPC workloads to AWS to fast-track drug discovery, uncover genomic insights, maximize energy resources, and spin up supercomputers with millions of cores. Today AWS continues our innovation in HPC by releasing a fully-managed and comprehensive HPC service, which removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of creating and managing HPC clusters.\n\nAWS Parallel Computing Service is a new managed service that helps customers easily set up and manage HPC so they can run scientific and engineering workloads at virtually any scale on AWS. With AWS Parallel Computing Service, system administrators can use familiar tools including AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK to deploy a managed Slurm environment. AWS Parallel Computing Service builds from open-source foundations that customers know and have experience with, and delivers a managed Slurm experience with the reliability and availability of AWS. AWS Parallel Computing Service significantly reduces the operational burden of managing a cluster and regularly delivers new capabilities and fixes through managed service updates with minimal to no downtime, eliminating the need to apply manual patches and rebuilding clusters to receive feature updates. Highly available APIs also help developers and ISVs create end-to-end HPC solutions on top of AWS, so they can focus on providing value-added features to their users and customers instead of worrying about managing infrastructure. AWS Parallel Computing Service enables customers of all sizes (e.g., startups, enterprises, or national labs) to easily create and manage HPC clusters with the scalability, reliability, and security of AWS. This means scientists and engineers using Slurm can easily migrate their existing on-premises workflows to AWS without re-architecting them—giving scientists and engineers access to cloud infrastructure that scales automatically. And administrators who want to unblock capacity or capability constraints for their end-users can spin up clusters in just minutes instead of months, to run their simulations to address the world’s most challenging problems.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Developing a cure for a catastrophic disease, designing novel materials, advancing renewable energy, and revolutionizing transportation are problems that we just can’t afford to have waiting in a queue,\" said Ian Colle, director, advanced compute and simulation at AWS. \"Managing HPC workloads, particularly the most complex and challenging extreme-scale workloads, is extraordinarily difficult. Our aim is that every scientist and engineer using AWS Parallel Computing Service, regardless of organization size, is the most productive person in their field because they have the same top-tier HPC capabilities as large enterprises to solve the world’s toughest challenges, any time they need to, and at any scale.\"\n\nTo get started, system administrators use the AWS Management Console to spin up a Slurm cluster securely and execute jobs in just a few clicks, compared to manual orchestration today. With CloudFormation support coming soon, customers will be able to build and deploy HPC clusters using infrastructure as code. AWS Parallel Computing Service is now available in the following Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo).\n\nMarvel Fusion is a Germany-based fusion energy startup pursuing the creation of unlimited zero-emission energy. \"We are excited that AWS Parallel Computing Service will deliver highly available and easy-to-upgrade HPC cluster management capabilities,\" said Moritz von der Linden, CEO of Marvel Fusion. \"It will empower our scientists and IT staff to take advantage of the latest AWS Parallel Computing Service capabilities in hours, instead of the weeks of planning and overhead previously needed.\"\n\nMaxar Intelligence provides secure, precise geospatial intelligence, enabling government and commercial customers to monitor, understand, and navigate our changing planet. \"As a long-time user of AWS HPC solutions, we were excited to test the service-driven approach from AWS Parallel Computing Service,\" said Travis Hartman, director of Weather and Climate at Maxar Intelligence. \"We found great potential for AWS Parallel Computing Service to bring better cluster visibility, compute provisioning, and service integration to Maxar Intelligence’s WeatherDesk platform, which would enable the team to make their time-sensitive HPC clusters more resilient and easier to manage.\"\n\nRONIN is an Australia-based software company whose flagship HPC service provides a simple, intuitive web interface for researchers and scientists from leading academic and research institutions to easily run HPC simulations on AWS. \"Democratizing HPC in the cloud by simplifying the user experience for researchers is our key mission,\" said Nathan Albrighton, CEO and founder of RONIN. \"The introduction of AWS Parallel Computing Service greatly simplifies our ability to build and operate HPC environments using APIs and elevates the HPC capabilities we offer to our customers.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a leading institution focused on research, innovation, and strategic partnerships to deliver solutions for a clean energy economy. \"The pursuit of scientific discovery comes with significant overhead associated with maintaining high performance computing infrastructure,\" said Michael Bartlett, cloud architect in the Advance Computing Operations Group at NREL. \"AWS Parallel Computing Service has the potential to improve our research efficiency by reducing this overhead with its automated update and observability management features. In particular, new capabilities for automatic scaling and handling high-throughput computing tasks will allow us to efficiently process large datasets and complex simulations, ensuring that our scientists can prioritize solving high-priority problems.\"\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first non-technology company in the U.S. to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate's stock has surged over 30% in 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This impressive feat comes just days before Buffett, often referred to as the 'Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha,' celebrates his 94th birthday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Berkshire's shares climbed to an all-time high, pushing the company's market value past the $1 trillion mark.\n\nUnlike the other members of the trillion-dollar club—Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta—Berkshire Hathaway is distinguished by its focus on traditional industries.\n\nThe company owns a diverse array of businesses. However, Berkshire's significant investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also been a significant contributor to its recent growth.\n\nBuffett took control of Berkshire in the 1960s and has since transformed it into a vast empire with interests in insurance, railroads, retail, and energy. The company is renowned for its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves.\n\nRecently, Buffett has adopted a more cautious approach, selling off a large amount of stock—including half of Berkshire's Apple holdings—and amassing a record $277 billion in cash by the end of June.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that over the past few days, Berkshire has sold more shares of Bank of America as the company continues to trim its stake in the U.S. lender.\n\nAccording to regulatory filings, Berkshire has sold around $5.4 billion worth of Bank of America shares sales since mid-July.

        "title": "Analyst: Companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) Now Getting ‘Little Bit of a Bang’ on Their AI Spending",
        "content": "We recently published a list of  Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang’s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it’s going to be a “difficult week” for major tech companies.\n\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\n“I still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,” Munster said.\n\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\n“There is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it’s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.”\n\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Among Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, recently reshuffled his portfolio after which Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of his three top picks. During a CNBC program, the analyst said that many are still questioning whether major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) will get any returns on their AI investments. He thinks, “if you look hard enough” you will see these tech companies have started to get a “little bit of a bang” on the bucks they are spending.\n\nFor Amazon, Mahaney likes “AWS growth acceleration.”\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "With EPS Growth And More, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Makes An Interesting Case",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Fast Is Amazon.com Growing?\n\nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Amazon.com managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Amazon.com shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 3.4% to 9.0%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Amazon.com?\n\nAre Amazon.com Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince Amazon.com has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$196b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.\n\nIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Amazon.com, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\n\nThe Amazon.com CEO received total compensation of just US$1.7m in the year to December 2023. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\n\nShould You Add Amazon.com To Your Watchlist?\n\nOne important encouraging feature of Amazon.com is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Amazon.com, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Amazon.com by focusing on just these factors, oryou could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the 3 Largest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies by 2035",
        "content": "A lot can happen in 11 years. Think back to 2013. That was the year that Frozen debuted in theaters, Barack Obama began his second term as president, and Twitter debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSo, looking ahead to 2035, which artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will be the three largest in the world? Here are my predictions. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nAlthough it is often the world's second-largest company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) should grow even larger over the next 11 years thanks to its numerous AI initiatives.\n\nTo start with, its cloud services segment, Microsoft Azure, should benefit immensely from the AI revolution. Azure, already the world's second-largest cloud services business, is well positioned to capture additional revenue as organizations ramp up their cloud and AI spending. The unit's machine learning tools and prebuilt AI models should attract even more revenue for its Intelligent Cloud segment, which already generates more than $100 billion in revenue annually.\n\nWhat's more, the next decade should see Microsoft integrate even more AI-powered features into its iconic software suite. Copilot AI integrations have already kicked off, and as AI tools continue to improve, the company should be able to extract even more revenue from its software suite and the AI add-ons that are incorporated into it.\n\nIn summary, Microsoft's diverse business segments should reap many benefits from the AI revolution over the next 11 years. That, in turn, will keep it firmly within the list of top 3 AI stocks by market cap.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Microsoft, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) operates one of the world's premier cloud services businesses, Amazon Web Services (AWS). And just like its foremost rival, AWS already generates more than $100 billion in annual revenue.\n\nYet, that figure will surely rise over the next 11 years due to the AI revolution. AWS offers a broad range of AI-powered services. Developers and organizations can use these tools to build, train, and deploy AI models.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon will use AI to power its other core business: e-commerce. The company already utilizes AI to power its massive logistics network. AI helps the company predict purchasing patterns, proactively stock its fulfillment centers, and determine the fastest and cheapest routes for shipping. On top of that, Amazon already uses close to 1 million robots within its facilities. That figure should skyrocket in the coming years, particularly as its robots become more effective and as labor costs continue to rise.\n\nWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon has some work to do to catch Apple, which currently has a market cap of $3.4 trillion. Yet, as noted above, 11 years is a long time, and I believe that Amazon can leapfrog the iPhone maker by 2035.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It should come as no surprise that the king of graphic processing units (GPUs) makes the cut.\n\nFirst of all, Nvidia's dominance of the GPU marketplace will be the main reason the company maintains its spot as one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its chips are sought after by developers for their speed and ease of use -- and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. In addition, AI developers are comfortable working with the company's CUDA parallel computing platform. That creates a barrier to entry for Nvidia's competitors, as developers may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with their offerings.\n\nHowever, Nvidia will excel over the long term for other reasons, too. Assuming autonomous driving capabilities improve and demand for them takes off, Nvidia could benefit. Furthermore, innovative gaming developments could bolster demand for its GPUs in the video game space, as could renewed interest in virtual reality simulations or the metaverse.\n\nAll in all, Nvidia remains a solid choice to be the top AI company for a reason -- its hardware is the go-to choice for developers working on the cutting edge of innovation. No one knows how the next 11 years will unfold, but it's easy to see that Nvidia is as well positioned for them as any company today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Unstoppable Hypergrowth Company Will Be the First $10 Trillion Stock (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "In the last 10 years, we've seen the markets hit some major numerical milestones from a market-capitalization perspective. Apple was the first trillion-dollar market-cap company back in 2018. The other \"Magnificent 7\" stocks -- so coined by Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett as Apple, Alphabet, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla -- soon followed. Now, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia all trade at market caps above $3 trillion. That is a lot of moola.\n\nThe next big milestone will be a market cap of $10 trillion. Let the race begin today between the technology giants. Even though it is starting well behind some of the other Magnificent 7 stocks, I predict Amazon will be the first company to hit a market cap of $10 trillion. Here's why.\n\nE-commerce has plenty of room to run\n\nAmazon and its sprawling e-commerce empire are well-known. Looking at its North America segment -- which also houses segments such as hardware and advertising -- revenue hit $370 billion over the last 12 months ending in June of this year. Even though it has been around for so long and has many detractors in the media and government, Amazon is set to surpass 40% market share of U.S. e-commerce sales this year.\n\nIf Amazon can just maintain market share in the category, there is a ton of room for North American revenue to grow over the next five to 10 years. E-commerce is only 16% of retail sales in the United States today. If that eventually doubles to 32%, Amazon's North American annual revenue will hit $740 billion.\n\nWith high-fixed costs across its e-commerce supply chain, more revenue will lead to profit-margin expansion. There will also be benefits from fast growing advertising services and third-party seller revenue, which are becoming a larger piece of the Amazon retail pie. Over the last 12 months, Amazon's operating margin in North America was 5.6% and keeps marching higher. In the next 10 years, I think this segment can surpass a 15% operating margin.\n\nA 15% operating margin on $740 billion in revenue is $111 billion in operating earnings just from the North American retail segment. Remember this number.\n\nCloud computing and AI\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon has perhaps an even more promising division in Amazon Web Services (AWS). The leader in cloud computing is close to passing $100 billion in annual revenue and posts impressive profit margins above 30%. It is riding a wave of growth in artificial intelligence (AI) at the moment but aims to be the computing bedrock for all sorts of modern software and other applications.\n\nLike e-commerce, the world is still in the early days of transitioning to cloud computing. On the latest conference call, executives reiterated that the \"vast majority\" of IT spending is still on-site. They believe it will eventually switch to cloud-computing solutions, which will benefit AWS.\n\nAWS revenue is growing at close to 20% year over year right now. If this slows to an average of 15% per year over the next 10 years, the division will eventually generate $400 billion in annual revenue, which isn't a crazy assumption given that global IT spending is in the trillions and growing as a sector year after year.\n\nAssuming operating margins stay at 30% or above, $400 billion in revenue equals $120 billion in operating income from AWS 10 years from now. AMZN Market Cap Chart\n\nAMZN Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nThe path to $10 trillion (and don't forget international growth)\n\nLong story short, I think Amazon is the most likely company to hit a $10 trillion market cap due to the huge runway for growth in the e-commerce and cloud-computing sectors. This is an unmatched tailwind across even other Magnificent 7 stocks, which look closer to market saturation.\n\nNow to the math that leads to a $10 trillion valuation. Add together $120 billion in earnings from AWS and $111 billion in earnings from North America, and Amazon will have a combined $231 billion in earnings 10 years from now. But don't forget the third pillar of Amazon's business: international retail. The segment generates $136 billion in revenue but has negligible profits due to exposure to emerging markets such as India.\n\nAs an earnings headwind today, markets such as India can be a huge growth driver if India's GDP per capita keeps growing at an impressive rate. A lot needs to go right in these other countries, but it is possible that the international segment can generate hundreds of billions in revenue and tens of billions in operating earnings 10 years from now if it can achieve similar profit margins as in North America.\n\nAdd it all together, and I think Amazon has a chance at generating $300 billion in earnings 10 years from now. At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 33 -- not unheard of for large technology stocks -- $300 billion in earnings equates to a $10 trillion market capitalization.\n\nI know that is a lot of math, but this is the path for Amazon hitting the next market-cap milestone and winning the race to become the largest company in the world. Regardless of how fast it gets there, the stock looks like a buy-and-hold investment at a market cap of $1.86 trillion today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

These companies were instrumental in driving the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains last year, with a Morgan Stanley report highlighting that these seven companies alone accounted for half of the index's total return.\n\nThe combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven exceeds that of the entire stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China, and Canada combined. However, this group has recently encountered significant setbacks. Six of the seven companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, and the results have fallen short of the lofty expectations set by investors.\n\nTesla, for instance, saw its earnings plummet by more than 40%, despite surpassing sales forecasts. Amazon’s share price plunged 11% following its earnings announcement. Growing concerns about the health of the US economy also fuelled a wave of selling across global markets.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\n\"Coming into this earnings season, the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were up against almost impossible expectations of beating perfection,\" Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBiz Investment Advisory Services, said. \"So in some ways, it's not surprising to see some sell-off here.\"\n\nThere are also cases where the Mag 7 are just too expensive. Nvidia's valuation surged to such heights that it became out of reach for many value investors. Back in July the company decided to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split, when it was trading at around $1,210, to make its stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. It is now trading at around $120 as the countdown continues to its earnings.\n\nThe $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks when it reports later on Wednesday, serving as a bellwether for AI spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.\n\nAs the AI rally enters a crucial stage, investors are left to consider where to look for alternatives to diversify their portfolio or undervalued stocks that might benefit from artificial intelligence. Here are some companies to have on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nFive alternatives to the Magnificent Seven ASML makes lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nThe AI rally has been driven by the need for the world’s most advanced chips. Dutch company ASML manufactures lithography machines essential for producing them.\n\nWhile not a household name, ASML should be on any investor’s radar who is looking to capitalise on the growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nASML is virtually the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. Its clients include semiconductor giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (005930.KS).\n\nWhen ASML published its quarterly results in July, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “ASML is further proof that the AI boom still has legs. Demand is soaring for the semiconductor equipment maker.”\n\nDespite a recent share price pullback, the current price of around $920 is more than 20% below analysts' consensus target of $1,194, and the vast majority of analysts still consider the stock a strong buy.\n\n“Companies across countless industries are investing heavily in AI, which means chipmakers have the confidence to build more manufacturing plants,” Coatsworth added. “That feeds into greater demand for ASML’s equipment, which plays a crucial role in the production of computer chips.”\n\nHowever, weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance has negatively impacted the stock. Nearly half of ASML’s sales still come from China, making geopolitical risk a significant concern for investors.\n\nRead more: How likely are multiple Bank of England interest rate cuts this year?\n\nASML is also part of the \"Granolas\" — a group of \"internationally-exposed quality growth compounders\" and Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven, according to Goldman Sachs. So named for the combined first initials, which spell Grannnllass, the eleven companies are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche (ROG.SW), ASML, Nestle (NESN.SW), Novartis (NOVN.SW), Novo Nordisk (NVO), L'Oreal (OR.PA), LVMH (MC.PA), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), SAP (SAP) and Sanofi (SNY).\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) The weight loss drug has proven to be a success with celebrities. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNovo Nordisk, another member of the Granolas, is currently Europe’s largest company by market capitalisation and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, is not exposed to the tech sector. This could be an attractive option for those who believe that AI is a bubble or simply want diversification.\n\nThe Danish firm makes the weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, which have gained widespread popularity, including among celebrities such as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and TV personality Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSam North, market analyst at eToro, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"Novo Nordisk emerges as a standout option in Europe. The Danish pharmaceutical giant has gone from strength to strength over the last few years and is currently the largest stock in Europe by market capitalisation.\n\n“Analysts are optimistic about Novo Nordisk's performance, particularly with its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. The company reportedly sold 10.4bn Danish kroner (£1.2bn) worth of Wegovy in the first quarter alone, more than doubling its sales from the same period last year.\"\n\nHe added: “From a technical analysis standpoint, there are a couple of levels that I think act as a good guide of sentiment for the bulls to focus on. The 740 DKK level offers a potential entry point for those looking to buy on dips, while a move above 928 DKK could signal a push towards its previous all-time high. In an environment where timing the market is challenging, Novo Nordisk stands out as a resilient and promising addition to any portfolio.”\n\nNovo Nordisk’s shares have surged around 260% since launching Wegovy in the United States in June 2021. The company’s market value of £455bn now exceeds the size of the entire Danish economy.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) The group that owns the Louis Vuitton brand has show resilience in the consumer discretionary segment.. (Pablo Cuadra via Getty Images)\n\nThough LVMH has lost its crown as Europe’s largest company to Novo Nordisk, it remains a heavyweight contender.\n\nDespite challenges in the consumer discretionary sector, LVMH has continued to deliver strong profits, with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels. This translated into €10.7bn (£9.02bn/$12bn) in operating profit. Additionally, its free cash flow increased by 74% to €3.13bn, or 7.5% of revenue.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on slowing growth and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22:2.\n\nLVMH's diversified conglomerate model, which includes brands like Tiffany, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora, allows it to tap into different luxury segments.\n\nGrowth is also likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall globally.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)  Snowflake chairman and CEO Frank Slootman gifts a snowboard to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nReturning to the US and the tech sector, Snowflake is well-positioned to benefit from the AI rally. Snowflake’s CEO Frank Slootman said: “There is no AI strategy without a data strategy.”\n\nThe company focuses on data management services, collecting and analysing an organisation’s data to deliver insights that help businesses grow. The rise of AI has made this data even more valuable.\n\nThe demand for Snowflake’s data management platform has driven strong revenue growth. In its 2024 fiscal year, Snowflake achieved $2.8bn in sales, up 36% from the prior year’s $2.1bn. The company expects its revenue to continue expanding, estimating $3.3bn in sales for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, analysts remain cautious, which could mean the share is currently undervalued.\n\n“Waning optimisation headwinds and emerging new product initiatives should support growth, but investors may need more concrete signals to get on board,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a report.\n\nSeven analysts have a \"strong buy\" recommendation for Snowflake’s shares, and 24 rate it as a \"buy\", according to Yahoo Finance data. The market consensus sees the share price trading at $166, higher than the current $118, with $220 as the high range for the stock.\n\nRolls Royce (RR.L) Rolls Royce has surprised investors under new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIt is not part of the Magnificent Seven, it does not list under Europe’s Granola’s and it is part of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which Nvidia alone has overtaken in value. So how can Rolls Royce be a Mag 7 alternative?\n\nThe company has delivered a total shareholder return of 221% over the past year, matching Nvidia's performance. This surprise achievement reflects growing investor confidence in the turnaround plan laid out by new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic.\n\nHis vision for Rolls-Royce is ambitious, aiming to transform the company into a leaner, more profitable enterprise with a bright future. Erginbilgic’s has set out to achieve a dramatic increase in adjusted operating profits from about £250m to between £2.5bn and £2.8bn by 2027.\n\nThis growth is underpinned by a strategy to unlock £2bn in working capital savings, primarily through better inventory management. These efficiencies are expected to help the company boost free cash flow from £500m to between £2.8bn and £3.1bn over the next five years.\n\nSince Erginbilgic joined, shares have more than quadrupled to top London’s premier index. That rally is made all the more remarkable given the struggles that gripped Rolls-Royce in the years prior, which included a very close brush with bankruptcy during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest turnaround is expected to happen at the civil aviation business, which accounts for nearly half of group sales. The rest of its revenues are split relative evenly between Rolls-Royce’s defence and power systems divisions.\n\nErginbilgic believes civil aviation’s adjusted operating margins can be lifted from 2.5% to between 14.5% and 16.5% by 2027. While the improvement looks dramatic, these levels of profitability are comparable to those of some rivals.\n\nThe current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Rolls-Royce stands at 18. While some investors may argue that this valuation isn't cheap, it's also not particularly expensive for a blue-chip company within the FTSE 100.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart said on Tuesday it would provide marketplace sellers its services to handle transportation of their goods from Asia directly to its U.S. warehouses, as well as fulfill orders and manage returns from any e-commerce website, in a new approach to bolstering its marketplace business ahead of the holiday season.\n\nWalmart's marketplace business has become an important revenue stream as it seeks to close the gap in handling third-party sales with Amazon.\n\nThe world's largest retailer's announcements follow the unwinding of its stake in Chinese e-commerce retailer JD.com last week. Walmart's efforts show that it is looking to handle more of its third-party business in-house.\n\nWalmart will also offer cash advances to qualified third-party sellers and waive peak-season storage fees for those who send their inventories to Walmart's fulfillment centers before Sept. 30.\n\nThese initiatives, announced during Walmart's annual Marketplace Seller Summit, are designed to assist sellers in meeting demand for holiday shopping and preparing for Walmart sales events. These events have historically coincided with Amazon's Prime Day in October.\n\nOver the past year, Walmart has aggressively added sellers to its Walmart.com marketplace, mainly from China. The retailer profits by encouraging these sellers, usually small businesses or independent stores, to use its Walmart delivery network or Walmart Fulfillment Services to fulfill orders and advertise their products on Walmart.com.\n\nSales via Walmart's marketplace have increased by over 30% in each of its past four quarters, the company said, contributing significantly to its global e-commerce sales, which exceeded $100 billion last year.\n\nWalmart has over 420 million products on its marketplace and more than 100,000 active sellers, over a third of whom are based in China, according to research firm, Marketplace Pulse. However, it still trails Amazon, which boasts more than 2 million active sellers.\n\nWalmart also announced that sellers could ship orders to customers via its fulfillment service at rates averaging 15% cheaper than competitors, though it did not provide details on the competitors. It also offered a service to handle the transportation of third-party sellers' goods from Asian ports of origin directly to its U.S. warehouses.\n\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Rod Nickel)",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Is ‘Worth Buying Into Weakness’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Have Jim Cramer’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks that have Jim Cramer's attention.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer notes that after a significant rally in the past two weeks, the market took a hit ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting in Jackson Hole. The Dow fell 170 points, the S&P dropped 43 points, and the NASDAQ tumbled 1.67%. This downturn marks a return to reality, which can be harsh.\n\n“After the monster move we’ve had in the last two weeks, that’s why, on the eve of the big Federal Reserve powwow in Jackson Hole, the averages got slammed. It’s back to reality, and reality can sting.”\n\nPreviously, after a dramatic unwind of the Yen carry trade, the market quickly collapsed but then rebounded strongly over eight days. According to Cramer, during that period, anything that was doing well surged, and there was optimism that anything struggling would improve once the Fed started cutting rates. However, that optimism has faded.\n\n“If you remember, after the sudden unwind of the Yen carry trade, the market experienced a sharp decline followed by a remarkable 8-day rebound. During that time, stocks that were performing well surged, and there was hope that struggling stocks would improve once the Fed began cutting rates. However, that was then, and this is now.”\n\nNow, we’re experiencing what Cramer refers to as the “buyer’s remorse” phase. Stocks that had risen on hope alone are now falling sharply. Even the prospect of the Fed stepping in hasn’t been enough to prevent the decline.\n\n“Since the winning streak ended, we’re entering what I call the “buyer’s remorse” phase. Stocks that had been climbing based on hope alone are now falling hard. Even the prospect of Fed intervention isn’t enough to prevent this decline. The selling might be exaggerated because the Fed is set to speak in Jackson Hole, and Wall Street has already factored in the possibility of a September rate cut—beyond that, it’s unlikely the Fed will announce multiple rate cuts, as some bulls hope.”\n\nCramer dismisses the first two explanations for the current market weakness: the idea that the Fed’s actions are too late or that the Fed can’t fix the economy. He believes the Fed’s interventions still have a significant impact, although companies with poor balance sheets might struggle.\n\n“There are also concerns that the Fed might be too late to make a difference, or that traders fear a potential Democratic sweep in November could lead to higher corporate tax rates—bad for earnings—and increased scrutiny on price gouging in supermarkets and drugstores.\n\nI don’t fully buy into the first two explanations. Not everything can be saved by the Fed, as some companies aren’t very sensitive to economic changes. Also, it’s never too late for a rate cut; delays might occur, but the turn is not canceled, except for companies with poor balance sheets. Those companies, burdened with debt, deserve to struggle if they can’t manage their obligations effectively.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third explanation, political concerns, seems more plausible to Cramer. He points out that investors initially saw President Biden as less favorable to the stock market due to his pro-labor stance. However, recent discussions suggest that a potential Harris presidency might be even more challenging for businesses. Harris is seen as critical of companies raising prices and could push for measures against price gouging, which might be difficult to achieve.\n\n“The third, politics-is-trickier. Before this week, many investors saw President Biden as unfavorable to the stock market due to his pro-labor stance. However, Vice President Harris, coming from California with ties to the tech industry and connections like her brother-in-law Tony West, General Counsel at Uber, was thought to be more business-friendly.\n\nRecent discussions suggest that a Harris presidency might be even tougher on businesses than Biden’s administration. There is a strong focus on criticizing food and drug companies for raising prices, even though the Biden administration attempted to control the prices of some heavily used drugs. Harris’s potential efforts to curb price gouging might face challenges, as large retailers like Walmart and Costco have already done a great job of pushing suppliers to reduce prices to pre-COVID levels.”\n\nCramer is also concerned about a recent prediction from market expert Larry Williams, which adds to his apprehension about the market’s future.\n\n“On the campaign trail, Harris might not recognize the distinction between good and bad actors, opting instead to broadly criticize big businesses for taking advantage of the pandemic. These factors might explain some of today’s market weakness, but what concerns me most is a recent prediction from market expert Larry Williams. I respect Larry’s insights and prefer not to contradict him.\n\nJim Cramer said Larry Williams predicted that the rally was “kaput.” This term, implying that the rally might be over, is especially worrying considering it was used after the eighth day of gains. Despite this winning streak, the market didn’t surpass its previous highs. Larry’s charts also indicated that the S&P 500 might face difficulties in the coming week, particularly due to Nvidia, which he considers a crucial stock in the market.\n\n“Larry sent us his thoughts on Monday, and he used a term that made me concerned. He said that the rally was “kaput.” Mind you, this was on the eighth day. The word “kaput” has some ominous connotations, right? Especially because we didn’t take out the highs of the averages despite the 8-day win streak. Worse, Larry’s charts showed tough sledding for the S&P 500 next week, led by the most important stock in the entire market—maybe the most important stock I’ve ever seen.”\n\nJim Cramer notes that with the market currently overbought—reflected in the S&P short-range oscillator reading of plus five—Larry’s view that the rally could be over seems plausible. Wall Street’s favorite GPU maker experienced a sharp drop recently, despite its strong performance leading up to the quarter. The stock’s sudden reversal was difficult to watch.\n\n“Given that the market’s overbought—plus five on the S&P short-range oscillator that I follow—the idea that the rally is kaput has some resonance. It doesn’t help that Nvidia ran up rapidly into the quarter and expectations have gotten out of hand. The stock did a horrible reversal today—just painful to watch.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyze a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks. We also review hedge fund opinions on these stocks and rank them based on hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nIn a recent Mad Money episode, Jim Cramer explained that after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s recent earnings report, which faced criticism due to weaker consumer sales and concerns about potential declines, the stock dropped to around $160. However, Cramer noted that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has since rebounded, suggesting that the initial negative forecasts were too pessimistic.\n\n“When Amazon reported three weeks ago, the quarter was criticized, with sellers focusing on weaker consumer sales and management’s comments on potential declines. Critics viewed concerns over spending impacts from the news cycle as an excuse. Despite this, the stock, which fell to around $160, has rebounded, reflecting that the negative forecasts were premature.\n\nAmazon is integral to my daily life, from receiving packages to using services like Instagram, Microsoft Outlook, and YouTube TV. Amazon’s ability to lower costs and improve efficiency is unmatched. The company continues to innovate and is not stationary. If Amazon dominates the essentials market, it could challenge local supermarkets and drugstores, given its scale and convenience. Additionally, Amazon Web Services remains a significant revenue driver and continues to strengthen.\n\nDespite some recent tough shopping days, Amazon’s stock is worth buying into weakness. Tech giants often rebound from downturns, and buying them during these periods can be advantageous. While not as spectacular as Prime Day deals, it remains a strong opportunity.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) achieved a 15% increase in revenue and a 33% rise in net income, reflecting successful business strategies and operational improvements. AWS plays a key role in Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s growth, with its revenue increase underscoring its leading position in cloud computing and potential for further expansion.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s advancements in e-commerce and logistics, such as automation and new delivery solutions, help it capture more of the online retail market and enhance customer experience. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s focus on sustainability and climate goals also boosts its reputation and operational efficiency.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of the stocks that have Jim Cramer's attention. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "How the Walmart-Amazon rivalry encapsulates the Fortune 500’s biggest trends",
        "content": "For the past five years, the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Fortune 500 have reflected a head-to-head retail rivalry. Walmart, which has ranked in first or second place on the list of America’s biggest companies by revenue every year of the 21st century and has been No. 1 for 12 years in a row, began competing with Amazon for the top spot beginning with the 2020 list, published that spring. (On the 2022 and 2024 Global 500 lists, Amazon was also No. 2.)\n\nThe 2020 edition of the Fortune 500 was published amid COVID pandemic lockdowns; however, its rankings reflected results from 2019—so, pre-pandemic financial performance. But from that point, Amazon’s ascent to runner-up status, which had long been in the works, seemed sure to be a fixture of the list for years to come, as consumer behavior during a stay-at-home era fueled online shopping out of both necessity and boredom.\n\nWalmart, of course, has its own robust e-commerce business, and consumers were ordering toilet paper and disinfectants, among other items, from wherever they could get their hands on them. But as past Fortune staffer and contributor Brian Dumaine wrote in the magazine in May 2020, pegged to the release of his book Bezonomics that same month, “If you were designing a company from scratch that could capitalize on a global crisis, it would probably look a lot like Amazon.” That fact goes beyond the company’s status as the “everything store”: Amazon Web Services cloud computing powers much of the world’s digital infrastructure (which proved to be increasingly lucrative upon COVID’s onset). And Prime, Amazon’s subscription business, continues to entice new signups with offerings spanning retail discounts and entertainment streaming. Prime boasts a reported three times the number of members of analog Walmart+.\n\nOne key foothold that Walmart has over Amazon is its stores. Amazon has acquired Whole Foods, launched brick-and-mortar brands such as Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, and partnered with many other retailers on grocery delivery and shipping. Still, given that approximately 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, Walmart has an advantage when it comes to the physical infrastructure that underpins selling goods online.\n\nThe Walmart-Amazon rivalry is a microcosm of many key economic dynamics that define the Fortune 500. There’s much to examine about these companies’ rise to become the highest-revenue-generating corporations in the world—and their competition with each other.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\n\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports indicate that the company has signed a deal to purchase Perceive Corporation from California-based technology firm Xperi. Perceive is the developer of Ergo, an AI processor that focuses on delivering edge inference solutions. The move is part of a wider plan by Amazon to invest in AI chips, like competitors Google and Apple. The deal is worth around $80 million and includes specific clauses that prevent Xperi and Perceive from engaging in certain business activities for three years after the purchase. Under the terms of the deal, employees from the newly purchased firm would join the ecommerce giant after the sale goes through.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) might be a bit behind other tech giants when it comes to incorporating AI into products, but Wall Street still considers it a top idea in the growth space. For example, investment advisory Seaport Research has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $200. In a recent investor note, the advisory underlined that while second quarter results and guidance were somewhat mixed for the company, the steady ecommerce growth, cloud leadership and advertising momentum were driving optimism around the shares.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Pfizer, joining Lilly, enters the direct-to-consumer market with a telehealth and prescription platform",
        "content": "On Tuesday, Pfizer (PFE) said it will enter the direct-to-consumer business, following the lead of a Big Pharma rival, Eli Lilly (LLY), which launched a similar plan in January.\n\nThe new website and patient platform, called PfizerForAll, aims to help patients more quickly access migraine treatments as well as vaccines and treatments for respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. While these are all products of Pfizer, the company contends that patients will not be forced to choose a Pfizer drug. That decision, they say, will remain in the hands of clinicians.\n\nPfizer chief US commercial officer Aamir Malik told Yahoo Finance the company is hoping to make access to medicines easier. \"Navigating our healthcare system is time-consuming. It's complicated. It's overwhelming. And the last thing that anybody needs when they're trying to get the care that they need for themselves or a loved one is to have to navigate that complex, painful, difficult system,\" Malik said.\n\nMalik and others point out that patients often have to search for doctors who can write the prescriptions they need quickly — or even find a doctor who will see them in a timely manner, Malik said.\n\nAdding to the complexity is the insurance process, which involves various coverage hurdles, such as pre-authorization requests and the hunt for a pharmacy that can dispense the drug at a lower co-pay cost.\n\nBut Pfizer's goal isn't to eradicate that complex system. Instead, Malik emphasized that the new portal will simply serve as an additional avenue for patients to get the drugs they are already familiar with, and also introduce new patients to the drugs. (It won't be able to help with drug shortages, as that issue rests with drug manufacturers.)\n\nIn addition, the site will have a customer helpline for patients if they run into any of the usual hurdles. That includes contacting the insurer to remove any access barriers or guiding the patients on how to contact the insurers themselves if needed.\n\nHow it works\n\nPfizer will use social media ads to find patients and funnel them to the new portal. The entry point will be whatever health problem the patient is trying to resolve, such as addressing migraine pain. That will lead to a specific landing page, which will offer a telehealth visit through a third-party vendor, UpScript, for $35 or an in-person visit with the booking portal ZocDoc.\n\nAt that point, the patient is outside of the Pfizer portal and has a visit with a clinician who can prescribe an appropriate drug. This could be a Pfizer drug — or not, Malik said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is no revenue sharing from the clinical visits or the prescriptions, which means that clinicians aren't getting paid or sharing in profits of the sales if they prescribe a Pfizer drug.\n\nPatients can then get the drug mailed or pick it up at their regular pharmacy. In the case of vaccines, Pfizer will help book appointments at major retail pharmacies CVS (CVS) or Walgreens (WBA), which have more than 17,000 locations combined across the country — and more pharmacies anticipated in the future. Under respiratory care, Pfizer will also offer access to at-home tests through Instacart (CART) the same day or via two-day shipping from Amazon (AMZN).\n\nPfizer said that the company doesn't see this as a profit-focused business. \"We're not building this as a standalone business with a revenue and a profit objective to it,\" Malik told Yahoo Finance. \"We're not holding revenue targets to PfizerForAll.\" Instead, the company will measure success on how popular the site is. A screenshot of PfizerForAll consumer platform for respiratory season. (Pfizer) (Screenshot of PfizerForAll consumer platform for respiratory season. Credit: Pfizer.)\n\nThe market\n\nEli Lilly launched its site, LillyDirect, earlier this year to help patients with diabetes, obesity, and migraines.\n\nLilly CEO David Ricks noted that the telehealth solution helps obesity patients the most — especially those hunting for its blockbuster drug, Zepbound. He told Yahoo Finance in January that \"patients report doctor shopping\" for someone who will write their prescription. That's why the site, in addition to offering telehealth, can also help find an obesity specialist by zip code.\n\nLillyDirect is similar to PfizerForAll in that it relies on replicating the traditional pathway to get a prescription. But the clinicians are different. Whereas Pfizer is using one platform for telehealth and ZocDoc for doctor's visits, Lilly is using three different telehealth platforms.\n\nFor diabetes and obesity, Lilly is using 9amHealth, which accepts a limited number of insurance plans only in Texas and California. It is unclear if patients in other states have access. Lilly is also using FormHealth for obesity, which accepts most major insurers and Medicare. For migraine treatments, the company partnered with Cove, which accepts insurers and has a $30 copay or costs $99 for a visit without insurance.\n\nCompare that to the $35 flat fee through Pfizer for UpScript.\n\nIn the eight months since its launch, it is unclear how well LillyDirect is doing. Lilly declined to provide Yahoo Finance with updates on traffic to the site.\n\nIn a first quarter earnings call in April, Lilly USA Diabetes and Obesity president Patrik Jonsson said that the site was \"gaining traction by weeks.\" But in response to a question about tracking prescriptions for GLP-1 weight loss drug Zepbound, Jonsson said, \"It's relatively low volume that goes through LillyDirect.\"\n\nBut new patients, who are filling prescriptions for the drug for the first time in their lives through the site, was slightly higher, he said. No specific numbers were provided.\n\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIt still makes a lot of sense to own momentum stock darling Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n“If you don’t own Nvidia, you are literally missing out on a revolution,” Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (watch video above; listen in here).\n\nGerber opined those not investing in Nvidia are comparable to people “not investing in Napoleon during the French Revolution.”\n\nGerber says his firm has owned Nvidia's stock for over a decade.\n\nInitially, Nvidia’s strong position in gaming chips was the draw. But as Nvidia has pivoted to autonomous car chips and powerful AI chips, Gerber has been gobbling up more shares of the Jensen Huang-led tech play.\n\n“It’s been the best investment we’ve ever made,” Gerber added.\n\nThe firm’s longtime bullishness appears to have paid off handsomely. Recently, shares have skyrocketed with plenty of upside.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged more than 2,900% in the past five years, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabs the leadership position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong results continued in its first fiscal quarter, with sales rising 18% year over year to $26 billion. Non-GAAP earnings boomed 461% from the prior year.\n\nWhen Nvidia reports its closely watched second quarter results on Wednesday afternoon, the Street is looking for more of the same. Revenue and earnings are expected to rise 113% and 156%, respectively.\n\nGerber isn’t alone in his optimism on Nvidia.\n\nIn a June visit to the Opening Bid podcast, EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson told Sozzi he believed the company could hit a $6 trillion market cap, nearly double its then-$3.25 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia's current market cap stands at about $3.18 trillion.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia ahead of earnings.\n\nConcerns such as delays in next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture are potential short-term woes, said Hari in a note to clients.\n\n\"Overall, we expect management commentary coupled with supply chain data points over the coming weeks to lead to higher conviction as it pertains to Nvidia’s earnings power in calendar 2025,” wrote Hari in a note.\n\nHari noted that significant customers, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), have unveiled plans to increase capital spending, and Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are allocating capital expenditure growth toward AI and cloud products.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Intra-quarter data points continued to indicate a robust demand environment,” wrote Hari.\n\nThis past week, Nvidia's rival AMD (AMD) announced the $4.9 billion acquisition of server equipment maker ZT Systems. To Nvidia bulls, the deal underscored how much the company is outpacing a worthy competitor such as AMD, led by Lisa Su.\n\n“We’re long-term investors,” Gerber said. “I think Nvidia should be a core holding, with Microsoft, for sure.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apollo Global Management Inc. and BlackRock Inc. are in talks to provide new debt financing for the merger of two Amazon aggregators, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\nThe proposed deal continues an ongoing consolidation of such companies, which raised billions of dollars and snapped up brands sold on Amazon.com Inc., only to watch the pandemic-era e-commerce boom fizzle.\n\nIn the latest merger, Paris-based Branded is in talks to acquire San Francisco-based Heyday in exchange for $521 million in equity in a new company to be named Essor, which means “take flight” in French, the people said. The new company would be worth more than $1 billion, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\n\nThe deal would include an undetermined round of new debt from BlackRock, Apollo and Apollo-backed Victory Park Capital to help Essor make acquisitions in the distressed direct-to-consumer e-commerce market, the people said.\n\nBlackRock declined to comment, while Apollo declined to immediately comment.\n\nBranded and Heyday were among dozens of aggregators with audacious plans to become Digital Age consumer conglomerates. Many are now saddled with debt, and Thrasio, which raised the most of any aggregator, filed for bankruptcy protection in February.\n\nBranded Chief Executive Officer Pierre Poignant will run the new company, the people said. He previously co-founded the Southeast Asia-focused online marketplace Lazada, in which Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has a controlling stake. Branded raised $140 million from investors including Berlin venture firm Target Global and sells such products as the Puracy line of plant-based cleaners.\n\nHeyday founder Sebastian Rymarz will become president of the new company, which is expected to generate annual revenue of $400 million, the people said. Heyday raised more than $250 million from such investors as Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst, as well as debt from Victory Park Capital. Heyday’s brands include the acne treatment Zitsticka, now sold in Target, and the flouride-free toothpaste brand Boka.\n\nThe newly formed company will use a new round of debt to buy promising online brands and try to boost their sales and exposure by getting them into big-box retailers, the people said. More than 80% of consumer spending occurs in physical stores, according to EMarketer Inc., making shelf placement a promising strategy to boost sales of brands that began online.\n\nStory continues\n\nApollo in 2021 pledged as much as $500 million to Victory Park Capital, which has bet on multiple aggregators. BlackRock also made loans to Amazon aggregators, some of which the firm recently moved to non-accrual status, as borrowers began failing to make payments.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) ‘Has A Strong Long-Term Potential’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks.\n\nJim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold.\n\n\"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal—buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\"\n\nJim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday’s market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally.\n\n\"We were due for today's modest pullback—the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven't seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today’s session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what—stocks actually went down. That didn’t happen much during the 8-day gain.\"\n\nJim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias.\n\n\"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We've reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we're back to business as usual—where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can't just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There's a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\"\n\nCramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren't met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe's recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there's no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly.\n\n\"It doesn’t help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don’t go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it's a summer Friday.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) the Number One EV Stock Across the Globe?\n\nA state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall.\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nNumber of Hegde Fund Investors: 37\n\nWhen a viewer asked Jim Cramer about Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), he explained that the company has solid long-term potential due to its significant backing, which reduces the risk of running out of money in the short term. Cramer noted that, while Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) will face challenges in scaling up its operations, he is not focusing on short-term fluctuations.\n\n\"I think Rivian has a strong long-term potential because they have significant backing and therefore are unlikely to run out of money in the short term. However, it will be a rocky road as they have many challenges to overcome to ramp up their operations. I'm not going to focus on short-term movements, but for someone like you, Henry, who has a long-term horizon, this might be a good investment opportunity.\"\n\nRivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is poised for significant growth, driven by its successful expansion of production facilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has increased its production capacity at its Normal, Illinois plant and is building a new facility in Georgia, which will add the ability to produce 250,000 vehicles annually by 2025. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s strong order backlog, including a notable 100,000 electric delivery vans from\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMZN), highlights substantial revenue potential and client confidence. Consumer demand is also robust, with over 90,000 pre-orders for the R1T and R1S models showing a positive market response.\n\nStrategic investments from Ford Motor Company\n\n(NYSE:F) and T. Rowe Price\n\n(NASDAQ:TROW), along with partnerships such as with Meridian Audio for premium sound systems, bring valuable capital and industry expertise. Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s ongoing research and development, including its advanced quad-motor system and the introduction of more affordable EV models, strengthens its competitive edge. Additionally, Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)'s commitment to sustainability through carbon-neutral manufacturing and the use of sustainable materials meets growing consumer and regulatory expectations.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a US-based manufacturer of electric vehicles, namely the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. They also have exposure to the commercial vehicle market with their electric delivery vans (EDVs) that are sold to companies like Amazon. The company has faced challenges amid the broader slowdown in electric vehicle demand and rising interest rates. This has contributed to Rivian underperforming expectations over the past few quarters. Rivian has also incurred losses as it continues to invest in the development of its products and manufacturing capabilities. We own Rivian in a hedged structure, which provides a significant margin of safety. Despite the near[1]term challenges, several factors provide optimism that Rivian can emerge as a long-term winner in the EV market. Rivian’s balance sheet is strong, with a substantial cash position that enables the company to continue investing in its growth and navigate through the current economic headwinds. Rivian is also unveiling the R2, which is a smaller and more affordable EV platform that will open the company’s products to a wider customer base. Lastly, Rivian’s investment in the enhancement of its production capabilities should improve the company’s manufacturing efficiency and drive a path to profitability. We continue to hold the company in a hedged structure.”\n\nOverall RIVN ranks 9th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer wants you to check out. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Kroger-Albertsons Deal Heads to Court With Food Price Focus",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Kroger Co. and Albertsons Cos. are finally getting their day in court.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\nNearly two years after the acquisition was announced, the grocery giants on Monday started a federal court hearing in Portland, Oregon, on the US Federal Trade Commission’s bid to block the $24.6 billion deal. The FTC alleges the tie-up would lead to higher grocery prices for consumers and lower wages for the supermarkets’ unionized workforces.\n\nMore than 100,000 Americans wrote to the antitrust and consumer protection agency to express concerns about the proposed takeover, FTC lawyer Susan Musser told US District Judge Adrienne Nelson, who is overseeing the case.\n\nThe combination of Kroger and Albertsons will lead to “less choices for customers and more power for the merging firm,” she said.\n\nThe grocers say they need to combine to compete against bigger rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., in what would be the biggest ever US grocery deal if it comes to fruition. They have pledged to spend $1 billion to cut prices if the deal goes through, another $1 billion on improving worker pay and benefits and $1.3 billion on store conditions. Meanwhile, the companies have already spent more than $850 million to pay lawyers, investment bankers and other advisers.\n\nIn thousands of markets across the country, Musser said, Kroger and Albertsons are each others’ closest rival. For example, in Corvallis, Oregon, the companies operate four out of six stores in the area, she said. Both grocers price-check and compare product selection against other supermarkets, she said, most often looking to the other company.\n\nUnder US merger law, the acquisition would be automatically illegal in 1,922 local markets, Musser said. Even when including organic grocery stores, club stores like Costco Wholesale Corp. and limited selection outlets such as Aldi Inc., the tie-up would still lead to high concentration and harm thousands of areas across the country, Musser said.\n\nInternally, Albertsons executives were aware of the potential competition issues, with one writing to his colleagues that the deal is “basically creating a monopoly in grocery,” Musser said.\n\nThe grocery transaction is latest FTC case to head to trial under the Biden administration, which has stepped up antitrust enforcement, particularly on the merger front. The results in court have been mixed with some high-profile losses, such as the challenge to Microsoft Corp.’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc. That was followed by wins in the agency’s suit against Illumina Inc. over its purchase of the startup Grail and block of IQVIA Holdings Inc.’s deal to buy rival Propel Media Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nJennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who focuses on antitrust, said the FTC’s odds of winning are good leading into the trial.\n\n“We lean toward the FTC for now, given the sensitivity of the industry, a history of failed divestiture remedies in the grocery sector and weaknesses in the companies’ offered remedy,” she said.\n\nPolitical Spotlight\n\nThe acquisition has come under a political spotlight during a period of historic inflation. Grocery inflation hit a four-decade high in 2022, driven by higher costs of labor, transportation and ingredients. Everything from beef and flour has become more expensive, though price increases have moderated in recent months. Retailers have said this year that prices of packaged foods remain high, with some manufacturers still weighing more increases.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has called for a federal ban on food and grocery price gouging, part of proposals intended to reduce consumer costs. In a fact sheet on her economic proposals, Harris’ campaign specifically called for greater antitrust enforcement on food mergers, citing the FTC lawsuit against Kroger and Albertsons.\n\nEight states, plus Washington DC, have joined the FTC in the case, which is one of several legal proceedings aimed at blocking the deal. Colorado and Washington state have filed separate suits in state court, with trials scheduled to begin in September after the federal hearing ends. A complaint is also pending in the FTC’s in-house court, though on Aug. 19, Kroger filed a suit in federal court seeking to block that trial on constitutional grounds.\n\nKroger CEO Rodney McMullen and Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran are both expected to testify during the proceeding, which is expected to last three weeks. The executives already defended the deal nearly two years ago before a Senate subcommittee, arguing that the combined company would be the number-four grocery retailer behind Walmart, Amazon and Costco.\n\nProposed Divestments\n\nIn a bid to resolve the antitrust concerns, the companies have agreed to sell a group of nearly 600 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc.\n\nThat proposed divestiture is unlikely to work, as the company has never operated more than 100 stores at a time, Laura Hall, another FTC attorney told the judge. In 2021, C&S bought 12 stores as part of a deal between Tops Friendly Markets and Price Chopper Inc. and the company has struggled to operate those, Hall said.\n\nC&S, which primarily operates as a wholesaler, is mostly interested in the distribution centers it will acquire from Kroger and Albertsons, and plans to recoup its investment without the retail supermarkets. Internally, the company estimates that it will take 11 years for the stores to be profitable, Hall said.\n\nThe proposed divestiture also doesn’t remedy all the proposed harm, she said. In Corvallis, the companies said they would divest one of the four stores, but the combined Kroger-Albertsons would still control 50% of the market.\n\nAt a news conference Monday ahead of the trial start, unions representing more than 100,000 workers at Kroger and Albertsons stores called into question the companies’ promises to reduce consumer prices after the merger.\n\n“Why wait if grocery prices are already inflated?” said Kim Cordova, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 7 in Colorado. “They’ve made massive profits during the pandemic, so what does a billion dollars mean to them?”\n\nJessica Crowley, a pharmacist at a Pavilions in Los Angeles, said the merger would also reduce patient access to medication, noting that C&S doesn’t have any experience operating pharmacies.\n\n“History shows us we can’t trust merger promises,” she said.\n\nThe proposed deal has also sparked debates about the definition of a grocery store as the food-retail industry undergoes massive changes and competition intensifies.\n\nAmazon jumped into the grocery sector with its purchase of Whole Foods Market and launch of Amazon Fresh. European retailers like Aldi and Lidl have expanded their footprint in the US, pitching their no-frills operations with low prices. Dollar stores have been selling more groceries, too, while regional operators ranging from Publix Super Markets to Wegmans Food Markets Inc. are adding stores. Walmart remains the nation’s biggest food seller and is attracting shoppers with its focus on value.\n\nThe grocery business has become much more complicated. Retail giants have diversified their operations, selling everything from advertising to prepared foods. They are also investing in technologies to fulfill online orders more efficiently.\n\nJoining forces with Albertsons would help Kroger become a bigger national player. If the purchase goes through, the combined entity would operate more than 4,000 stores across 48 states and DC. The combined entity would also become more efficient with managing inventory, stores and distribution centers, according to industry analysts.\n\n“They can’t price as effectively as those bigger stores like Walmart,” Noah Rohr, a Morningstar analyst, said of Kroger. “Closing the merger would help.”\n\nBoldest Deal\n\nBoth supermarkets have a lot at stake. The acquisition is Kroger’s boldest deal in history and one that would define the legacy of its CEO McMullen, who started as a part-time bagger at the grocer in the late 1970s. If the deal falls apart, Kroger will likely turn its focus on improving and investing in its existing stores.\n\nAlbertsons could emerge again as a deal target if the deal doesn’t go through. In the near term, the grocer will need to focus on operations, technology and other areas it lags its rivals to compete more effectively. Sankaran, who was previously at PepsiCo Inc., joined Albertsons in 2019 to help take the company public the following year.\n\n--With assistance from Max Zimmerman.\n\n(Updates with FTC arguments beginning in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): The Best Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nAn Analysis of the Technology Industry\n\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\n\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.\n\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:\n\n“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”\n\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\n\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started as an online bookstore. Today it has grown to become a $1.85 trillion company and is recognized as one of the largest online retailers, has operations in cloud computing, and digital streaming, and is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nAMZN is the best technology stock to buy for the long term, we say this because it was held by 308 hedge funds in Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $65.85 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $8.46 billion.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a significant increase in revenue and operating income during its latest quarter. Its top line reached $148 billion after increasing 11% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven by a strong performance in its AWS division, which grew 18.8% to reach $26.3 billion.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) enjoys the benefit of repeat spending from its subscription-based services, thereby providing it with significant operating income. During Q2 2024, its operating income soared 91% year-over-year to reach 14.7 billion, out of which $9.3 billion came from its AWS operations.\n\nThe stock did take a hit with the market indexes falling in 2022, however, since then it has continued to improve and the stock hit all-time highs this year. Management’s effort to significantly improve inventory management has resulted in the company making record-free cash flow. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) free cash flow was up 572% year-over-year and was recorded to be more than $52.9 billion during the quarter. This strong cash generation can be profitable for both the company as it can invest in its AI development and for investors as they will get increased returns.\n\nOver the past decade, the company has grown its revenue and net income by 22% and 73% indicating robust financials and long term growth opportunities from its recurring revenues.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Harris, Trump and the Future of Corporate Taxes",
        "content": "Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will clash over corporate tax rates in the next two months.\n\nAs president, Trump pushed for lower corporate tax rates and got them. In 2017, Congress slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\n\nCorporate tax as we know it today was born in 1909. The rate has been as low as 1% in 1910 and as high as 52.80% in 1968. According to the IRS, the average rate from 1909 to 2024 has been 32.08%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nIn 2022 under President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which mandated that large corporations pay at least a 15% rate regardless of how many deductions and credits they have.\n\nTrump says he will try to lower corporate taxes further. Harris proposes raising them to 28%.\n\nYet, judging by the campaign contributions I've looked at, corporate executives appear to be leaning more toward Harris than Trump.\n\nHere's a look at four prominent corporations' tax rates, their political contributions in the 2023-24 election cycle and my opinion of their stock.\n\nI chose these four companies because they were featured in a Fortune magazine article in 2022 about companies that paid next to nothing -- or nothing at all in Taxes in 2021. Since then, their taxes have gone up, at least in part because of the Biden minimum.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) paid less than 19% in corporate taxes in four of the past five years. It paid a bundle (54% of pretax profits) in 2022, however.\n\nIndividuals associated with Amazon have given $438,360 to the Harris campaign, according to the website Open Secrets, which tracks political contributions and lobbying expenditures. They have given only $102,292 to the Trump campaign.\n\nContributions by Amazon.com as a corporation to political action committees have been fairly small and about evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAmazon stock is expensive, selling for 42 times recent earnings and nearly 8 times book value (corporate net worth). I'm a cheapskate and wouldn't buy it, but most analysts would. Of 60 analysts covering the stock, 59 rate it buy or outperform.\n\nDare I go against so much expert opinion? You bet. A study I do each January tracks the fate of the stocks most loved by analysts and the stocks most despised by them. Universal love for a stock is not a good sign. The adored stocks have performed worse than the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index.\n\nExxon\n\nAt Exxon Mobil Inc. (NYSE:XOM), the tax rate has been running at around 29% lately.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets, entities affiliated with Exxon Mobil have given about $155,000 this year to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, and $32,500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndividuals associated with Exxon Mobil have given $37,678 to Trump and $22,849 to Harris, the website says.\n\nThe stock, selling at 14 times earnings and a little less than two times book value, seems attractive to me. I think the transition to solar and wind energy will be a long one and fossil fuels will continue to be important at least into the 2030s.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T's tax rate lately has been about 21%, and it has not been higher than that since 2015.\n\nTabulations by Open Secrets show that AT&T has given more money to PACs supporting Democrats (about $350,000) than Republicans (about $225,000). Individuals associated with AT&T have given $119,341 to the Harris campaign and $68,371 to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe stock? It pays a sweet dividend, with a yield of 5.6%. But it hasn't been a great investment, as it's lost 25% over the past five years. The company's debt load is larger than I prefer.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), the tax rate recently has been about 18%, and hasn't been above 19% since 2018.\n\nIndividuals associated with Microsoft have given $1.10 million to the Democratic National Committee Services Corp. and the company has given $15,000 to it. Individuals at the company have given $120,215 to the Republican National Committee.\n\nIndividuals associated with Microsoft have given $580,872 to Harris, versus $81,706 for Trump.\n\nMicrosoft is a profit powerhouse. Its operating profit margin is close to 45%. Return on stockholders' equity is very high, about 37%.\n\nArguably, that makes the stock worth its current valuation of 35 times earnings and more than 11 times book value. It is not my cup of tea to pay up for quality, but I understand why many people do so.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston, Massachusetts.

        "content": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s famous advice to \"be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful\" is a very interesting approach to buying good companies at good prices. Finding a good company that has a good price and is going through a good time with clear prospects is often quite difficult, but for long-term investors who have the stomach for the good old buy and hold, buying good companies at good prices but that are going through a delicate time or with slightly cloudy prospects is often enough.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) fits the bill. After posting mixed second-quarter earnings, which disappointed the market with a miss in revenue and worse-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, the shares retreated sharply before recovering.\n\nThis, together with the tech sell-off and fears of a recession, means Amazon is at one of the best valuation levels in recent years, even though it is worth around $1.86 trillion.\n\nAmazon is cheap enough to own\n\nLooking at the multiples, Amazon is cheaper than it was years ago, even though it has improved substantially in terms of revenue, market share, options and cash generation. After the dip, the forward price-earnings ratio reached its historic low of 36, while the price-to-operating cash flow ratio reached 16.50, close to the levels seen in the 2008 recession and other more troubled periods, which means this multiple is also close to its low of 13.30 and far from its mean of 27.50 over the last 20 years. Note these multiples are reaching their lowest level even though free cash flow over the last 12 months has reached its highest level. Amazon: Still Attractive After Earnings\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nFor the stock to be trading so far from its averages and for a bargain of 16 times its operating cash flow, you might think the prospects have changed, but no. In fact, according to the estimates, expectations for Amazon remain excellent. Over the next three years, the revenue growth rate is estimated at 10.80%, earnings per share at 35.20% and operating cash flow per share at 30%.\n\nIt may seem disproportionately cheap for a stock that is expected to grow its cash from operations by 30% and is still trading at only 16 times, but there are some reasons that inflate this indicator and should be clarified. One of the reasons is capital expenditures, though cash generated by operating activities was $108 billion over the last 12 months, the capital expenditure was almost $60 billion, putting pressure on the generation of shareholder value in the short term. As I highlighted previously, in the short term this capex is likely to remain high to support the growth of Amazon Web Services, automation and other initiatives. In the words of management, the second half of 2024 is set to be higher to \"support the growing need for AWS infrastructure.\" At some point, as these initiatives mature, this capex should decline and, consequently, free cash flow will expand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother reason for operating cash flow being higher than net income is stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense that dilutes the shareholder over time and depending on the volume can be detrimental in the long term. Cash generation for the shareholder is expected to increase much faster than the amount by which the shareholder is diluted by the stock-based compensation, to the extent that value generation for the shareholder is greater and compensates for this negative factor. Not only that, but at some point in the next few years when operating cash flow increases and capex decreases, the buyback and other forms of shareholder remuneration may increase and surpass the stock-based compensation. But even with this positive outlook, there is no guarantee this will happen, so it may continue to be a relevant pressure for value generation in the medium term and benefit these price-to-cash flow indicators and should be monitored.\n\nSomething interesting to note is the longer history is not so positive, with stock-based compensation increasing significantly along with operating cash flow. However, in the most recent period, there has been a certain stability in this type of compensation, while cash flow continues to grow substantially. Amazon: Still Attractive After Earnings\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nAll this implies that Amazon shares are trading at an attractive level compared to their own history and considering future prospects. It is hard to say that a stock trading at more than 35 times earnings is a bargain, but we must balance this by considering not only the size of its moats, but also the amount the company can generate and the pace at which it will be able to increase this cash flow. Amazon, therefore, has a fair valuation and is not an expensive company for what it offers.\n\nA brief second-quarter earnings overview\n\nIt is not possible to justify this discount on stocks with second-quarter earnings, since although they were not entirely positive, they were not that bad either. Revenue was $147.98 billion, while estimates were for $148.78 billion, but the consensus on AWS revenue was surprising.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings per share came in at $1.26 while Wall Street was expecting something close to $1.02.\n\nFor the next quarter, Amazon expects revenue between $154 billion and $158.50 billion and operating income in the range of $11.50 billion and $15 billion, disappointing the market which expected higher volumes. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky justified these assumptions with some factors, such as pressure on margins in the third quarter due to Prime Day deals and marketing spend on account of the event and consumer attention on other events around the world.\n\nOn the positive side, the operating margin reached 10%, up 4 percentage points year over year, driven mainly by better margins at AWS and International, which were up 11 percentage pointes and 4 points respectively. Despite the cloudy expectations for AWS's margins in the medium term, it is interesting to note the company's initiatives to reduce cost-to-serve, improve inventory and other profitability initiatives are maturing and are already showing results, especially for the International segment, which until recently was unprofitable and now, with the start of operating leverage and these strategies, already has a margin of 0.90%.\n\nAmazon can survive bad times\n\nAnother factor driving the brief decline in Amazon's stock was the fear of a recession, brought on by triggers such as weaker employment data and an interest rate increase in Japan.\n\nAt first glance, a recession is bad for Amazon's operations and should have some impact on its fundamentals. In recessions, it is common for there to be lower consumer spending, which directly affects sales growth, as well as possible margin pressures due to price, lower cost dilution and other potential challenges.\n\nThis is obvious since a large part of Amazon's operations come from retail, which is a segment that is very affected by the economic environment, with a lot of competition. With worse data on inflation, unemployment, citizens' disposable income and more, expectations for people buying from Amazon or even being willing to sign up for subscriptions or spend on ads are reduced, especially for non-essential products. If there is this macroeconomic pressure on the consumer, not only will they think twice before buying products such as household and kitchen appliances, but if that product is cheaper at a competitor, the customer will possibly give up the quality of the service in favor of a cheaper price, which can lead to a price war and a reduction in margins.\n\nBut in second-level thinking, a recession could benefit Amazon in the medium term. The e-commerce giant is known not only for its very good service, with its fast delivery and ease of shopping, but also for its very competitive prices. This is made possible by its incredible gains in scale due to its colossal size. If there is one player in the retail sector that is able to survive the recession, it is Amazon, which means that, in this scenario, there is less competition as smaller companies become less competitive and this ends up translating into a gain in market share for the large, established players. Further, although some non-essentials are affected in this environment, some of Amazon's products can be considered essential, showing little fluctuation even in more complex scenarios.\n\nAnd that's if a challenging macroeconomic environment that lasts does materialize since as the American economy is quite resilient, there is a possibility that the signals in parts are just noise or other positive factors compensate.\n\nIn any case, I believe the best stance to adopt is something balanced, buying a good company at good prices is good, so adding exposure to Amazon after it dips seems interesting to me since it still has its moat and great growth prospects.\n\nAt the same time, it is not plausible to get rid of all your cash or allocate a large sum just because of a short-term dip. The current share price can serve as an opportunity, but it's not a huge dip.\n\nIn short, Amazon is not exactly recession-proof, but it has enough of a moat and financial strength to survive bad times and eventually return to growth. The company has a financial strength score of 8 out of 10, with more than $70 billion of cash on hand (although a significant amount of long-term debt) and consistent and growing operating cash generation. Amazon: Still Attractive After Earnings\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nThe long term is still bright\n\nThe most recent quarter came with some positive news, such as improved margins and a continuation of growth, but it also brought some uncertainty for the next quarter, with a more cautious outlook on growth and some margin hurdles. This was further catalyzed by fears of recession and a sell-off in big tech.\n\nEven so, if we consider a longer investment horizon, Amazon is likely to remain a solid company that can increase shareholder value generation. Its capex of $50 billion reinforces that the company still has a lot to capture in terms of revenue growth and efficiency improvements.\n\nThe company's internal strategies, coupled with its leadership in the cloud, retail, logistics and other sectors, make it a resilient company even in the most challenging scenarios. Perhaps at first Amazon will be affected by a more complex landscape, but again, for investors who have the cash to take advantage of the dips and a long investment horizon, it should benefit and be able to capture this generation of value.\n\nAll in all, at current prices Amazon can be considered a company that offers a good risk-return ratio and encompasses both a reasonable valuation and excellent prospects.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Since no one knows what will happen at any given time in the stock market, investors are always looking for tips, guidance, and direction. What better place to find it than the portfolios of billionaire asset managers? It's a strategy that makes sense as long as you, of course, do your own due diligence as well. After all, your strategy and allocation will likely look different than Warren Buffett's.\n\nTwo stocks that are popular now among some asset managers and could provide inspiration for your own next great buy are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Here's why.\n\n1. Amazon: A no-brainer growth buy\n\nBuffett owns Amazon, and so do many other billionaire asset managers, such as Larry Fink of BlackRock and Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management. It fits so many different investing styles, which is why it's such a universal investment. It offers growth, but it's not very risky. It has loads of opportunities, but it's backed up by its incredible brand and assets.\n\nE-commerce is still a standout. Amazon accounts for more than a third of all e-commerce in the U.S., and its business increased 9% in the U.S. in the second quarter, with 10% growth internationally. CEO Andy Jassy noted that while there's strong loyalty from Prime members, shoppers are still trading down to cheaper products because of inflation, which impacts total sales growth. When that lifts, these numbers, which are impressive as is, could accelerate.\n\nThe big excitement now is over generative artificial intelligence (AI), and Amazon has an edge as the leader in cloud computing services, with more than 30% of the market. Clients of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) are looking for flexibility, and Amazon offers a wide array of services targeting businesses that have in-house developers as well as smaller clients that need easy-to-use solutions.\n\nAmazon emphasizes that only a small percentage of information technology (IT) spending is currently on the cloud, but there's going to be a big flip, and that's starting to happen. Amazon is poised to benefit, saying that the generative AI business already has a \"multibillion-dollar revenue run rate.\"\n\nThere's also advertising, streaming, and more, and on top of all that, Amazon stock is trading at close to its lowest valuation in years at the current price. That makes it a growth buy that will also work for value investors.\n\n2. PayPal: A no-brainer value buy\n\nPayPal Holdings has been a huge disappointment for investors over the past few years. It squandered its lead in digital payments, allowing new service providers to steal market share, and its stock has plunged 74% over the past three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it recently got a new CEO, and there's been a lot of progress. PayPal comes along with an incredible brand, important relationships with millions of merchants and customers, and massive opportunities. That's why it looks more like a bargain than a value trap and appeals to billionaires.\n\nRevenue increased 9% in the second quarter on a currency neutral basis, beating guidance of 7%. Meanwhile, its operating margin expanded 1.3 percentage points to 16.8%. Profitability and cash flow have been a problem for PayPal recently, and it demonstrated strength on both accounts in the second quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) up 17% year over year and adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion.\n\nNew CEO Alex Chriss has been doing what needs to be done; sharpening the company's focus and focusing on innovation. Some of the billionaire hedge fund managers who have PayPal stock in their portfolios include Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors, John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments, and Israel Englander of Millenium Management.\n\nAt the current price, PayPal stock trades at 17 times trailing-12-month earnings, which looks like a bargain considering its brand and opportunities. If you already took a chance on PayPal when it was even lower, like some of the billionaires who own it, you would have already seen your investment appreciate -- it's up 21% since the second-quarter earnings release. But it's not too late to buy; PayPal looks like a no-brainer value buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia,  Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nNVIDIA: The Path to $10 Trillion\n\nSemiconductor and AI leader Nvidia reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company’s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\n\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week’s earnings report and whether it’s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\n\nHow Did Nvidia Stock Get Here?\n\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia’s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\n\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia’s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock’s unprecedented rally.\n\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It’s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\n\nNvidia Earnings Estimates\n\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out, the expectations are equally impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn’t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven’t been upgraded recently.\n\nCan Nvidia Reach $10 trillion?\n\nIt isn’t just possible, it’s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\n\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\n\nShould Investors Buy Shares in Nvidia?\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company’s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\n\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company’s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): The Best Among The American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other American stocks.\n\nWith August Ending, What Can We Expect From US Markets?\n\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\n\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\n\nHow Would a Potential Rate Cut Impact The Markets?\n\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\n\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another big tech company requiring no introduction. The main reason why this stock is so popular among customers is because it offers exceptional diversification in AI and cloud computing to its customers, making its products and services among the most popular choices for cloud users.\n\nIn the company's second-quarter 2024 earnings call, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy, noted that the company's AI business has been growing dramatically, and this trend is expected to continue because of one core belief held by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This belief is that there is no one AI tool that can rule the world. Developers and consumers working with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are thus offered diverse options in AI tools, which ensures that they get the best tool for the job when they partner with this company.\n\nAnother reason for the company's stellar growth and rising popularity among investors is the profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Demand for AWS has been on the rise, particularly because of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) investments in generative AI projects. This is what resulted in AWS revenues growing to 18.8% year-over-year in the second quarter.\n\nIn total, 308 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $65.8 billion.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is atop the throne as the largest company in the world. It leads second-place Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by $280 billion, but I don't think it will maintain its leadership position.\n\nIn the next five years, I think multiple companies will overtake Apple, but two picks are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). These two have a strong case for becoming larger than Apple, but it won't happen overnight.\n\nWhy am I bearish on Apple?\n\nFirst off, let's talk about Apple. In my opinion, Apple is trading so high due to its past performance. If you look at the performance without the name attached, Apple isn't currently that great of an investment. If I approached you with a stock that posted shrinking revenue for five of the last seven quarters, and in the two quarters it delivered growth, the best growth rate was 5%, you'd probably pass. Throw in the fact that this company is trading at 34 times forward earnings, and you'd run for the hills.\n\nBut, because Apple is Apple, investors give it a pass. This won't go on forever, and eventually, something will give. This opens up a lane for Alphabet and Amazon to surpass it, as they still have multiple growth catalysts ahead of them.\n\nCloud computing is a huge part of Amazon's and Alphabet's investment thesis\n\nWhile many think of Amazon as just an e-commerce channel, it's much more than that. Commerce businesses have notoriously low margins, so Amazon has multiple other divisions that help boost its profits. One of the fastest growing is its advertising services, which has been on fire over the past few years.\n\nAnother strong segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing offering. AWS is the largest cloud computing business by market share but has recently delivered slightly less growth than its competition. However, AWS' growth has reaccelerated, which is a huge selling point for the stock.\n\nAlthough AWS makes up 18% of Amazon's revenue, it accounted for 64% of its operating profit in the second quarter. Though Amazon's business is much broader than cloud computing, its cloud services are a massive part of the Amazon investment thesis. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion in 2029, it has a huge demand wave pushing it.\n\nAn investment in Alphabet is also an investment in its advertising business. With ad revenue making up around three-fourths of total revenue, it's a huge part of its business. Many are worried its search engine dominance may come to an end with competitors like OpenAI entering the arena. However, I think these concerns are overblown, as it would require billions of people to change their habits very quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don't see that happening anytime soon, so I'm not concerned about some of the increased competition.\n\nAnother bonus for Alphabet is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. While Google Cloud isn't as big as AWS, it's still a big part of the growth story, as cloud computing is in huge demand thanks to the AI arms race.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet have their primary businesses, but their cloud computing wings are huge reasons to consider buying the stocks. Apple doesn't have the same kind of growth catalysts pushing it, so don't be surprised if either of these two passes up Apple within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs), which specialize in owning and managing warehouses, fulfillment centers and distribution hubs, are positioned to be the top beneficiaries of this trend – especially those that have e-commerce powerhouses like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as their tenants.\n\nIn addition to their growth potential, REITs typically offer high dividend yields. Like all REITs, industrial REITs must distribute a significant portion of their income to shareholders as dividends.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nDon’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\n\nLet's look at three industrial REITs that name Amazon as one of their top tenants.\n\nStag Industrial\n\nAs of June 30, Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) owns and manages a portfolio of 573 industrial buildings across 41 states, containing over 114 million square feet. Amazon is Stag's largest tenant, with six leases that equate to approximately 2.8% of its annualized base rent. Other notable tenants include Coca-Cola, FedEx, Tempur Sealy and DHL.\n\nStag currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.123333 per share, which equates to an annualized dividend of $1.48 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 3.75%.\n\nIn addition to offering monthly income and a high yield, Stag offers dividend growth. It has raised its annual dividend payment every year since its initial public offering in 2011, resulting in 12 consecutive years of increases. Its 0.7% hike in January puts it on pace for 2024 to mark the 13th consecutive year with an increase.\n\nPrologis\n\nAs of June 30, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) owned ownership interests in more than 5,500 industrial properties worldwide, containing approximately 1.2 billion square feet, making it the largest REIT in the world. Amazon is Prologis' largest tenant, with about 45.7 million square feet leased, representing 5.1% of its net effective rent. Other notable tenants include Home Depot, FedEx, DHL and UPS.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrologis currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share, which equates to an annualized dividend of $3.84 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 3.1%.\n\nLike Stag, Prologis has consistently grown its dividend. It has raised its annual dividend payment each of the last 10 years and its 10% hike in February puts it on track for 2024 to mark the 11th consecutive year with an increase.\n\nRead More:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. You don’t have to own a property to make money from fix-and-flip investments. Get started with only $10.\n\nEastGroup Properties, Inc.\n\nAs of June 30, EastGroup Properties (NYSE:EGP) owned and managed more than 500 industrial properties containing approximately 60.2 million square feet. With four leases, Amazon is EastGroup's largest tenant, representing approximately 1.8% of its annualized base rent. Other notable tenants include Starship Logistics, Trane and FedEx.\n\nEastGroup currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which equates to an annualized rate of $5.08 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 2.8%.\n\nWhile EastGroup may have the lowest yield of the stocks discussed in this article, it has the most impressive track record of dividend payments. It has paid dividends for 31 consecutive years with 28 increases and no reductions, including increases in the last 12 years.\n\nBetter Yields Than Some REITs?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through REITs.\n\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. It paid 8.1% in July. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nAs long-term rates go down and short-term rates stay high, there’s a unique chance to invest in fix & flip loans before yields drop. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article Collect Rent From Jeff Bezos' Amazon With These 3 Stocks originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.\n\nBut the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test this week with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.\n\nA done deal\n\nOn Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.\n\nBut he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.\n\nPowell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.\n\nWith only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.\n\n\"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 38.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen the day prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nCapital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.\n\n\"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\"\n\nWhile Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomists expect annual \"core\" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.\n\nPowell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\"\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.\n\nAs has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.\n\nThe stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.\n\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.\"We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.\"\n\nVinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.\n\n\"Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,\" Vinh said.\n\nCharles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment office Omar Aguilar said the release will be a \"very anticipated\" release for the broader market too.\n\n\"What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,\" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday.

Amazon and Apple were exceptions.\n\nSnider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"\n\nHe added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\n\n\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.\n\nNow, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.\n\nNothing like price to change an investor's feelings.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)\n\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)\n\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)\n\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

        "title": "AI's insatiable energy demand is going nuclear",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is ubiquitous in today’s world, not just for being one of the biggest and most established online marketplaces but also for being among the largest data center providers.\n\nWhat Amazon is far less known for is being the owner and operator of nuclear power plants.\n\nYet that’s exactly what its cloud subsidiary, AWS, did in March, purchasing a $650 million nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the surface, the deal indicates Amazon’s ambitious expansion plans. But dig deeper, and the company’s purchase of a nuclear power facility speaks to a broader issue that Amazon and other tech giants are grappling with: the insatiable demand for energy from artificial intelligence. An aerial view of an Amazon Web Services data center situated near single-family homes on July 17, 2024, in Stone Ridge, Virginia. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images) (Nathan Howard via Getty Images)\n\nIn Amazon's case, AWS purchased Talen Energy’s Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center to co-locate its rapidly expanding AI data center next to a power source, keeping up with the energy demands that artificial intelligence has created.\n\nThe strategy is a symptom of an energy reckoning that has been building as AI has been creeping into consumers' daily lives — powering everything from internet searches to smart devices and cars.\n\nCompanies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) continue to enhance AI capabilities with new products and services. Each AI task requires vast computational power, which translates into substantial electricity consumption through energy-hungry data centers.\n\nEstimates suggest that by 2027, global AI-related electricity consumption could rise by 64%, reaching up to 134 terawatt hours annually — or the equivalent of the electricity usage of countries like the Netherlands or Sweden.\n\nThis raises a critical question: How are Big Tech companies addressing the energy demands that their future AI innovations will require? A car drives past the nuclear plant on Three Mile Island in Middletown, Pa., on March 26, 2019. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)\n\nThe rising energy consumption of AI\n\nAccording to Pew Research, more than half of Americans interact with AI at least once a day.\n\nProminent researcher and data scientist Sasha Luccioni, who serves as the AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a company that builds tools for AI applications, often discusses AI's energy consumption.\n\nLuccioni explained that while training AI models is energy-intensive — training the GPT-3 model, for example, used about 1,300 megawatt-hours of electricity — it typically only happens once. However, the inference phase, where models generate responses, can require even more energy due to the sheer volume of queries.\n\nFor example, when a user asks AI models like ChatGPT a question, it involves sending a request to a data center, where powerful processors generate a response. This process, though quick, uses approximately 10 times more energy than a typical Google search.\n\nStory continues Rep. Jennifer Wexton uses an AI program on her iPad at her home in Leesburg, Va., on Friday, July 19, 2024. (AP Photo/John McDonnell) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The models get used so many times, and it really adds up quickly,\" Luccioni said. She noted that depending on the size of the model, 50 million to 200 million queries can consume as much energy as training the model itself.\n\n\"ChatGPT gets 10 million users a day,\" Luccioni said. \"So within 20 days, you have reached that 'ginormous' ... amount of energy used for training via deploying the model.\"\n\nThe largest consumers of this energy are Big Tech companies, known as hyperscalers, that have the capacity to scale AI efforts rapidly with their cloud services. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Meta (META), and Amazon alone are projected to spend $189 billion on AI in 2024.\n\nAs AI-driven energy consumption grows, it puts additional strain on the already overburdened energy grids. Goldman Sachs projects that by 2030, global data center power demand will grow by 160% and could account for 8% of total electricity demand in the US, up from 3% in 2022.\n\nThis strain is compounded by aging infrastructure and the push toward the electrification of cars and manufacturing in the US. According to the Department of Energy, 70% of US transmission lines are nearing the end of their typical 50- to 80-year life cycle, increasing the risk of outages and cyberattacks. Large electrical transmission lines run through grasslands to power the newly completed Meta's Facebook data center in Eagle Mountain, Utah on July 18, 2024. (GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images) (GEORGE FREY via Getty Images)\n\nMoreover, renewable energy sources are struggling to keep pace.\n\nLuccioni pointed out that grid operators are extending the use of coal-powered plants to meet the rising energy needs, even as renewable energy generation expands.\n\nAI upends Big Tech sustainability pledges\n\nMicrosoft and Google have acknowledged in their sustainability reports that AI has hindered their ability to meet climate targets. For instance, Microsoft’s carbon emissions have increased by 29% since 2020 due to AI-related data center construction.\n\nStill, renewable energy remains a crucial part of Big Tech’s strategies, even if it cannot meet all of AI's energy demands.\n\nIn May 2024, Microsoft signed the largest corporate power purchasing agreement on record with property and asset management giant Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 gigawatts of new renewable power capacity globally through wind, solar, and other carbon-free energy generation technologies. Additionally, the company has invested heavily in carbon removal efforts to offset an industry-record 8.2 million tons of emissions.\n\nAmazon has also made significant investments in renewable energy, positioning itself as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the fourth consecutive year. The company's portfolio now includes enough wind and solar power to supply 7.2 million US homes annually.\n\nHowever, as Yahoo Finance reporter Ines Ferre noted (video above), “The issue with renewables is that at certain times of the day, you have to also go into energy storage because you may not be using that energy at that time of the day.” Google's first data center in Germany is pictured during its inauguration in Hanau near Frankfurt, Germany, on Oct. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBeyond sourcing cleaner energy, Big Tech is also investing in efficiency. Luccioni said companies like Google are now developing AI-specific chips, such as the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), that are optimized for AI tasks instead of using graphical processing units (GPUs), which were created for gaming technology.\n\nNvidia claims that its latest Blackwell GPUs can reduce AI model energy use and costs by up to 25 times compared to earlier versions.\n\nFor a glimpse of what lies ahead for tech firms that don’t manage energy costs, look no further than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). TSMC makes more than 90% of the world’s most advanced AI chips and has seen energy costs double over the past year, reducing the company’s margins by nearly a full percentage point, according to CFO Wendell Huang.\n\nIn order to more accurately gauge energy demands and reduce future costs, experts say transparency is key.\n\n\"We need more regulation, especially around transparency,\" said Luccioni, who is working on an AI energy star-rating project that aims to help developers and users choose more energy-efficient models by benchmarking their energy consumption.\n\nWhen it comes to tech companies' priorities, always follow the money, or in this case, the investments. Utility companies and tech giants are expected to spend $1 trillion on AI in the coming years.\n\nBut according to Luccioni, AI might not just be the problem — it could also be part of the solution for addressing this energy crunch.\n\n\"AI can definitely be part of the solution,\" Luccioni said. \"Knowing, for example, when a ... hydroelectric dam might need fixing, [and the] same thing with the aging infrastructure, like cables, fixing leaks. A lot of energy actually gets lost during transmission and during storage. So AI can be used to either predict or fix [it] in real-time.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 AI terms Nvidia investors should know",
        "content": "Despite some volatility in the stock market so far in August, Nvidia stock (NVDA) remains up over 150% this year.\n\nDriving the stock is Nvidia's role in supplying chips to major tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) that are crucial for artificial intelligence technology amid the broader generative AI boom.\n\nOver a third of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) market cap gains in the first half of 2024 could be attributed to Nvidia. For some investors, the concentration of gains in a few stocks such as Nvidia seems risky. It was a point that was underlined earlier this month by a stock rout that briefly pushed the volatility index (^VIX) above 60 and shares of Nvidia down by as much as 10%.\n\nStocks ended up recovering, but the period offered a reminder to investors that they could seek AI opportunities elsewhere.\n\nFor those looking to gain an edge and diversify their tech holdings, understanding AI's core technology and terminology is essential.\n\nHere's a breakdown of a few of the terms you need to know to invest in the AI boom:\n\nInference\n\nInference is AI’s moment of truth. It's when an AI model like ChatGPT generates an answer to a prompt based on its previous training and learning. The quality of an AI system's inference relies heavily on its underlying technology stack, including the powerful chips that drive it. President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCompute\n\nCompute power is the driving force behind an AI system's success, similar to how horsepower propels a car. The greater the compute power, the more efficient and faster the inference process becomes.\n\nProcessing power, memory, and storage all fuel compute power, and chipmakers tend to focus on increased compute power for new chip releases because improvements in compute power with each chip generation could allow companies to charge more, which typically bodes well for future profit margins.\n\nGPUs\n\nGraphics processing units, or GPUs, are advanced and expensive chips that power AI. Their quality can help determine the speed of AI computations. Nvidia, which began working on GPUs in the '90s, owns over 80% of the GPU market and mentioned the term 19 times in its first quarter earnings presentation. Nvidia’s GPUs have increased AI inference performance by a thousand times over the last decade.\n\nHyperscalers\n\nBig Tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon are considered hyperscalers, or those capable of rapidly scaling AI. With products and services such as Microsoft's Copilot, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta's Llama, these companies are significant both as consumers of AI chips and competitors to chipmakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Growth Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Microsoft in 5 Years",
        "content": "Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is a king of reliability, known for its consistent financial and stock growth. Over the last five years, the company's share price has risen 200%, while free cash flow has climbed 92%.\n\nMicrosoft's steady growth has secured it a market cap above $3 trillion, allowing it to remain in the world's top three most valuable companies. In fact, from about February to June of this year, Microsoft temporarily surpassed Apple and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in market cap, taking the top spot.\n\nMarket fluctuations have seen the world's top five most valuable companies reshuffle multiple times in 2024. Even throughout August, Nvidia and Microsoft have been duking it out for second place on an almost weekly basis. Meanwhile, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) appears to be on a bull run that could surpass the Windows company in the coming years.\n\nNvidia and Amazon have been on exciting growth paths thanks to skyrocketing earnings. These companies dominate their respective industries and are profiting from consistent investment in the lucrative artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nWhile Microsoft is known for consistency, Nvidia and Amazon are expanding at a rate that could allow them to overtake the company. So, here are two growth stocks I predict will be worth more than Microsoft in five years.\n\n1. Nvidia: A meteoric rise that is unlikely to slow any time soon\n\nNvidia's business has delivered record growth since the start of 2023, with its stock up 779%. Its meteoric rise has seen it steadily climb through the ranks of the world's most valuable companies, as seen in the chart below. AAPL Market Cap Chart\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia's market cap is above Microsoft's. Their positions switched multiple times this month, suggesting could swap again by the time you read this. However, Nvidia is included in this list as I'd argue that it will have surpassed Microsoft for good and gained a solid lead within the next five years.\n\nNvidia massively outperformed Microsoft in 2024, with its stock up 159% compared to Microsoft's 10% rise. Meanwhile, Nvidia's quarterly revenue is up 18% year to date, with Microsoft's up 4%. At this rate, Nvidia could even secure its spot ahead of Microsoft much sooner than five years.\n\nNvidia's stellar gains are primarily thanks to its dominance in AI. The company is responsible for between 70% and 95% of all AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training AI models. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working to catch up, launching rival GPUs this year. However, Nvidia's head start and $39 billion in free cash flow (compared to AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $13 billion) suggests it won't have too much trouble maintaining its lead.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn AI, Microsoft has a prominent role in cloud computing. However, fellow cloud giants Amazon and Alphabet are much closer competitors than Nvidia's rivals in the GPU market.\n\nNvidia will report its second quarter of fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug. 28. After over a year of beating quarterly earnings, the company will likely continue recent trends and deliver another quarter of impressive growth. Its stock could soar, furthering its lead on Microsoft.\n\n2. Amazon: Soaring earnings and the cash to surpass its rivals\n\nAmazon and Microsoft are in steep competition in the cloud industry. As of Q2 2024, Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud market share stood at 31%, while Microsoft Azure's was at 25%. However, Amazon ramped up its cloud investment over the last year, which could allow it to hold onto its lead in the industry and eventually push its market cap above Microsoft's. MSFT Chart\n\nAmazon consistently outperformed Microsoft over the last year. Solid growth in retail and AWS has seen Amazon's profits soar, allowing it to sink billions into its AI efforts.\n\nIn March, Bloomberg reported that Amazon plans to spend nearly $150 billion on data centers over the next 15 years to expand AWS' reach. The company anticipates an explosion of demand for AI applications and other digital services, requiring a more extensive cloud network. The news aligns with multiple reports in recent months that announced Amazon's data center investment in U.S. locations including Ohio, Indiana, and Virginia, as well as international spots such as Singapore, Spain, Saudi Arabia, India, and Taiwan.\n\nThe expansion will increase Amazon's cloud and AI capabilities. Meanwhile, a vast network will allow it to boost other areas of its business with the generative technology, such as e-commerce, grocery, digital advertising, and more.\n\nAmazon's market cap currently sits at $1.8 trillion. However, its earnings and stock are expanding at a rate that will likely see it overtake Microsoft in the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Once-in-a-Decade Investment Opportunity: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "During a CNBC interview, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called artificial intelligence (AI) the fourth industrial revolution. He drew parallels between the burgeoning AI market, the creation of the internet in 1995, and the launch of the iPhone in 2007. Ives expects an \"AI spending tidal wave\" to supercharge the technology sector in the coming years.\n\nSimilarly, billionaire fund manager Dan Loeb told clients that AI \"has matured to the point that it is driving a transformational technology platform shift similar to those seen roughly once per decade: the personal computer in the 1980s, the internet in 1990s, mobile in the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s.\"\n\nIn short, AI is a once-in-a-decade investment opportunity. That doesn't mean the so-called AI bubble -- a phenomenon whereby numerous AI stocks have gained substantial value over a short period -- will never burst. There will undoubtedly be setbacks and drawdowns along the way. But smart investors will ignore temporary hurdles because they know interest in AI is here to stay.\n\nHere's why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Docebo(NASDAQ: DCBO) could help investors capitalize on this once-in-a-decade opportunity.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter, with its top line growing a little more slowly than analysts anticipated. Specifically, revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, but Wall Street expected $148.6 billion. However, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income surged 94% to $1.26 per diluted share, easily exceeding the consensus estimate of $1.03 per diluted share.\n\nUnfortunately, Wall Street was also disappointed with the guidance. Management said operating income would increase between 3% and 34% in the third quarter, but analysts anticipated 37% growth. However, the shortfall is due to investments in AI infrastructure and fulfillment capacity for the holidays, as well as digital content costs associated with NFL Thursday Night Football, all of which are worthwhile expenses.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon should continue to benefit as e-commerce spending increases, but its largest opportunities lie in digital advertising and cloud computing. Amazon is the third-largest digital advertiser worldwide, and the company is gaining share so quickly that it could overtake second-place Meta Platforms by the end of the decade, according to eMarketer.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) runs the largest public cloud in the world, and it widened its lead by a percentage point over Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform in the second quarter. AI is one reason AWS is gaining market share. New products like generative AI development platform Amazon Bedrock and coding assistant Amazon Q are gaining customer traction.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts, \"Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days.\" AWS is perfectly positioned to meet the demand for AI cloud services because it operates the largest public cloud and spends heavily on product development, from custom AI chips to software.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow earnings per share at 25% annually through 2025. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 42 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.7, a material discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this stock today.\n\n2. Docebo\n\nDocebo specializes in corporate learning software. Its learning management system lets businesses create, curate, deliver, and measure the impact of training across internal and external use cases. To elaborate, businesses can use the platform to train employees and partners and to embed customer-facing education into their products.\n\nDocebo has differentiated itself with two innovative applications. Docebo Flow lets users integrate learning content into other applications, enabling employees to learn during the normal flow of work. Docebo Shape uses generative AI to turn source materials, like online articles, corporate documents, and case studies, into learning content.\n\nIn a note to clients, Morgan Stanley analysts Josh Baer and Keith Weiss wrote, \"Docebo is not only disrupting the internal learning management system (LMS) market, taking share from legacy vendors, but it is also leading the market in a greenfield external learning opportunity.\"\n\nDocebo reported solid financial results in the second quarter that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Its customer count climbed 9%, and the average contract value rose 10%. In turn, revenue increased 22% to $53 million, and adjusted net income surged 86% to $0.26 per diluted share. Interim CEO Alessio Artuffo told analysts, \"Our leadership in the learning industry, along with the effective use of AI, continue to set us apart from legacy competitors.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Grand View Research estimates that LMS spending will compound at 19% annually through 2030. Docebo should match that pace, with potential upside arising from its generative AI application. Wall Street expects Docebo's adjusted earnings to increase by 58% annually through 2025. That makes its current valuation of 83 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Dumped Apple. 3 Stocks He Should Buy Instead.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge sale on its massive Apple position in the second quarter -- a position that was reported as $174 billion at the end of 2023 shrank down to $85 billion after Berkshire sold roughly half its Apple shares last quarter.\n\nWhether Buffett is selling out completely or simply reducing the size of the stake remains to be seen. The important thing is that the greatest investor of all time now has a lot more cash to reinvest in something more attractive.\n\nThree Fool.com contributors weighed in with their suggestions on stocks Buffett might want to consider. Here's why they believe Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton(OTC: LVMHF), and Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM) would fit in with Berkshire's previous stock holdings and businesses it already owns.\n\nBuffett should double down on Berkshire's Amazon stake\n\nJohn Ballard (Amazon): Amazon would make an excellent candidate to park some of Berkshire's billions for a couple of important reasons.\n\nFormer Berkshire vice chairman Charle Munger, who died last year, previously called Amazon a \"phenomenon of nature.\" He admired the talents of founder and executive chair Jeff Bezos to build Amazon's brand amid intense competition in the retail industry. Munger also believed over five years ago that Amazon may have a long runway of growth ahead.\n\nBuffett's preferred investment has always been a business with a durable competitive advantage, and of course, Berkshire owns several retail businesses, including Nebraska Furniture Mart, See's Candies, and Pampered Chef, that have been successful in a cutthroat industry. Amazon certainly has a wide economic moat to protect itself from the pressure of competitors. It enjoys tremendous customer loyalty and has one of the strongest brands around.\n\nMost importantly, Amazon has a significant infrastructure advantage in e-commerce. It has mapped the entire U.S., with large fulfillment centers that stock an unbeatable selection of items at competitive prices. In 2023, this allowed the company to deliver over 7 billion items within one day to millions of customers.\n\nAmazon also has a technological lead over its retail competitors. It has invested in artificial intelligence (AI) for years, which powers the product recommendations on its website. It's also paving the way for strong growth in its industry-leading cloud enterprise business Amazon Web Services, a $98 billion revenue-generating business that is growing at double-digit rates.\n\nFinally, Berkshire already owns 10 million shares of Amazon stock. One of Buffett's investing deputies purchased a small stake on behalf of Berkshire in 2019. It wouldn't be a stretch to see Buffett add to that stake at some point.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is a more profitable business than the average discount retailer. It generated $48 billion in free cash flow on $604 billion of revenue over the last year. With the company's profitability continuing to grow, the stock can deliver satisfactory returns for patient investors like Warren Buffett.\n\nA perfect fit for Buffett\n\nJeremy Bowman (LVMH): Buffett has long been a fan of big-brand consumer stocks. Coca-Cola, for example, is Berkshire's longest-held stock, and Apple is still his biggest holding, despite having dumped roughly half of its stake this year.\n\nHowever, Buffett has typically avoided luxury stocks like LVMH, even though they have many of the same assets as companies like Apple and Coca-Cola, including a set of well-known brands that command a higher price point, a track record of success, and a smart management team.\n\nBuffett is even friends with Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH, and Buffett sent him a letter asking him to reconsider his planned retirement at age 80.\n\nAs for the stock, LVMH is fresh off a clever partnership at the Olympics where it sponsored everything from medal trays to wines and spirits under its Moet Hennessy brands.\n\nBuffett can also appreciate LVMH's massive conglomerate model, which is the largest in the luxury sector, containing brands such as Tiffany, Sephora, Tag Heuer, and Dom Perignon.\n\nIn a challenging time for consumer discretionary goods, including luxury, LVMH has continued to post strong profits with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels, translating into 10.7 billion euros ($12 billion) in operating profit.\n\nThe stock has also pulled back on that slowing growth, down 21% from its 52-week peak and trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.6.\n\nGrowth is likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall around the world, and the stock would fit well in Berkshire's portfolio and bring a new category to the company. It's a good buy for Buffett and any other long-term investors looking to own a proven winner.\n\nI'm surprised Buffett hasn't bought this stock until now\n\nJennifer Saibil (Williams-Sonoma): Investors love to dissect Warren Buffett's stock picks, but Berkshire Hathaway also wholly owns plenty of whole businesses, including large companies with names you know like Duracell batteries, Dairy Queen restaurants, Geico insurance, and Brooks sports equipment.\n\nWhat you might not know is that Berkshire Hathaway owns several furniture businesses, making it one of the largest furniture companies in the country. Berkshire's furniture-related investments are also lesser known. The conglomerate took a stake in high-end furniture retailer RH in 2019 but has since sold it.\n\nUpscale furniture company Williams-Sonoma might do well as a Berkshire investment because it operates much like your typical Buffett stock, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it end up in his portfolio.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma is a leading housewares company with a resilient consumer base. Although it's feeling the pressure of inflation, it runs a tight ship and still manages to generate strong margins and profits. Adjusted gross margin (which admittedly included a tax benefit this quarter) was 45.4% in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended April 30), a 6.8% increase year over year. Operating margin came in at 19.2%, up from 16.6% last year.\n\nThose are excellent margins under any circumstances for a retailer, and even more so when sales are down and inflation is high. Management raised its full-year outlook for operating margin, and it reiterated long-term guidance of revenue increases in the mid-to-high single digits and operating margin in the mid-to-high teens. That's efficient use of capital, which is something else that Buffett looks for in a business. It also generates consistently strong free cash flow and has no debt.\n\nOn top of that, Williams-Sonoma pays a growing dividend with a slightly above-average yield of 1.4%, and it returns value to shareholders through an ample share repurchase program.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma stock trades at a reasonable valuation and its forecasted future earnings suggest it could be undervalued. It's not as cheap as it was last year, but at 17 times trailing-12-month earnings, it's still much cheaper than the S&P 500 average of 27.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings 'absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade'",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) is back. But it’s about to be put to the test again.\n\nThe next big event for the market is the chip darling’s earnings report, set for after the bell Wednesday.\n\nAnd it’s not just Nvidia stock that’s on the line: Nvidia’s results will set the pace for other AI players.\n\n“Nvidia’s report and guidance will be absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade,” tech investor Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe past several weeks have been a roller-coaster ride for tech investors. Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%.\n\nAnd second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period.\n\nBut strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\n“Nvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,” Ives told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIves, who expects a “shock and awe” quarter from Nvidia, says continued strong demand for the company’s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta, Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant’s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech’s next move.\n\n“Nvidia is a bellwether of the Magnificent Seven and AI trade,” Shmulik explained. “If there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.”\n\nSo far this year, Nvidia’s stock has soared. Shares are up 180% over the past year and up nearly 2,900% over the past five years — setting the bar very high for earnings this quarter.\n\nEstimates are for Nvidia's revenue to grow 112% in its latest quarter, marking a dramatic slowdown from over 250% growth one year ago. For Wall Street, consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it’s safe to say the stakes are high.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
        "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.1% over the past month. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n\n19% = US$44b ÷ US$236b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Amazon.com's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 21%. This probably goes some way in explaining Amazon.com's moderate 14% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.\n\nWe then performed a comparison between Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AMZN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Amazon.com Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "When Warren Buffett speaks, investors listen. And when Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)files its 13F form -- which goes through the holding company's latest trades -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), investors start analyzing.\n\nThe most recent 13F had two new positions and some smaller trades. But most of the equity portfolio, which has 41 stocks right now, remained the same. Buffett is a big believer in long-term investing, and his favorite holding period is, famously, \"forever.\"\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) are two no-brainer stocks to buy right now, and I'm going to add a new position, Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA), to that list, too.\n\n1. Amazon: the artificial intelligence (AI) stock\n\nAmazon is one of the few tech stocks that Buffett owns. In fact, he only bought in 2019, after it had already minted millionaires. Buffett doesn't go for glitz or hype; he prefers stability and value. That's an approach that's helped him beat the market over his decades at the helm of his holding company even as he avoids fast growing stocks.\n\nAmazon has become the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, and it's reliable for cash and profitability. That's why even though it's a tech stock that embraces new trends, it still fits into Buffett's schema. It's one of few AI stocks that you'll find in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\n\nOf course, Amazon is a lot more than AI. It has an unparalleled global e-commerce business which accounts for almost 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. That's a moat that's impenetrable to any real challengers in the near term. It isn't taking any chances, though, and it's leveraging its position to make customers even more loyal by speeding up service and offering a wider array of products.\n\nIt's also the global leader in cloud computing, and it's beefing up Amazon Web Services (AWS) with a massive slate of high-level AI services. It has a three-tier system to work with any kind of client, and CEO Andy Jassy pointed out that \"During the past 18 months, AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined.\"\n\nAmazon is in full growth mode, and it has many growth drivers that make it a standout stock.\n\n2. Coca-Cola: the classic Buffett stock\n\nCoca-Cola is one of three stocks that Buffett has said he would never sell. He loves its brand, dominance, and dividend, and it's his longest-held stock. In fact, when investors talk about Buffett's favorite holding period being forever, what he actually said was \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever,\" and he was talking about Coca-Cola.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola was actually under severe pressure before CEO James Quincey took over in 2017, and Buffett still held on. Having Quincey on board proved providential as Coca-Cola began to turn things around before the pandemic, and it was in good hands to weather the declines. It's well past that now and has been demonstrating resilience in the inflationary climate.\n\nCoca-Cola's growth opportunities may be more limited than that of a typical growth stock, but it continues to innovate with new beverages and product types. The company has a solid balance sheet and cash at hand, and is able to acquire smaller companies that generate some of its higher growth. Coca Cola then brings these newer drinks into its unmatched global distribution system, leading to increased presence, sales, and efficiency. It's an incredible model that leverages the strength of its core brands along with the growth potential of new ones.\n\nThe company has managed to navigate the pressures of the current environment and is well-positioned to keep its top spot as the leading global beverage company. It's also as reliable as a Dividend King can be for growing passive income.\n\n3. Ulta Beauty: the surprise Buffett stock\n\nI'm not sure that too many investors saw it coming when Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing included a new position in Ulta Beauty, but it's a stock that fits well into the Buffett mold. It has a distinctive approach to selling beauty products and has grown to an impressive almost 1,400 stores that give it a leading position against competitors trying to copy it. While it's still opening new stores, with plans for up to 65 this year, it's the loyal shoppers that are driving growth and generating opportunities for more.\n\nUlta is definitely feeling inflationary pressure right now, but its business concept is intact. It reported a tiny 1.6% increase in comparable sales in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended May 4), but what really dragged down the stock were margins and outlook. Operating margin declined from 16.8% to 14.7%, and management lowered its full-year outlook for revenue, comparable sales, operating margin, and earnings per share (EPS).\n\nIt's easy to see why Buffett picked Ulta right now. It's down 18% over the past year, and that's including the jump from after the news of Buffett's buy. At the current price, it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 14, which looks undervalued as compared with its opportunity. An industry leader at a cheap price is right up Buffett's alley, and Ulta Beauty stock looks like a great buy for any individual investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Closer Look at Retail and Nvidia Earnings",
        "content": "The Q2 earnings season has effectively come to an end, with results from more than 95% of S&P 500 members already out, with even most of the major Retail sector results known by now. That said, this week’s line-up of quarterly results from more than 140 companies, including 15 from S&P 500 members, includes quarterly results from the only Magnificent 7 member yet to report results, Nvidia NVDA.\n\nOther notable companies reporting results this week include Salesforce CRM, Lululemon LULU, Best Buy BBY and others.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a true leader of the coming artificial intelligence (AI) economy, with the company’s chips as the only game in town when it comes to running the highly complex and demanding computations. This leadership has allowed Nvidia to consistently come out with beat-and-raise quarterly reports in recent quarters.\n\nWe will see if the company can maintain this operating momentum when it reports results after the market’s close on Wednesday, August 28th. Estimates for the period have essentially remained unchanged in recent weeks, which is unusual relative to what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.\n\nNvidia is expected to bring in $0.63 in EPS on $28.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year gains of +133.3% and +109%, respectively. You can see the long-term Nvidia revisions trend in the below Price, Consensus & Surprise chart. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia shares were hit hard in the market’s recent down draft, but have effectively recouped most of those losses. The stock has more than doubled this year and handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector, the broader market, and the Mag 7 stocks, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe biggest driver of the stock’s performance from here onwards will be management guidance for the current and upcoming quarters, as well as the market’s assessment of the company’s ability to ramp up production of the Blackwell chips. There have been speculations in the market that Nvidia is faced with production snags that can delay the product’s delivery schedule.\n\nWith the stock up more than +150% this year alone, most investors will assume that valuation must be really stretched already. The actual ground reality is not that simple.\n\nNvidia shares are currently trading at 40.2X forward 12-month EPS estimates. This is almost double the comparable multiple for the S&P 500 index of 21.5X. Over the last five years, Nvidia shares have traded as high as 106.3X forward 12-month estimates, as low as 26.8X, and have a 5-year median of 50.7X.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother way to look at Nvidia's valuation is to look at the magnitude of the premium the stock is currently enjoying relative to where that premium or discount has historically been.\n\nNvidia’s current forward 12-month P/E multiple is 187% of the S&P 500 multiple. Over the last five years, the stock’s multiple has been as high as 569% and as low as 134%, with a median over this period of 248%.\n\nIn other words, the stock isn’t cheap, but it has traded at higher multiples over its history. Prediction is very difficult, particularly if it’s about the future, as someone wise once opined. Predictions for Nvidia shares require how sustainable the company’s competitive advantages are in the coming AI revolution, not to mention whether the ongoing all-around AI optimism has a solid foundation.\n\nNvidia aside, the earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector. To that end, we will be getting results this week from Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and a few other retailers.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 30 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 30 retailers account for 97.3% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\n\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 30 retailers that have reported are up +17.3% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 63.3% beating EPS estimates and only 46.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentages for these players is the low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years), and the EPS beats percentage isn’t that far from the low-point either.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 23rd, we have seen Q2 results from 478 S&P 500 members, or 95.6% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 79.9% beating EPS estimates and only 60.3% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have over 140 companies on deck to report Q2 results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week, besides the aforementioned Nvidia, include Salesforce, Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 60.3% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the few still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +3.9% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8% on +1.8% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -11.8% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.6%.\n\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.2% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index-level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.5% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 12% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "There haven't been many, if any, businesses that have ascended as rapidly as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has. The company's 2023 revenue of $575 billion was a phenomenal 108 times higher than it was 20 years prior. This is clearly a growth-focused enterprise, even at its current scale.\n\nAs of this writing, the e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut is trading 12% off its all-time high from early July this year. Here's why this creates an excellent opportunity to buy this growth stock.\n\nFinancial performance\n\nAmazon has no shortage of growth levers that it will continue to benefit from. Most investors are familiar with the company's monster success in the e-commerce niche. In the U.S., 38% of all spending that happens online goes through Amazon.com.\n\nThe rise of streaming entertainment is another tailwind that benefits the business. Amazon Prime is popular because it gives shoppers fast and free shipping. However, consumers also get access to a vast library of shows and movies. In terms of TV viewing time in the U.S., the video service is behind only Alphabet's YouTube and Netflix. More household cord-cutting will keep the engagement high.\n\nIn essence, the advent of the internet and all things digital is the key driving force for this business, which will continue to be the case going forward. This is true with other prominent segments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading global cloud computing platform. With a second-quarter operating margin of 35.5%, AWS has been a major profit driver.\n\nGiven how much website traffic Amazon.com gets, it's also a budding player in digital advertising, raking in Q2 revenue of $12.8 billion in this area. That's up 20% from the year-ago period. According to Insider Intelligence, Amazon is stealing share from the heavyweights that are Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nAmazon has historically been known for its impressive top-line growth. But investors can now get excited about its improving profitability. CEO Andy Jassy and his team have been focused on cutting expenses since 2022, laying off tens of thousands of people and working to reduce what critics thought was a bloated cost structure.\n\nOperating income almost doubled last quarter to $14.7 billion. Credit goes to sales and marketing and general and administrating expenses that were down on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAmazon's valuation\n\nThere's no question that Amazon is one of the most closely followed companies on planet Earth. Everyone knows what a dominant enterprise it is. But the stock isn't expensive by any means.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares trade at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.1. This represents a discount to its trailing five- and 10-year averages. This looks like a very reasonable entry point for prospective investors.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amazon is projected to increase revenue and earnings per share at compound annual rates of 11% and 37%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. It's always a good idea to take these forecasts with a grain of salt, but that type of upbeat outlook is very encouraging.\n\nBesides financial upside, Amazon has many powerful competitive strengths. It possesses valuable intangible assets, like its highly regarded brand, as well as the treasure trove of data it is able to collect. The online marketplace benefits from network effects. Amazon's customers, whether merchants or AWS clients, undoubtedly have switching costs if they decide to use another service. Given the company's massive scale, it certainly has cost advantages across the board, especially with its logistics operations.\n\nDon't overthink it. Amazon is a no-brainer growth stock to buy right now on the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Says Company's AI Assistant Has Saved $260M And 4.5K Developer-Years Of Work: 'It's Been A Game Changer For Us'\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy announced that their generative artificial intelligence assistant, Amazon Q, has significantly cut down software upgrade times, saving thousands of work hours.\n\nWhat Happened: Jassy shared in a LinkedIn post on Thursday that Amazon Q has been integrated into the company’s internal systems to streamline foundational software updates.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nHe noted that the average time to upgrade an application to Java 17 dropped from 50 developer days to just a few hours.\n\n“It’s been a game changer for us.”\n\nJassy highlighted that this efficiency has saved Amazon the equivalent of “4,500 developer-years of work.” He also mentioned that 79% of AI-generated code reviews were shipped without additional changes, emphasizing the tool’s accuracy.\n\nBeyond time savings, Jassy pointed out that the upgrades have enhanced security and reduced infrastructure costs, providing an estimated $260 million in annualized efficiency gains. He acknowledged that AI tools like Amazon Q boost productivity.\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\n“One of the most tedious (but critical tasks) for software development teams is updating foundational software. It's not new feature work, and it doesn't feel like you're moving the experience forward. As a result, this work is either dreaded or put off for more exciting work—or both,” Jessy said.\n\nJassy affirmed that Amazon plans to continue leveraging Amazon Q for further operations, with the Q team aiming to add more transformation capabilities for developers.\n\nTrending: This startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.\n\nWhy It Matters: Amazon Q’s success in saving thousands of work hours is a significant milestone for the company, especially given its rocky start.\n\nThe AI chatbot faced criticism for producing incorrect outputs, known as “hallucinations,” shortly after its launch. Insiders attributed these issues to a rushed deployment and the use of a less proficient version of Anthropic's Claude AI model. To address these problems, Amazon expanded its team of human reviewers to manually fine-tune the chatbot's outputs.\n\nDespite these early setbacks, Amazon Q has shown remarkable progress. In April, Jassy highlighted the potential of Amazon Q to revolutionize software development, particularly in helping developers transition from Microsoft Windows to Linux. He noted that the AI chatbot could save developers months by facilitating the move from older versions of Java to newer, more secure ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This startup aims to convince the FDA that Cannabis and Psilocybin can be a better alternative to synthetic pharmaceuticals on the market. Right now you can can invest in while it’s still less than $2/share.\n\nMoreover, the broader implications of AI in coding were discussed by Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman in June. He suggested that AI could soon dominate coding tasks, fundamentally changing what it means to be a developer by 2025.\n\nAmazon’s advancements in AI have also caught the attention of investors. Stephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist & Portfolio Manager at Hightower Advisors, recently doubled down on Amazon stock, citing the company’s multi-billion dollar run rate in AI as a key factor.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) a Good E-Commerce Stock to Invest In Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best E-Commerce Stocks To Invest In.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other e-commerce stocks.\n\nAn Overview of the E-Commerce Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Forbes, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $7.9 trillion by 2027 from $6.3 trillion in 2024. In 2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to be made online, up from 20.1% in 2024.\n\nAn increase in consumer confidence, after a period of sluggish growth, has been a key catalyst in improving the position of the e-commerce industry. On July 30, Reuters reported that the consumer confidence index, in the US, increased to 100.3 in July after it was revised down to 97.8 in June. Previously, experts predicted the index to fall to 99.7 after reaching 100.4 basis points. Chief Economist, Dana Peterson, suggested that while consumers remain resilient they are concerned over rising prices and interest rates. However, despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment, e-commerce companies are taking advantage of the current consumer sentiment by reducing prices. Companies like Target have also revised their profits for FY 2024 as lowered prices have drawn more customers.\n\nTo shed light on the state of online retail, US Mastercard Economics Institute Chief Economist, Michelle Meyer appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance on August 16. Online retail sales went up by 8.2% in July, compared to a 2.9% growth rate in July 2023. She further explains that personal finances, time efficacy, and the overall state of the labor market impact which sites consumers choose to shop from. Meyer also added that in the past quarter, the average individual in the United States saw an appreciation in wealth, which has a positive bearing on consumer spending and therefore online retail.\n\nWhat Does the Competitive E-Commerce Landscape look like?\n\nThe future of e-commerce is unpredictable. Bans on products from China, questions about cheap labor, criticism over fast fashion, and the increasing use of technology are different forces shaping the industry. In the first quarter of 2024, the US pushed to ban TikTok in the country, which mongered fear among Chinese e-commerce sites such as Shein and Temu. In April, law-making agencies in the US suggested a ban on Temu over labor rights infringement. Moreover, on August 21, Shein sued Temu over copyright infringements. The former suggested that Temu stole the company's designs and trade secrets resulting in Temu losing money over every sale. Despite such, the founder of Temu, Colin Huang, stands as the wealthiest person in China with a net worth of $51.4 billion, as of August 22. You can also take a look at the best Chinese stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the other hand, e-commerce sites in the United States are trying to win against their competitors using advanced technology. Walmart, for instance, launched a generative AI search tool that customers can prompt and get a list of ideal products or items needed. For example, a customer who wants to throw a birthday party, but is unaware of the items needed, could use the search tool to save time. Similarly, Amazon launched Rufus, an AI shopping assistant, earlier this year. Rufus is capable of personally assisting a shopper and helping them find the right products. While we discuss technology, we cannot ignore eBay's magical listing tool for sellers backed by artificial intelligence. The tool can analyze images, categories, and titles to curate product descriptions, prices, and shipping costs.

You can also read our piece on the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 10 best e-commerce stocks to invest in, we looked at holdings of e-commerce ETFs and screened for Internet Retail companies on the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our screen by market cap and looked at the 20 largest e-commerce companies. We picked stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of August 22.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest e-commerce and technology companies in the world. Amazon, functional in more than 20 countries, entered the e-commerce space in 1994 and now ships to more than 100 countries and regions. Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) customers include small to medium-sized businesses and mass consumers. Other than e-commerce, the company also specializes in cloud services, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the largest e-commerce companies in the United States, holding 37.6% of e-commerce sales, the highest among all its competitors. It has a unique business model, under which its retail segment in North America and Internationally made $352.8 billion and $131.2 billion in revenue respectively, for the fiscal year ended 2023 (inclusive of advertising and subscription revenue).\n\nThe company’s economic moat lies in its strong e-commerce infrastructure that allows consumers to meet all their shopping needs under one roof. The website, Amazon.com, is optimized such that customers can make purchases in less than 3 minutes and choose from over 300 million products including electronics, clothing, home appliances, and furniture. New tech features such as Amazon Lens and the Amazon AI shopping assistant have also enabled faster shopping.\n\nThe company’s delivery times are also exceptional. In March this year, 60% of prime members received their orders on the same day or the next day in the largest metro areas in the United States. On July 30, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported that, so far this year, the company has delivered almost 5 billion items on the same day or the next globally, up by 30% year-over-year.\n\nIn 2023, brand owners grew their sales by over 22%, and over 4.5 billion items were sold in the US. Overall, Amazon expects consumer activity to grow in 2024 as it spends more to improve its e-commerce infrastructure and simplify the customer journey.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 22% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Managementwas the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.46 billion.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital's Diamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best e-commerce stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The Teamsters are claiming a significant victory out of a regional NLRB decision. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nThe Teamsters are cheering a decision by a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board that Amazon is a joint employer at a delivery service partner (DSP) in California that recognized a Teamsters local’s representation of the DSP’s drivers.\n\nWhile the decision has not yet been published by the NLRB, the Teamsters said its delivery drivers who are represented by Local 396 in Palmdale, California, had won a victory at the NLRB’s Region 31 board, which operates in Los Angeles.\n\n“After more than a year-long investigation, [the regional board] found that Amazon is a joint employer of its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) drivers and therefore has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters union,” the union said in a prepared statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for the union said it had been informed by NLRB personnel about the decision.\n\nThe workers were employed by a DSP called Battle Tested Strategies (BTS). They voted last year to be represented by the Teamsters through a card check process, and the company recognized the union. Amazon soon after yanked the DSP contract with BTS.\n\nAmazon Teamsters Win Monumental NLRB Ruling: Amazon Drivers are Amazon Workers!\r\n\r\nAmazon delivery drivers represented by Teamsters Local 396 in Palmdale, Calif., won a groundbreaking decision that sets the stage for Amazon delivery drivers across the country to organize with the… pic.twitter.com/kcEnjC8D4x\n\n— Teamsters (@Teamsters) August 22, 2024\n\nAmazon has long held that drivers delivering goods ordered from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) do not work for the logistics and retailing giant. Rather, they are employees of their DSPs, who have been granted the right by Amazon to serve a defined area.\n\nBut the decision by the regional board of the NLRB rejects that finding.\n\nAnd in an acknowledgement of the stakes that the decision raises, the union said in its statement that it is “confident the NLRB’s regional determination for the Palmdale workers will extend to Amazon DSP drivers who unionize nationwide.”\n\nThe NLRB regional board issued a complaint against Amazon that will be heard at a trial before an NLRB administrative law judge in Los Angeles, according to Julie Gutman Dickson, a partner at the law firm of Bush Gottlieb in Los Angeles and a longtime outside counsel for the Teamsters.\n\nDickson said whatever decision comes out of that trial could be appealed to the full NLRB in Washington. She said there was no firm estimate on when the trial might be scheduled.\n\nStory continues\n\n“There are huge, huge legal implications, because we believe the model in Palmdale is the same as DSPs throughout the country,” Dickson said. The regional decision “sets the stage” for a legal process that could determine that Amazon is a joint employer with the DSPs, “and will have a duty to recognize and bargain with any union that represents the majority of those employees.”\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from FreightWaves.\n\nHowever, in comments to the Los Angeles Times, an Amazon spokeswoman said the NLRB had dismissed “most of the Teamsters’ more significant claims.”\n\n“As they have been for over 15 months, the Teamsters continue to misrepresent what is happening here,” Eileen Hards told the newspaper. “As we have said all along, there is no merit to the Teamsters’ claims. If and when the agency decides it wants to litigate the remaining allegations, we expect they will be dismissed as well.”\n\nBut the Teamsters painted a different picture of the as-yet-unpublished decision.\n\n“The NLRB Region in Los Angeles also found that Amazon engaged in a long list of egregious unfair labor practices at its Palmdale facility, including unlawfully refusing to recognize the workers’ decision to unionize with the Teamsters; failing and refusing to bargain with the Teamsters over conditions of employment and the effects of its decision to terminate its DSP’s contract; threatening employees with job loss; holding unlawful captive audience meetings; intimidating employees with security guards; and other illegal retaliation against the group of newly unionized workers,” the union said in its statement.\n\nThe reality on the ground for the roughly 85 BST workers at Palmdale who voted to unionize is that they have been on strike since April 2023 against an employer who had its DSP status revoked.\n\nThe Teamsters also are fighting a case before the NLRB with parallels to the Battle Tested case.\n\nA DSP in Skokie, Illinois, Four Star Express Delivery, saw its roughly 100 drivers vote earlier this year to be represented by Teamsters Local 705. They struck in late June. The end result was a layoff notice and the termination by Amazon of the Four Star contract to be a DSP.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nVirginia carrier’s win against union may ultimately give labor a boost at NLRB\n\nTeamsters voted in to represent drivers at Kroger fulfillment center, say it’s a first\n\nTeamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections\n\nThe post Teamsters say NLRB decision undercuts Amazon delivery ownership model, could boost unionization appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now, and 2 to Wait for a Pullback",
        "content": "Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it, or so the saying goes. Wise words and sage advice for investors. When the market seems to be making new all-time highs weekly, and there is tremendous enthusiasm on Wall Street and in the world of amateur investors, it can feel as if stocks will go up forever and valuations are irrelevant. But this is when investors should be cautious.\n\nThe most recent example is the 2021 tech bubble. The economy was flush with economic stimulus, interest rates were near zero, and stocks traded for ridiculous valuations. For example, edge-computing company Cloudflare's (NYSE: NET) stock valuation reached an astounding 114 times sales, as shown below. NET PS Ratio Chart\n\nAs you can see, it now trades at a more reasonable 19 times sales, and the stock is down 62% from its all-time high. And guess what? Cloudflare is a terrific company but wasn't a great investment at that high valuation.\n\nThere are undervalued and overvalued stocks in the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Here's where I stand on three popular companies.\n\nAmazon stock looks like a terrific value.\n\nAmazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock dipped after its second-quarter earnings report as top-line growth disappointed. Total sales increased 10% to $148 billion, and guidance for Q3 forecast an increase of just 8% to 11%. Product sales were the anchor, increasing just 4% in the quarter.\n\nConsumer spending is slowing economy-wide by design. Interest rates remain above 5% as the Federal Reserve tames inflation. Some investors are concerned about a potential recession and a further decline in consumer spending. However, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower rates soon. In addition, most of Amazon's profits come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), not product sales.\n\nAWS is the straw that stirs the drink for Amazon, and growth is back. As depicted below, AWS' sales growth has accelerated for four straight quarters after a down year in 2023. Data source: Amazon.\n\nCloud data providers, like AWS, will continue to see growth driven by AI data needs and the continued migration to the cloud.\n\nAmazon stock is undervalued on multiple measures. My preferred metric is price-to-cash from operations. In other words, what am I paying for the cash produced by the business's core operations? The stock hasn't been this inexpensive by this metric in more than 10 years, as shown below, and it is 50% off the 10-year average. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nGiven AWS' accelerating growth, brisk AI tailwinds, and the stock's historical undervaluation, Amazon now looks like a terrific long-term value.\n\nStory continues\n\nTwo great companies looking too pricy\n\nAI has tremendous coattails, and Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) and Palantir(NYSE: PLTR) are riding them to lofty valuations.\n\nArm Holdings designs the \"architecture\" for semiconductors sold by the biggest names in tech. More than 99% of smartphones use its technology, and the company reported that 287 billion Arm-based chips have been sold to date. It expects 100 billion more to be shipped by the end of fiscal 2026. The company earns royalty income and license fees from companies that use its designs. It will benefit tremendously from the rise in AI, which requires high-powered chips.\n\nRevenue was up 39% last quarter to $939 million, and Arm expects sales of $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion this fiscal year with $1.45 to $1.65 in diluted earnings per share. These are excellent results, but they still don't justify the current valuation. Arm trades at nearly 40 times sales and 85 times forward earnings.\n\nThis is much too pricey for me; however, I would love to repurchase this stock should it pull back to under 25 times sales.\n\nPalantir helps companies harness massive amounts of data so that their customers can visualize, analyze, and use their data to make better decisions. It has a strong foothold with government customers, mainly defense departments, and is proliferating in the private sector. Its new Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) helped grow its commercial customer count by 83% year over year last quarter to 295. Revenue rose 27% to $678 million, and Palantir is consistently profitable now.\n\nHowever, just like Arm, the valuation doesn't allow for much room for error. Palantir's price-to-sales ratio of 31 is its highest since the 2021 tech bubble and is 60% above its historical average, as shown below.

Patient investors will likely have a better entry point.\n\nAI fervor is real, and so are the significant tailwinds for Amazon, Arm, and Palantir. However, valuations are still crucial in the long run.

        "title": "Why Shorting GameStop Remains a High-Risk Bet",
        "content": "GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), once emblematic of the retail sector's struggles, has executed a turnaround that defies conventional expectations. Guided by an unorthodox CEO and largest shareholder, the company now boasts a balance sheet fortified with cash and minimal debt. This remarkable shift has been driven by what could be one of the most significant fundraising efforts in stock market history.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with GME.\n\nIn this analysis, I will delve into GameStop's transition from pandemic-induced turmoil to a robust financial position and examine why betting against this stock might now be still precarious.\n\nThe largest fundraiser in history\n\nGameStop today defies the logic of retail, where a business that does not grow often means it does not survive. That is because with competition at an all-time high, increasing profits and expanding operations simply implies staying competitive, not collapsing.\n\nWhen we look at GameStop's business, since 2018, annual revenues have been in freefall (with a brief exception in 2022, when the trend briefly corrected itself). But perhaps in the whole world, GameStop is the only case of a company that has increased its cash and equivalents by more than 50% when it has reduced its revenue by about 40% in the last decade, as noted in the graph below. Why Shorting GameStop Remains a High-Risk Bet\n\nGME Data by GuruFocus\n\nHow was this possible? Through probably the biggest fundraiser in stock market history.\n\nIn 2020, a year gripped by the chaos of the Covid-19 pandemic, the markets witnessed one of the biggest crashes in their history. During the height of the pandemic, the S&P 500 (SPY) suffered one of the fastest and steepest falls. Between Feb. 19 and March 23, 2020, the index fell by around 34%. Retail stocks in particular had mixed reactions after that. E-commerce companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), for example, saw their shares rise significantly, reflecting the increase in demand for online shopping and delivery services.\n\nCompanies with a strong presence in physical stores, such as Macy's (NYSE:M), JC Penney (JCPNQ) and Gap (GPS), initially suffered from falling sales and lockdowns, resulting in sharp declines in their share prices. However, essential retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), which already had robust e-commerce channels, were able to adapt quickly.\n\nGameStop, for not having a robust e-commerce channel and being a brick-and-mortar store, took the biggest hit. But the truth was that the stock had been in tatters since 2018. As a result, bears betting heavily against the stock will raise the company's short interest beyond 100% at some point (possibly given that the shares have been repeatedly borrowed and sold).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2019, for example, the negative pressure on GameStop was so strong that even famed trader Michael Burry (Trades, Portfolio) bought a sizable position after considering the high short interest in the stock and realizing that the business was undervalued. Burry even sent letters to GameStop management, recommending the repurchase of $238 million worth of shares.\n\nIt was then that, sometime later, an unknown trader named Keith Gill (also known as Roaring Kitty), who was just another YouTuber spreading his content, began to draw attention to a thesis similar to that of Burry. Shortly afterward, former Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) CEO and founder Ryan Cohen bought around 10% of the company's shares, becoming its largest shareholder. Parallel to this, at a time of pandemic when trillion-dollar fiscal stimulus packages were being poured into the economy and an entire world population was locked indoors, a flood of new retail investors entered the market.\n\nFueled by commission-free brokers like Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), investing and trading were democratized and social media platforms like Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) served as the stage for a kind of orchestrated trade to squeeze GameStop short sellers. The result was GameStop shares jumping quadruple digits in a few days in early 2021 along with a few other stocks, particularly those with a similar profile to GameStop, a legacy business struggling with the modernization of the industry. Why Shorting GameStop Remains a High-Risk Bet\n\nWhat happened next was what any decaying business would do if its share price jumped: sell equity. GameStop raised around $1.67 billion worth of shares and used this amount to clear its debts and strengthen its balance sheet.\n\nOver time, Cohen proved to be the activist investor he is, rising to the position of chair of GameStop's board, shaking up management and electing executives he trusts. After a few years of volatility, attempts to turn the business around and speculation about its future plans, he became the company's CEO, leading it to profitability for the first time since 2018 through severe cost-cutting measures.\n\nBut from the peak in January 2021 until April 2024, GameStop shares had lost more than 87% of their value. It turns out that just when you thought the story had gone too far and that the natural tendency was for short sellers to bet against the company until it became a penny stock again, in 2024 there was a new twist.\n\nGill, the same guy who initially sparked the GameStop frenzy, reappeared after more than three years in obscurity, announcing a massive bet on the video game retaileraround 5 million GameStop shares and 120,000 call options. The result? Another short squeeze, though on a smaller scale this time, with shares jumping almost 400% in just a few weeks.\n\nThis was the perfect opportunity for Cohen and his team to sell equity and strengthen the company's balance sheet once and for all. In May, GameStop sold 45 million shares, raising $933 million in cash. And they didn't stop there.\n\nOn June 7, after another massive surge, GameStop sold an additional 75 million shares, raising another $2.10 billion. Adding this to the company's cash balance, GameStop now has approximately $4 billion on its balance sheet with virtually no debt.\n\nWhat's the plan for all this cash?\n\nGameStop's unconventional management has revealed little about its future plans. However, the funds raised from equity sales may be used to transform it into a holding company.\n\nAccording to quarterly filings, GameStop disclosed its board of directors approved a new investment policy. This policy gives the CEO and largest individual shareholder, which is Cohen, the authority to invest in equity securities and other financial instruments. In other words, it seems the strategy is to invest outside the core business, which makes sense given sales have been declining for the past five years.\n\nEven so, the success of this strategy is uncertain. It will require a keen investment vision from Cohen and his team, akin to Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s approach. Meanwhile, until more details about these new investment avenues are revealed, it appears the company's management will focus on operating efficiently, cutting costs and aiming for profitability, even if it is just breakeven.\n\nAlthough this plan may sound unconventional, making a bullish case for it is not impossible. The major hurdle is that investors are currently paying a staggering multiple of 257 times enterprise value/Ebitda for this bet, which seems far detached from reality.\n\nSo why not short GameStop stock?\n\nRight now, 10.70% of GameStop's float is shorted, which is a lot less than in recent years. This suggests two things: short sellers have learned from the past and the chances of a short squeeze are much lower.\n\nThe narrative around GameStop might also be shifting from betting against to transformation and growth potential. This could attract a different type of investorone more focused on fundamentals and long-term strategies.\n\nWith the mystery of Roaring Kitty mostly resolved (and already covered this year), I do not think it will significantly impact the share price again. The most likely source of volatility would be related to Cohen's efforts to turn GameStop into a holding company, which, in my view, seems pretty dubious.\n\nBut more than anything, it is tough to bet against a stock with such a volatile history, a strong balance sheet (especially with all those equity sales), no debt and a business that is not losing money. This makes the idea of betting against GameStop based on extremely high valuations seem shaky, especially since valuations have mattered very little to the investment thesis in recent years.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nGameStop's transformation from a struggling retailer to a cash-rich contender is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nThe company has cleverly used equity sales to strengthen its balance sheet, positioning itself with solid cash reserves and minimal debt. As Cohen steers GameStop toward becoming a holding company, the future is a mix of uncertainty and potential. With short interest at a modest 10.70% (given its history) and the stock's swings tied to strategic shifts, betting against it now seems a high-stakes gamble. The strong financial footing and near profitability make the stock a tough target for shorts, adding a layer of complexity to any bearish bets.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett's recent investment in Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) may face a rocky start, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa)'s new stake in the beauty retailer, Citi anticipates that Ulta Beauty is likely to miss its earnings targets for the second quarter of 2024, citing several factors.\n\nAs a result, the firm opened a 90-day negative catalyst watch on the stock, lowering the price target to $375 from $400 a share. However, they maintained a Neutral rating on the stock.\n\nCiti analysts expect Ulta to report weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with an anticipated EPS miss when the company releases its results on August 29 after the close.\n\n\"We anticipate a 2Q EPS miss vs consensus driven by weaker comps and lower gross margin,\" Citi stated.\n\nThey project flat same-store sales (compared to the consensus expectation of a 1.4% increase) and a gross margin decline of 120 basis points, far worse than the 50 basis point decline anticipated by the market.\n\nThe analysts point to weakening trends in the beauty category and heightened competition as key challenges.\n\nSpecifically, they note the increased presence of Sephora in Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Estée Lauder selling to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Ulta's own partnership with Target, which may be making it harder for Ulta to drive traffic.\n\nTo counter these headwinds, Citi believes that Ulta may have to increase promotional and marketing efforts in the second half of the year, which could further pressure margins.\n\nThe investment bank also forecasts that Ulta will lower its full-year guidance, with EPS expected to be revised down to approximately $24.50 from the previous range of $25.20 to $26.00.\n\nAdditionally, Citi expects the company to lower its long-term margin targets during its analyst day in October from the current 14-15% range to around 13%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuffett's new stock pick likely to deliver an earnings miss: Citi\n\nAnalysis-Ozempic on Wall Street's list for 2027 Medicare drug negotiations\n\nEarnings call: OSI Systems posts record Q4 revenue, eyes growth in FY2025\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The stock market is full of growing companies that can help you build lasting wealth. The best investments are those you can buy and never need to sell, since uninterrupted compound interest can lead to incredible gains down the road. To help you in your search, here are two outstanding growth stocks to buy today.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an ideal stock to consider holding forever. It not only benefits from repeat spending behavior from millions of Prime members, but importantly, the company is obsessed with the customer experience that is pushing it to deliver more convenience and value.\n\nAfter falling with the market indexes in 2022, the stock hit new all-time highs this year. The company has made significant improvements to inventory management, which is now driving record free cash flow and profits. This effort is still ongoing, which could lead to significant gains for shareholders in the coming years.\n\nAmazon delivered more than 7 billion items to customers in 2023 in the same or next day. Faster delivery speeds follow the reorganization of inventory across its fulfillment centers to put items closer to customers. This has reduced delivery costs and encouraged customers to buy more frequently.\n\nAmazon's free cash flow totaled nearly $53 billion over the last year. Its operating profit nearly doubled year over year in the second quarter, and it should continue to see a growing profit contribution from its highly lucrative non-retail services, including cloud services and sponsored ads, which generate most of the company's operating profit.\n\nEven after the monster rally last year, the shares are still fairly priced. Using Amazon's trailing revenue, the stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.1. That is right in line with its 10-year average of 3.2 times trailing sales. It's also trading at a price-to-free cash flow multiple of 39, which is consistent with the stock's trading history.\n\nOverall, these metrics indicate a fairly priced stock that should continue to deliver a return roughly in line with the growth of Amazon's business.\n\n2. Netflix\n\nSubscription-based businesses can be very rewarding investments because of the built-in repeat spending of subscribers and the lucrative profits it produces for the business over time. This is why Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) is a resilient business that can deliver compounding returns to investors for many years.\n\nNetflix benefits from a growing paid membership base of 277 million, which rose 16% in Q2 over the year-ago quarter. It has built a top brand in digital entertainment, but the real advantage for Netflix is the billions it had to spend over several years to reach this status.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, Netflix spent almost $50 billion on content. Building a large library of original movies and shows is very capital intensive, which is why Walt Disney is still trying to turn a profit in its streaming business.\n\nHowever, Netflix can afford it and still show a healthy profit to fuel shareholder returns. Its trailing 12-month profit was $7 billion on $36 billion of revenue, and management is committed to further margin increases over the long term.\n\nNetflix has years of data on what subscribers like to watch and for how many hours. Management can predict how many hours viewers will watch of each show or film over its useful life. The value of its brand and data science capabilities explains why Netflix continues to grow its subscriber base and reward shareholders.\n\nThe stock is currently sitting close to new highs but still trades at a fair valuation relative to business fundamentals. The stock's price-to-free cash flow ratio is sitting at 44, and its forward price-to-earnings ratio is currently 35.\n\nConsidering the company's margin expansion potential and opportunities to reach millions of more households globally, Netflix stock is a solid buy-and-hold investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Cheapest Trillion-Dollar Stock: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta?",
        "content": "Six U.S. companies are valued at $1 trillion or more, and they all operate in the technology sector:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.44 trillion Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): $3.16 trillion Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): $3.14 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $2.07 trillion Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.87 trillion Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): $1.33 trillion\n\nAll of these companies are profitable, so they can be valued with the widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It's calculated by dividing the share price of a given company by its earnings per share. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.9, which is a good reference point: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia is the most expensive trillion-dollar stock today on a P/E basis. However, the company is growing so quickly it has a forward P/E ratio of just 33.1 based on next year's earnings forecast. In other words, its valuation is much more reasonable if investors are willing to hold it for a couple of years.\n\nThe cheapest stock of the group is Alphabet. A judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, and the U.S. Department of Justice wants to break up the company to resolve that issue. It could take years -- if it happens at all -- but combined with growing competition from artificial intelligence chatbots, which are threatening the dominance of Google Search, investors are treading cautiously with respect to Alphabet's valuation.\n\nFinally, Amazon deserves a mention. It's on track to generate $635 billion in revenue this year, which is more than any of its peers, and it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue). Plus, its earnings are forecast to grow 63% this year and 23% in 2025, so its elevated P/E ratio might actually be justified.\n\nIn summary, a P/E ratio alone isn't always the best indicator of value. Investors could easily make the case that despite trading at triple the P/E ratio, Nvidia stock is a better buy than Alphabet because of its rapid growth (and Alphabet's regulatory headwinds).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Reuters) - State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.\n\nProviding access to such technologies through the cloud is not a violation of U.S. regulations.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: \"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China.\"\n\nFollowing is a list of Chinese entities that sought access to restricted U.S. technologies through the cloud, according to the documents that were reviewed by Reuters.\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing AI models and computing power via AWS:\n\n1. Zhejiang Lab\n\nThe state-run research institute is developing its own large-language model, GeoGPT, and said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan ($25,760) to purchase AWS cloud computing services, as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba. The institute told Reuters that it did not go through with the purchase but did not say why. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not determine if the purchase had been completed.\n\n2. National Center of Technology Innovation for EDA\n\nThe state-backed entity, which helps Chinese companies develop chip design blueprints for mass production, said in an April tender document it spent 600,000 yuan to buy an overseas AWS account for the purpose of accessing Claude 3, an AI model developed by Anthropic. Anthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude. The center did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEntities accessing advanced U.S. chips via AWS:\n\n1. Shenzhen University\n\nShenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. Exports to China of the two Nvidia chips are banned by the U.S.\n\nShenzhen University got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed. The university and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.\n\n2. Fujian Chuanzheng Communications College\n\nThe vocational college backed by the Fujian provincial government spent 85,000 yuan in August last year on an AWS account that would give it access to clusters made up of over 4,000 Nvidia A100 chips. The supplier was Xiamen Hanwei Software Technology Ltd Co, according to the August tender document.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe college said in the tender document that the purchase was designed to \"keep pace with the latest developments in cloud computing technology...and enhance the quality of cloud computing talent training and professional development at educational institutions.\"\n\nThe college and Xiamen Hanwei did not respond to requests for comment. An AWS spokesperson said \"the vast majority of this small tender pertained to skills training, and the very small portion that related to cloud services did not use any of the restricted AI chips.\"\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing OpenAI tools via Microsoft's Azure\n\n1. Chongqing Changan Automobile Co\n\nThe state-owned car maker said in May last year it was looking for a retailer authorised by Microsoft that could set up Azure OpenAI accounts and integrate generative AI technology into the company's systems and applications. The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether it went through with the purchase. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment and Reuters could not determine whether the purchase went through.\n\n2. Sichuan University\n\nIn April, Sichuan University said it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Azure OpenAI tokens in order to support the delivery of this project. The supplier was Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd, a May tender document showed. The Chinese entities and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOpenAI said in a statement its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft’s policies. It did not comment on the tenders.\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing U.S. chips via cloud services\n\n1. Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)\n\nThe USTC institute said in a March filing that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider and Reuters could not determine its identity.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department added USTC to its Entity List in May 2024 for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China’s military, and involvement in its nuclear program development.\n\nUSTC did not respond to a request for comment on the transaction and on being put on the entity list.\n\n2. Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)\n\nThe university's Department of Computer Science bought in April four months of usage time on a server powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips by paying 196,000 yuan to Shenzhen Yunbing Technology Co Ltd for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe university's Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering was added in February 2022 to the Unverified List, which means parties that engage in business with the department must take additional compliance steps to address U.S. concerns about potential national security risks.\n\nSUSTech and Shenzhen Yunbing did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n3. Tsinghua University\n\nOne of the most frequent state-affiliated buyers of banned Nvidia chips said in November 2023 that it planned to spend almost half a million yuan to rent 10 or more servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, to provide AI computing power for an unspecified purpose. The contract was awarded to Beijing Parallel Technology Co Ltd, a Reuters check showed. Neither entity responded to a request for comment.\n\n4. China Coal Research Institute\n\nA major R&D hub for China's coal industry, the institute said in June it wanted to purchase four servers powered by Nvidia A100 chips. The institute did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not establish if the purchase went ahead.\n\n5.

        "title": "Exclusive-Chinese entities turn to Amazon cloud and its rivals to access high-end US chips, AI",
        "content": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld\n\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.\n\nThe U.S. government has restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China over the past two years, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities.\n\nProviding access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud, however, is not a violation of U.S. regulations since only exports or transfers of a commodity, software or technology are regulated.\n\nA Reuters review of more than 50 tender documents posted over the past year on publicly available Chinese databases showed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted U.S. technologies or cloud services.\n\nAmong those, four explicitly named Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud service provider, though they accessed the services through Chinese intermediary companies rather than from AWS directly.\n\nThe tender documents, which Reuters is the first to report on, show the breadth of strategies Chinese entities are employing to secure advanced computing power and access generative AI models. They also underscore how U.S. companies are capitalising on China's growing demand for computing power.\n\n\"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China,\" a spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business said.\n\nAWS controls nearly a third of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to research firm Canalys. In China, AWS is the sixth-largest cloud service provider, according to research firm IDC.\n\nShenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan ($27,996) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. It got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed.\n\nExports to China of the two Nvidia chips, which are used to power large-language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are banned by the U.S.\n\nShenzhen University and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.\n\nZhejiang Lab, a research institute developing its own LLM, GeoGPT, said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan to purchase AWS cloud computing services as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spokesperson for Zhejiang Lab said that it did not follow through with the purchase but did not respond to questions about the reasoning behind this decision or how it met its LLM's computing power requirements. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReuters could not establish whether or not the purchase went ahead.\n\nThe U.S. government is now trying to tighten regulations to restrict access through the cloud.\n\n\"This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it,\" Michael McCaul, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in a statement, referring to the remote access of advanced U.S. computing through the cloud by foreign entities.\n\nLegislation was introduced in Congress in April to empower the commerce department to regulate remote access of U.S. technology, but it is not clear if and when it will be passed.\n\nA department spokesperson said it was working closely with Congress and \"seeking additional resources to strengthen our existing controls that restrict PRC companies from accessing advanced AI chips through remote access to cloud computing capability.\"\n\nThe commerce department also proposed a rule in January that would require U.S. cloud computing services to verify large AI model users and report to regulators when they use U.S. cloud computing services to train large AI models capable of \"malicious cyber-enabled activity\".\n\nThe rule, which has not been finalized, would also enable the commerce secretary to impose prohibitions on customers.\n\n\"We are aware the commerce department is considering new regulations, and we comply with all applicable laws in the countries in which we operate,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\n\nCLOUD DEMAND IN CHINA\n\nThe Chinese entities are also seeking access to Microsoft's cloud services.\n\nIn April, Sichuan University said in a tender document it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Microsoft Azure OpenAI tokens to support the delivery of this project. The university's procurement document in May showed that Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd supplied the tokens.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to requests for comment. Sichuan University and Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology did not respond to requests for comment on the purchase.\n\nOpenAI said in a statement its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft's policies. It did not comment on the tenders.\n\nThe University of Science and Technology of China's (USTC) Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research said in a tender document in March that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider and Reuters could not determine its identity.\n\nUSTC was added to a U.S. export control list known as the 'Entity List' in May for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China's military, and involvement in its nuclear program development.\n\nUSTC and Hefei Advanced Computing Center did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBEYOND RESTRICTED AI CHIPS\n\nAmazon has offered Chinese organisations access not only to advanced AI chips but also to advanced AI models such as Anthropic's Claude which they cannot otherwise access, according to public posts, tenders and marketing materials reviewed by Reuters.\n\n\"Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic's Claude 3,\" Chu Ruisong, President of AWS Greater China, told a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May, referring to its cloud platform.\n\nIn various Chinese-language posts for AWS developers and clients, Amazon highlighted the opportunity to try out \"world-class AI models\" and mentioned Chinese gaming firm Source Technology as one of its clients using Claude.\n\nAmazon has dedicated sales teams serving Chinese clients domestically and overseas, according to two former company executives.\n\nAfter Reuters contacted Amazon for comment, it updated dozens of posts on its Chinese-language channels with a note to say some of its services were not available in its China cloud regions. It also removed several promotional posts, including the one about Source Technology. Amazon did not give a reason for removing the posts and did not answer a Reuters query on that.\n\n\"Amazon Bedrock customers are subject to Anthropic's end user license agreement, which prohibits access to Claude in China both via Amazon's Bedrock API (application programming interface) and via Anthropic's own API,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\n\nAnthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude.\n\n\"However, subsidiaries or product divisions of Chinese-headquartered companies may use Claude if the subsidiary itself is located in a supported region outside of China,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said.\n\nSource Technology did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n($1 = 7.1440 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld; Additional reporting by Krystal Hu, Alexandra Alper and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Delivery drivers at third-party company in Palmdale are Amazon employees, NLRB finds",
        "content": "Workers at a company that delivered packages for Amazon are considered employees of the e-commerce giant, the National Labor Relations Board said Thursday, rejecting Amazon's claim that it is not responsible for the subcontractor's staff.\n\nThe finding, issued by a regional director of the NLRB in Los Angeles, determined there was merit to accusations by the delivery workers that Amazon unlawfully refused to recognize their decision to unionize and failed to negotiate with the union over workplace issues. The NLRB also found Amazon had threatened employees, inappropriately required workers to attend meetings meant to disparage union activity, and failed to provide information requested by the union.\n\nThe delivery company, Battle-Tested Strategies, operated out of Amazon's DAX8 fulfillment center in Palmdale. The company's owner, Johnathon Ervin, voluntarily recognized the decision by drivers to organize and join a local chapter of the Teamsters union. Amazon ended the company's contract last year, effectively terminating the jobs of the 84 drivers who delivered Amazon packages.\n\nThe findings marked a win for Teamsters officials who challenged a stance long held by Amazon, that it does not exercise control over its subcontracted drivers and so bears no legal responsibility for their working conditions. It could open the door to delivery drivers elsewhere unionizing and demanding Amazon come to the bargaining table.\n\n“Amazon drivers have taken their future into their own hands and won a monumental determination that makes clear Amazon has a legal obligation to bargain with its drivers over their working conditions,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien in a statement on Thursday. “This strike has paved the way for every other Amazon worker in the country to demand what they deserve and to get Amazon to the bargaining table.”\n\nThe NLRB did not find merit to all of the Teamsters' allegations, however. It dismissed, for example, a claim that Amazon's decision to end its contract with Battle-Tested Strategies was retaliatory.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said the NLRB had dismissed \"most of the Teamsters’ more significant claims.\"\n\n“As they have been for over 15 months, the Teamsters continue to misrepresent what is happening here,\" Hards said. \"As we have said all along, there is no merit to the Teamsters’ claims. If and when the agency decides it wants to litigate the remaining allegations, we expect they will be dismissed as well.”\n\nEver since the Battle-Tested Strategies drivers were terminated last June, the Teamsters have held protests at the Palmdale facility as well as at other Amazon warehouses across the country.\n\nIn a statement released by the union, Jessie Moreno, a driver in Palmdale, said: “Amazon can no longer dodge responsibility for our low wages and dangerous working conditions, and it cannot continue to get away with committing unfair labor practices.\"\n\n\"We are uniting Amazon workers across the country like never before,\" Moreno said.\n\nThe NLRB's finding represents a first step in the board's process for litigating allegations of wrongdoing and comes after an investigation into the workers' claims that Amazon was engaging in unfair labor practices, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said in an email.\n\nBlado said that if Amazon and the Teamsters do not now reach a settlement in the case, the labor agency would issue a formal complaint based on its findings. After that, the case would be heard by an administrative law judge, who could order the company to implement remedies. The judge's decision could then be appealed to the labor board in Washington.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What's Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Thursday?\n\nArtificial intelligence server company Super Micro Computer, Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock is trading lower Thursday in sympathy with the broader semiconductor selloff led by its clients, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nDespite the selloff, analysts continue to hail Nvidia as the critical AI play, implying the continued potential for the AI frenzy. The selloff has rendered the valuation of the semiconductor companies as more attractive entry points.\n\nSuper Micro Computer stock has increased 136% in the last 12 months and is currently trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 13.73x. Nvidia, up 176%, is currently trading at a 33.16 PE multiple.\n\nRecently, Taiwanese rail kit supplier Nan Juen International Co, a Super Micro Computer partner, inked a deal with Nvidia to ramp up rail kit production for GB200 AI servers.\n\nThe market value of AI servers has the potential to surpass $187 billion in 2024, implying a growth rate of 69% driven by the demand for advanced AI servers from major CSPs and brand clients, as per TrendForce.\n\nThe market potential for AI servers backed by demand from Big Tech giants, including Nvidia, AMD, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Amazon Web Services, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) explains Super Micro Computer’s stock price trajectory.\n\nSuper Micro Computer reported a topline growth of 144% in the fourth quarter. Analysts expected the AI server company’s margin weakness to recover by fiscal 2025, easing the competitive pricing environment.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Super Micro Computer through Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).\n\nPrice Action: SMCI shares traded lower by 2.77% at $606.50 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nPhoto via Company\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nSUPER MICRO COMPUTER (SMCI): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Super Micro Computer Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - An appeals court in Washington, D.C. revived the district's lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc on Thursday, saying it plausibly claimed the online retailer's pricing policies illegally stifle competition.\n\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that had dismissed the lawsuit, which accuses Amazon of harming competition through restrictions on its suppliers and third-party sellers on Amazon.com.\n\nAmazon is currently seeking dismissal of another case involving similar claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and more than a dozen states.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said the company disagrees with the appeals court ruling and looks forward to proving its policies benefit consumers.\n\n\"Just like any store owner who wouldn’t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don’t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced,\" he said.\n\nD.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb welcomed the court's ruling in a statement.\n\n\"We will continue fighting to stop Amazon’s unfair and unlawful practices that have raised prices for District consumers and stifled innovation and choice across online retail,\" he said.\n\nD.C. sued Amazon in May 2021 claiming Amazon effectively bans third party sellers from offering products for less elsewhere by refusing to highlight their listings if they do.\n\nThe lawsuit also claims Amazon has agreements with wholesalers that guarantee it a minimum profit. As a result, the complaint alleges, if Amazon lowers a price to compete with another online seller, the wholesaler must pay Amazon the difference between the price it sells at and the agreed minimum. These payments are a disincentive for wholesalers to lower prices to compete, the complaint said.\n\nThe D.C. appeals court said on Thursday the judge who dismissed the case in May 2023 set the bar too high, and the attorney general had a plausible claim the practices harmed competition in the online retail marketplace.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The Market Is Battering Some Stocks After Earnings, Time To Invest?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe U.S. companies have fared surprisingly well this year despite concerns about delayed rate cuts amid stickier-than-expected inflation rates and surmounting geopolitical tensions. Despite the volatile market backdrop, the top 500 companies in the U.S., in terms of market capitalization, have beat analyst estimates to deliver expectations.\n\nEarnings season is typically a time of celebration or reckoning for companies and investors alike. In the earnings season for the second quarter of 2024, 79% of S&P 500 companies that published their quarterly financials reported a positive EPS surprise, while 60% of the companies in the benchmark index issued a positive revenue surprise.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Find out how you compare to the average American couple’s retirement balance — will you make the $1,000,000 mark?\n\nA beat on earnings expectations often leads to a stock rally, while a miss can result in a sharp sell-off. However, investors have displayed muted enthusiasm for companies beating consensus estimates during the Q2 2024 earnings season.\n\nMixed Earnings Performance and Market Reaction\n\nAs of Aug. 16, 93% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their earnings for Q2 2024. Of these, 79% have posted earnings per share that exceeded analysts' expectations. This is slightly above the 5-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 74%.\n\nDespite the high percentage of companies beating estimates, the magnitude of these earnings surprises has been underwhelming. On average, earnings have surpassed estimates by just 3.5%, well below the 5-year average of 8.6% and the 10-year average of 6.8%.\n\nThe market's reaction to these earnings surprises has been telling. According to a report published by FactSet, S&P 500 companies that reported positive earnings surprises saw their stock prices rise by an average of just 0.8% in the two days before and after their earnings release. This is below the 5-year average of a 1.0% increase for companies reporting positive surprises.\n\nFor instance, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), a tech stalwart and Magnificent Seven stock, delivered a strong earnings beat, as its GAAP EPS amounted to $1.26 in the second quarter of 2024, higher than the consensus estimate of $1.03. Yet, despite this positive surprise, Amazon's stock price plummeted by 11.4% between July 30 and August 5. Over the past month, Amazon's shares have declined by nearly 2.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, companies that missed earnings expectations saw their shares decline faster than the five-year average. Stocks of companies that reported negative earnings surprises declined by an average of 3.8% in the two days before and after their earnings release, significantly worse than the 5-year average decline of 2.3%.\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F), for instance, saw its shares plummet by over 20% between July 22 and July 26 after reporting its second-quarter earnings results. The company's Q2 EPS came in at $0.47, falling short of the $0.64 Wall Street estimate.\n\nRead More:\n\nDiscover the compelling reasons behind the staggering $110.5 million price tag of this painting and explore the world of high-value art investments.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nCompanies Feeling the Pinch\n\nThe percentage of companies issuing negative EPS guidance for Q3 2024 is below average, at 55%, compared to the 5-year average of 59% and the 10-year average of 63%. Additionally, analysts' revisions to Q3 earnings estimates aligned with historical norms, decreasing by 1.8% during July, which matches the 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year averages.\n\nEquities Rally\n\nAs U.S. equities recover from the carry trade rout earlier this month, the S&P 500 index and tech-focused Nasdaq composite index logged less than 1% gains during the Aug. 19 trading session. This marks the first consecutive eight-day gains for major indexes, and it is the first time both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have witnessed such a rally so far in 2024.\n\n\"While we do remain generally bullish, we don't see a straight line up in the market,\" said Greg Marcus, Managing Director at UBS Private Wealth. \"The economy is slowing, and there will likely be a mix of conflicting economic data points over the coming months, which is set to continue this recessionary debate.\"\n\nInterestingly, the topic of elections has gained significant traction this earnings season. A staggering 116 S&P 500 companies discussed “elections” during their Q2 2024 earnings calls, a sharp rise from the 65 companies that did so in Q2 2020.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "It's hard to argue with results, and the Oracle of Omaha has an extensive track record of great investments. He doesn't necessarily hit on every one of his convictions, but it's a good idea for investors to pay attention to his logic.\n\nThe two stocks below offer a compelling combination of growth, cash flow, sustainable competitive advantages, and reasonable valuation. They should at least be on every investor's radar.\n\n1. Visa\n\nWarren Buffett loves to own companies that produce cash flow and have sustainable competitive advantages. Berkshire Hathaway's significant investment in Visa(NYSE: V) reflects those qualities.\n\nConsumers often associate Visa with banks because the brand features prominently on credit and debit cards, but it isn't a financial institution. Visa provides payment-processing services; it's a fintech business that provides the \"plumbing\" for transactions all over the globe. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.\n\nVisa holds the largest market share among its peers, so its financial results depend on competitive performance and overall economic activity. Payment volumes rise and fall with economic cycles, and there's not much that Visa can do to avoid that. However, the processing industry is projected to average double-digit annual growth over the next decade. If investors can manage the cyclicality, the long-term trends create a bullish foundation for continued growth.\n\nThe financial sector is being disrupted by blockchain and other fintech innovations. Disruption is a challenge for dominant incumbents like Visa, so investors need to be wary of the new forces shaping the market right now.\n\nFortunately, incumbents can also benefit from disruption if they embrace innovation and stay at the forefront of emerging trends. That's easier said than done, but Visa appears to be navigating those challenges so far. It has maintained a large market share, continued to expand, and raised its already impressive return on invested capital (ROIC) throughout recent years. These are all signs that new technologies aren't forcing Visa off its perch. V Return on Invested Capital Chart\n\nVisa's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 23.5 right now. That's an attractive valuation for a reliable cash-flow powerhouse that's delivering 10% revenue expansion and nearly 20% earnings growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is maturing, so it may have lost some of its appeal to growth investors who were enamored with unrelenting sales expansion in years past. However, the company is settling comfortably into a cash-flow generation role, which is exactly how it got on Buffett's shortlist.\n\nAmazon reported 10% revenue growth in its most recent quarter, which is respectable. Much of those gains are falling straight to the bottom line as the company carefully controls its operating expenses. It delivered 75% growth in operating profits and cash flow.\n\nWhile the e-commerce industry normalizes from pandemic-related distortions, Amazon continues adding to its dominant market share. Its scale and focus on logistics and technology create a fearsome economic moat, which is difficult for any competitor to match, even a retail powerhouse like Walmart.\n\nAmazon has supplemented its core e-commerce operations with a market-leading, cloud-infrastructure business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Making yourself an indispensable part of the modern technology sector is a shrewd move, even if it's a relatively low-margin business that competes with giants like Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nAmazon has also become a major player in content streaming. That's proven to be a challenging business model for other streaming platforms, but Amazon minimizes the challenges of acquiring and retaining subscribers thanks to Prime's reach. The media world changed drastically over the past 15 years, tossing many legacy powerhouses aside. Amazon swiftly stepped in to assume a leadership role in the new landscape.\n\nThis tech giant has successfully transformed into a profitable enterprise that's delivering impressive cash-flow growth. The company's substantial competitive advantages bode well for future cash flows. Its enormous scale should fuel key investments in AI and other emerging technologies in the years to come by funding acquisitions and internal research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nWith a forward P/E ratio above 35, Amazon's valuation is a bit more expensive than Visa's. However, the price is acceptable for long-term holders who want exposure to a high-quality company with clear growth prospects.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big data stocks.\n\nThe global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\n\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today’s competitive landscape.\n\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market’s growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\n\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\n\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

It dominates e-commerce through Prime, driving increased sales and faster shipping. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also a major player in digital advertising, exceeding a $50 billion annual run rate with a 20% growth. The company has generated $53 billion in free cash flow over the past year and remains attractive at its current share price due to strong cash flow yields.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best big data stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Nasdaq Sell-Off: 2 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite has increased by 127% over the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500's 95% rise in that period. This difference illustrates the power of tech, with the Nasdaq home to many of the world's leading tech giants. Companies like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are collectively worth more than $13 trillion, or 60% of the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe index has a long growth history, driven by the innovations of its many tech giants. As a result, a recent dip in the market has made now a compelling time to bulk up your portfolio with some of the most reliable growth stocks.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Nasdaq has tumbled 5%. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. had added 114,000 jobs in July. The figure illustrated a significant slowdown from the 179,000 jobs added in June, prompting fears of a recession and a sell-off in the stock market that hit tech companies particularly hard.\n\nHowever, tech remains one of the best long-term growth markets, known for offering patient investors consistent gains. As a result, a sell-off is an exciting time to add some new names to your list of holdings at an attractive value.\n\nSo, here are two unstoppable growth stocks to buy right now after a Nasdaq sell-off.\n\n1. ASML Holding NV\n\nASML Holding NV's (NASDAQ: ASML) share price has dipped 14% in the last month. Strained relations between the U.S. and China have led to increasingly stringent regulations on chip exports. As a leader in chipmaking equipment, geopolitical concerns have caused investors to pull back from ASML's stock.\n\nHowever, the Dutch company's crucial role in tech and growth catalysts from budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) indicate ASML remains a solid long-term investment.\n\nASML is the kingpin of lithography, accounting for more than 80% of the market. The company has carved out a lucrative role in tech, producing lithography systems for optically etching circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. ASML's technology is critical to chip production, and some of its biggest clients include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung, and Intel.\n\nThe company's success over the years has seen its share price rise nearly 900% over the last decade, while revenue and operating income climbed 284% and 518%. ASML has proven to be a valuable growth stock over the years but is likely not yet done.\n\nASML hasn't experienced massive growth in 2024, with revenue down 10% year over year in the second quarter. However, the company has said, \"We see 2024 as a transition year,\" as clients like TSM and Intel temporarily pause chip fab expansions amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a surplus in chip inventory. However, ASML expects growth to accelerate in 2025 as shipments for its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems rise alongside increased demand for smaller and denser chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nASML's stock isn't a huge bargain, trading at 44 times its forward earnings. However, that figure is below its year-to-date average for the metric during a period that saw its shares rise 21%. Alongside an indispensable role in the chip market, ASML remains a compelling buy after a sell-off.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nUnstoppable is an excellent word to describe Amazon's growth in recent years. The company's stock is up 105% since 2019. Meanwhile, revenue and operating income have soared 112% and 365%. Dominant positions in e-commerce and cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) have built the tech giant into a cash cow, with free cash flow increasing more than 1,000% to $48 billion in the last three years.\n\nAmazon's success is primarily owed to consistent reinvestment in its business. Over the last decade, the company has gone on a spending spree, expanding its reach in retail, opening AWS data centers in multiple regions at home and abroad, and introducing ads on its streaming service Prime Video. Recent moves have paid off, diversifying its revenue streams and delivering consistent financial growth.\n\nThe company posted its Q2 2024 earnings earlier this month, which illustrated the strength of its increasingly diverse business. Revenue rose 10% year over year, slightly missing expectations. However, the real win came in operating income, which more than doubled from the previous year to just under $15 billion.\n\nQ2 brought solid gains from AWS as the company benefited from recent investments in AI. The segment saw revenue increase by 19% year over year, as operating income climbed 74%. AWS earned less revenue than Amazon's two retail segments yet was responsible for 64% of the company's total operating income for the quarter.\n\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory. Although its stock is down 8% since mid-July, its price-to-sales ratio has dropped to an attractive 3. As a result, this growth stock is just too good to ignore right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Short Sellers Are Bullish On This Advertising Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other advertising stocks.\n\nWhen compared to the copy driven model of the late 1900s as popularized by shows such as Mad Men, the advertising era of 2024 is completely different. Today, advertisers have at their disposal the data of billions of people which they can characterize according to preference and target their ads to. This growth in digital advertising has been driven by the rise of video streaming platforms and digital publications, which continue to gain market share over paper newspapers.\n\nNowhere else is the impact of digital advertising in today's era clear as through the value of the world's largest search engine company. A mega cap stock, this firm has a market value of a whopping $2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market value. Yet, in another case of 2024 being a historic year of shifts for the technology industry as evidenced by technologies such as artificial intelligence, this firm is also facing the heat from the US government which might end up changing the very fabric of the industry.\n\nThe search engine giant, which earned $187 billion in trailing twelve month revenue from search and advertising, traces its roots back to the late 1990s when its founders created an algorithm called PageRank. This software determined which webpages were authoritative based on the amount and quality of backlinks they got, and as the engine grew, so did the firm's dominance in the global advertising industry as it processes more than 22 billion searches per day. However, this gravy train might be ending as a Washington judge ruled in August that its $26 billion in payments to other firms to make the platform the default option on their devices was an anti competitive behavior that locked others out in the industry.\n\nFollowing the ruling, there are rumors that the Justice Department might be considering breaking the company up by making it divest its mobile software and web browsing business divisions. However, any such decision will require court approval which will force the firm to comply. And while a court victory is great for news headlines, the US government has rarely broken up large companies in the modern era. The last such case was in 1982 through the breakup of the Bell System, and even if the browser and OS were made separate businesses, they are unlikely to survive on their own since both are provided to users for free.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot to mention, the long drawn nature of anti-trust action could take years, and end up being enforced when the industry is vastly different from what it is now. This is because artificial intelligence is gnawing at the heels of the industry, with products such as OpenAI's SearchGPT already in early stage releases. Speaking of AI, it's also making its mark on the advertising industry. Just as advertisers are able to rely on millions of users' data through search and social media platforms, AI helps them navigate through this data in novel and new ways.\n\nAs per McKinsey, marketing and sales could see a $931 billion productivity boost from AI through new features such as personalized campaigns and improved data use. These use cases have already become apparent, with the largest social media company in the world regularly sharing updates about how it is using AI to make advertisers' jobs easier on its platform. Two tools that it offers are the Advantage+ and Advantage+ Shopping platform which enables advertisers and sellers to automate their campaign operations and determine the best advertisements to run. The platforms also appear to be driving results, with the firm quoting a study that is \"demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns\" with revenue for the firm through the two AI platforms doubling annually during Q1 2024.\n\nSpeaking of revenue, the advertising industry's spending, which determines the fate of publishers is also determined by the state of the economy, consumer confidence, and advertisers' outlook. One such firm with brands in more than 100 companies shared during its Q2 2024 earnings call that while the advertising market is not at its best right now, it does appear to be recovering. This recovery is taking place in areas such as food and technology which joins strong performance in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beauty care. Another publisher, which is one of the most well known digital media and lifestyle platforms in the world that relies on programmatic advertising (data driven user targeting through ads), saw its programmatic revenue grow by 3% annually during Q2 even as broader advertising revenue dropped by 19% annually.\n\nWith these details in mind let's take a look at which advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. For stocks that are driving advertising technology, you should check out 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers, we listed the NASDAQ and NYSE listings of an advertising ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage. An added 23 stocks after an internet search were also analyzed, but all these had market caps below $300 million so they were excluded.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nShort Interest as % of  Shares Outstanding: 0.68%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the biggest eCommerce companies in the world, which also makes it a key player in the advertising industry. This is because Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s eCommerce site which attracted 3.25 billion users in June according to SemRush, creates a golden goose of users for large and small businesses to target. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) helps its sellers to run marketing campaigns through the Amazon Ads platform. Some features under this include cost per click (CPC) ads for sponsored brands, products, and displays. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also operates in the SaaS advertising industry through its AWS business which allows customers to run advanced marketing analytics and manage customer experiences. As a whole, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s hypothesis depends on its ability to optimize its fulfillment networks, increase same day deliveries, leverage AI in its business and in AWS product offerings, and the broader economic health.\n\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): It’s ‘Making A Comeback’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500’s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I’m telling you, it’s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\n\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance—with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%—the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn’t as favorable. We’re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\n\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\n\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\n\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\n\nJim Cramer noted that, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), there was disappointment with recent performance, with concerns about consumer spending slowing down. However, Morgan Stanley recently reported optimism for same-day consumable sales, which are becoming increasingly popular.\n\n\"Similar to Amazon, people were disappointed with the last quarter, with a lot of talk about consumers tapping out. Today, Morgan Stanley came out and said there's hope for same-day consumable sales, which are becoming habit-forming. Amazon's making a comeback—up 18 points from where it fell after the setback.\"\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to lead in global e-commerce with its wide range of products, efficient logistics, and focus on customer satisfaction. Its cloud computing arm, AWS, drives significant growth due to high demand for cloud services and strong profit margins. Amazon Prime’s growing subscriber base benefits from perks like free shipping, streaming services, and exclusive deals.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s substantial investment in technology, including artificial intelligence and automation, boosts efficiency and supports innovation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s diverse revenue sources—advertising, subscription services, and physical retail stores like Whole Foods—help manage risks and provide multiple growth opportunities. With solid financial results, including strong revenue growth, high-profit margins from AWS, and healthy cash flow, Amazon.com, Inc.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): ‘I Like The Saga So Much; It Makes Me Happy.’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500’s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I’m telling you, it’s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\n\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance—with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%—the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn’t as favorable. We’re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\n\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\n\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\n\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 216\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s IPO, Jim Cramer reflected on the company's remarkable journey. Cramer had estimated Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s value at around $300 on its first day, a figure so high that it prompted questions from his lawyer. In hindsight, he admitted that $500 would have been a more accurate estimate, though he was being conservative.\n\n\"On this the 20th anniversary of the IPO, I want you to consider the saga of Google. I like the saga so much; it makes me happy. When it went public, it used a Dutch auction system which favored buyers over sellers. You got a driven price if you managed to snag a piece of it. I remember mentioning on air that I thought Google was worth about $300 that day, a price so high that our lawyer called me to ask how I came up with that number. I said I would have used $500 but was being conservative.\"\n\nSince its IPO, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has continually reinvented itself, growing its cloud business significantly under Thomas Kurian, who took over in 2019. Cramer praised Kurian’s achievements, noting that Google Cloud is now on a $42 billion run rate. He also highlighted recent executive changes, including the appointment of a new CFO, which he views positively. Cramer noted that while Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a tremendous performer—delivering a 7,736% return since its IPO—investors often struggle with short-term market fluctuations.\n\nHe compared this situation to recent market movements, such as\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strong performance despite broader market concerns. Cramer emphasized that individual stocks, rather than indices like the S&P 500, are the real drivers of wealth creation. He also advised maintaining positions in top-performing companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), despite short-term market volatility.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Lam Research and Elevance. Alphabet shares rose by 21% during the quarter, making it the largest contributor to our performance. The company reported excellent Q1 earnings, highlighting accelerating revenue growth, strong profitability and effective capital allocation. Alphabet’s core search business is growing at a mid-teens rate—the fastest growth rate in nearly two years. Importantly, its non-search businesses have reached significant scale, with its cloud and YouTube businesses expected to reach a combined run-rate of $100 billion by the end of 2024\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also displayed meaningful progress in its AI initiatives, and we believe it is well positioned to be a leader in this field. The capital allocation is solid. It is returning all the free cash flow to shareholders and announced that it will start paying a dividend. Alphabet’s shares are trading at just over 20X next year’s earnings, which is a very reasonable valuation for a business with such high-quality characteristics and growth potential.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top bullish stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. In December 2023, PKT Logistics Group became the first Malaysian signatory to The Climate Pledge.\n\nIn July 2024, Amazon announced it met its goal to match all of the electricity consumed across Amazon’s global operations—including its data centers, corporate buildings, grocery stores and fulfillment centers—with 100% renewable energy in 2023, seven years ahead of its original 2030 commitment. To get there, Amazon became the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world since 2020, and the solar and wind farms enabled by Amazon stimulated billions of dollars in estimated economic investment globally from 2014 through 2022. Additionally, AWS is committed to being water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nAWS is constantly working on ways to increase the energy efficiency of its data centers—optimizing data center design, investing in purpose-built chips, and innovating with new cooling technologies. A new report by Accenture, commissioned by AWS, estimates AWS’s infrastructure is up to 4.1 times more efficient than on-premises, and when workloads are optimized on AWS, the associated carbon footprint can be reduced by up to 99%. With the new AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region, customers will also benefit from AWS’s sustainability efforts across its infrastructure.

        "title": "Meet the $465 million startup UPS acquired that helps solve the ‘free returns’ nightmare that Amazon fueled",
        "content": "When UPS posted its worst-ever day on the stock market after a disappointing earnings report in July, there was one “bright spot,” according to company executives. And it had very little to do with traditional shipping.\n\nInstead, it was UPS’s package returns business, which has gotten a boost from a young company called Happy Returns that has developed a clever system for consumers and retailers to deal with returns of online purchases. While Amazon, Walmart, and express delivery companies continue to set customer expectations high when it comes to fast delivery speeds, the amount of merchandise bought online that ends up being returned continues to plague retailers and product brands alike.\n\nOn average, customers return more than one out of every six items purchased online, according to the National Retail Federation. But the issue is far worse in some categories such as apparel and fashion, with return rates that can run as high as 30% to 60% depending on the specific type of clothing. Those numbers can prove devastating to a company’s income statement. The challenge has been exacerbated by customer expectations that returns should be free.\n\nEnter Happy Returns, which has been trying to help bring down return costs for retail brands—especially those who don’t have any, or many, physical stores of their own—since it was founded in 2015. Think digital-native brands like Allbirds, Gymshark, Faherty, and Figs.\n\nThe service also provides online shoppers a less expensive, and sometimes easier, way to return goods that are purchased online but not from a giant retailer like Amazon that can subsidize free returns, or other mass retailers that can accept returns at a large chain of stores.\n\nAnd the model is starting to pay dividends for UPS, which bought the nine-year-old company from PayPal in the fall for $465 million. (PayPal had acquired the venture-backed startup in 2021 for $275 million, before selling off the asset last year following a CEO change.) On its most recent earnings call, executives called out Happy Returns as a main contributor to the 3% year-over-year growth of UPS’s returns business.\n\nThe Happy Returns model facilitates a model known as \"buy online, return in store,\" or BORIS in industry lingo. The company sets up “returns bars” inside physical retail stores like Ulta Beauty that are willing to accept packages from other retailers and brands—predominantly ones that have either no stores of their own or very few. Online retailers or brands pay Happy Returns a monthly fee so their customers can return orders to any Happy Returns location nationwide, whether inside another brick-and-mortar retail partner store or one of around 5,000 UPS Store locations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe online fast-fashion giant Shein, for example, works with Happy Returns so that its customers can return orders at one of the approximately 300 Forever 21 stores in the U.S. When a Shein customer makes such a return, Forever 21 offers a discount if the Shein customer purchases something from the store during the same visit.\n\nThe end customer sees the in-person Happy Returns option on the retailer’s website when they navigate to the returns page, and then can return just the product itself with a QR code and no shipping box necessary. The refund is often processed immediately. And the online brand responsible for the return saves money by having a large box of returns shipped back to them from the returns location, rather than individual ones from each customer.\n\nAnh Vu-Lieberman has observed this firsthand. She’s an executive at Nogin, a company that manages the e-commerce operations for clothing brands like Hurley, Scotch & Soda, and Bebe. Over the last year, eight of Nogin’s brands have started offering a Happy Returns option to their customers. Across these brands, Nogin has recorded around $1 million in savings, according to Vu-Lieberman. About half of those savings have come from decreased customer service contacts related to questions surrounding the status of a refund, since Happy Returns typically initiates a refund at the time of product drop-off. The other half has come largely from convincing customers that choose the Happy Returns dropoff option to opt for a merchandise exchange instead of a refund. Some brands offer added incentives to nudge customers toward an exchange.\n\nThus far, more than eight out of 10 shoppers across Nogin brands have selected the Happy Returns option—versus a mail-in choice—for bringing back merchandise they’ve decided they no longer want or need. Typically, Nogin brands will charge fees for returns whether shipped by the customer or returned to a Happy Returns counter, though the former option is cheaper for customers. While Happy Returns advises its business customers to offer the in-store return option for free, Nogin has eschewed that approach and says it is still reaping some benefits.\n\nThese are the realities for companies not named Amazon.\n\n“There is no such thing as truly free returns,” she said.\n\nRead more by Jason Del Rey:\n\nAmazon is testing product search results that don’t show customer review ‘star’ ratings\n\nThe problem with the war against Temu and Shein\n\nAmazon’s hugely beneficial product-safety loophole just evaporated\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Jeff Bezos may be considering a bid for the fourth most valuable team in the NBA.\r\n\r\nRumors, which gained traction on Monday, suggest that the Amazon founder and the world’s second-richest person might plot a $6 billion purchase of the Boston Celtics.\n\nBill Simmons, the sports media personality and Boston native, credited the speculation on his podcast. \"In the last few days, there’s been some legitimate buzz about Jeff Bezos buying the Celtics and I think it’s real,\" Simmons said. \"I think he's going to be one of the suitors.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before as the offer closes today reaching its 800 pre-orders.\n\nThe Celtics, who won the 2024 NBA finals, were unexpectedly put up for sale by Boston Basketball Partners LLC – the group led by majority owner Wyc Grousbeck – just weeks after securing the championship. According to Forbes, the team’s value soared to an estimated $4.7 billion, making it the fourth most valuable franchise in the NBA.\r\n\r\nA $6 billion deal would represent a 24.29% premium over its current value.\n\nTrending:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nAccording to Forbes, Bezos, with a net worth of $195.3 billion, is one of the few individuals with enough money to make the purchase. Adding to the speculation is his previous interest in sports team ownership, as he was linked to a bid for the NFL’s Washington Commanders before being outbid by Josh Harris, according to NBC Sports.\n\nShould Bezos compete for the purchase of the Celtics, the potential sale would be complicated. Grousbeck outlined a two-part sale structure to CNBC last month, with 51% of the team to be sold immediately and the remaining 49% to change hands in 2028.\n\nTrending:This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nFor Bezos, acquiring the Celtics could be more than just a trophy asset. Amazon Prime is set to begin broadcasting NBA games in 2025, potentially creating synergies between team ownership and the tech giant’s media ambitions.\n\nHowever, any new owner of the Celtics will face immediate financial challenges. According to Athlon Sports, the team is poised to incur luxury tax penalties as soon as 2025 because of its efforts to keep its winning roster intact.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending:This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\n\nBezos’s purchase of the Celtics would add to a broader trend of business magnates entering the sports ownership arena. He would join the likes of Mark Cuban, who owns 27% of the Dallas Mavericks; Steve Ballmer, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers; David Tepper, who owns the Carolina Panthers; Dan Gilbert, who owns the Cleveland Cavaliers; and others who own storied franchises across the NFL and NBA.\r\n\r\nWhile the prospect of the Amazon founder taking the team’s reins is still speculative, Chris Mannix, a senior writer at Sports Illustrated, said on X (formerly Twitter) that a Bezos-Celtics bid would \"undoubtedly\" be welcome.\r\n\r\nSo, the idea of the Amazon founder sitting courtside, watching his team face off against Cuban's Mavericks (as we saw during the 2024 NBA Finals), no longer seems far-fetched.\n\nRead Next:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

        "content": "Slash prices on milk, meat, and bread in this inflation-battered economy, and the consumer is going to notice while wandering the supermarket aisles.\n\nThat's especially the case for the deal-seeking Target (TGT) shopper.\n\nThe discount retailer shredded Wall Street profit forecasts by $0.39 on Wednesday on the back of renewed traffic to stores. Traffic increased by 3%, with all six departments at Target contributing to the improvement.\n\nAs Target CEO Brian Cornell tells it, the retailer's comeback quarter reflects a steady dose of price cuts this summer on 5,000 daily essentials — items where Target was losing market share to rival Walmart (WMT) for several quarters in a row.\n\n\"We feel great about the reaction that we're seeing from the consumer based on the 5,000 items where we've seen price reductions,\" Cornell told Yahoo Finance on a call with reporters. \"It certainly contributed to traffic growth during the quarter — we expect that to continue over the balance of the year.\"\n\nCornell declined to say if more price cuts were coming.\n\nTarget stayed cautious with its full-year sales guidance as it enters the dueling peak seasons of back to school and the holidays. But it did lift its full-year profit forecast amid the second quarter beat and improved traffic trends.\n\n\"Walmart's second quarter earnings highlighted that value and convenience are resonating with consumers. We believe Target's heightened focus on value positions it well for [market] share gains going forward including improving price gaps and several new owned brand launches focused on value and entry level price points,\" Bank of America analyst Robbie Ohmes said in a client note.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet sales: +2.7% year over year to $25.5 billion, vs. estimates for $24.88 billion Gross profit margin: 28.9% vs. 27% a year ago, vs. estimates for 28% Diluted EPS: +43% year over year to $2.57, vs. estimates for $2.18 (guidance: $1.95 to $2.35) Comparable sales: +2% year over year (last year it fell 5.4%; Walmart US reported a 4.2% gain in the second quarter of 2024) vs -1.07% estimate\n\nDigital comparable sales: 1.4% Store comparable sales: -4.8%\n\nWhat else caught our attention\n\nInventory was relatively unchanged from the prior year. The company restarted stock buybacks, purchasing $155 million in the quarter. $9.5 billion remains available to repurchase under a prior authorization. The number of transactions rose 3% in the quarter, while the average transaction amount dropped 0.9%. Target ended the quarter with almost $3.5 billion in cash. Third quarter earnings per share are projected to be $2.20 to $2.40, vs. estimates for $2.24.\n\nComparable sales for the quarter are projected to be unchanged to up 2%. Full-year earnings per share are projected to be $9 to $9.70 (previous: $8.60 to $9.60), vs. estimates for $9.22.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "By Aditya Kalra and Shivangi Acharya\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's commerce minister accused Amazon and other e-commerce companies of predatory pricing practices and said the sector's rapid rise should not disrupt millions of brick-and-mortar stores operating in the country.\n\nAmazon and Walmart's Flipkart have reshaped India's retail landscape in recent years, with both companies investing billions of dollars to expand and get consumers to their platforms which offer lucrative discounts.\n\nIndian regulations prohibit Amazon and Flipkart from stocking goods and selling directly to consumers, and they can only operate a marketplace for other sellers to offer products. However, small retailers have often alleged that the regulations are bypassed using complicated business structures.\n\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday signalled out Amazon's business practices and said the company's investments in India have often been used to cover its business losses.\n\nGoyal, however, did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\n\"When Amazon says we are going to invest a billion dollars in India and we all celebrate, we forget the underlying story that the billion dollars is not coming in for any great service,\" Goyal said at an event in New Delhi, where he did not name any other company.\n\nDo the losses \"not smell of predatory pricing to any of you ... what was that loss for, they are not allowed to sell to consumers (directly),\" he added.\n\nAmazon and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAmazon in June last year said it will increase its India investments to $26 billion by 2030, including for its cloud business. It is also targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\n\nGoyal has in the past attacked U.S. e-commerce giants publicly. In 2021, he said companies were using their scale and access to large pools of low-cost capital \"to the detriment of mom-and-pop stores\" and that they \"very blatantly flouted\" laws.\n\nA Reuters special report in 2021 found Amazon's internal documents showed the U.S. e-commerce company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its Indian platform, gave them discounted fees and used them to bypass foreign investment laws.\n\nAmazon had then said that it is confident of local law compliance and it \"does not give preferential treatment to any seller\".\n\nSubsequently, though, it was announced that two of Amazon's big sellers facing such allegations will stop selling products on its website.\n\n\"They create entities ... when they get caught they start closing down those entities,\" Goyal said on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon and Flipkart are also facing an antitrust investigation in India but deny any wrongdoing.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Shivangi Acharya; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "content": "In its latest “Hedge Fund Trend Monitor” report published Tuesday, Goldman Sachs highlights how timely rotations by hedge funds have helped them successfully navigate recent bouts of market volatility.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, hedge funds made significant positioning adjustments, particularly in the \"Magnificent\" mega-cap stocks, trimming their exposure even as these stocks continued to outperform. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were exceptions, with hedge funds increasing their stakes in these companies.\n\nThese moves, according to Goldman Sachs, lowered the Hedge Fund Crowding Index and helped funds mitigate the impact of the subsequent volatility that arose from a rotation away from mega-caps, which later evolved into a sharp cyclical-led selloff in early August.\n\nThe bank reveals that US equity long/short hedge funds have returned 9% year-to-date, outperforming broader market indices. The Hedge Fund VIP list, which tracks the most popular long positions, has delivered a 19% return, despite a 10% market selloff in July. This list includes stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which remain central to hedge fund portfolios.\n\n“Today, with the S&P 500 close to its high, hedge fund net and gross exposures register above 5-year averages but below levels carried before the selloff,” Goldman notes.\n\nIn another timely shift in the second quarter, hedge funds halted a rotation toward cyclicals that had begun in mid-2022.\n\nSpecifically, funds have moved their overweight position to Health Care, now the best-performing sector during the recent downturn relative to the Russell 3000. At the same time, they increased exposure to Industrials and Financials while reducing holdings in Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology.\n\nAccording to the note, this was the first time hedge funds lifted Financials to overweight since 2010.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTimely rotations help hedge funds navigate summer volatility: Goldman Sachs\n\nAlcon shares drop on earnings miss\n\nRussia's Rostec chief suggests protective measures on assembled car imports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\n\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\n\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\n\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% — the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. As it prepares to integrate AI into Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the biggest cloud computing operations in the world, the tech firm has continued to invest in other AI ventures, most notably the $4 billion investment in California-based startup Anthropic earlier this year. The latter is a rival of OpenAI of ChatGPT fame. Under the terms of the agreement, the startup will use AWS as the primary cloud provider as it uses Amazon chips to build, train, and deploy generative AI models. Authorities in the United Kingdom are reviewing this deal to determine if it violates business competition rules.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a Wall Street darling for many years. The past few weeks are no exception. Citigroup recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $245, noting that the firm delivered a strong second quarter as AWS revenue growth was accelerating, faster shipping times were improving conversion rates, and overall cost-to-serve costs were declining. The advisory further added that as the company incorporated AI across services, it was on track to deliver continued growth and margin expansion such that the third quarter operating income guide could prove conservative.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Forget Amazon: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "If you've been investing long enough, you've almost certainly considered a stake in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). It's one of Wall Street's favorite recommendations, after all. And to be fair, Amazon stock has been a solid performer and is still a respectable pick.\n\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, however, Amazon isn't quite the opportunity it was in its early days. Its massive size makes it difficult to continue growing at a meaningful pace. E-commerce competitors are finally stepping up their games, too. And shares are arguably near their full potential valuation. It might be time to put other names ahead of Amazon on your watch list.\n\nHere are three better options to think about buying now.\n\nDraftKings\n\nIt's been a tough few months for shareholders of sports betting technology company DraftKings(NASDAQ: DKNG). Mostly in response to revenue shortfalls and a proposed surcharge on its customers' wagering, the stock is down more than 30% from March's high, and still within sight of the multiweek low hit earlier this month. Investors are simply responding to headlines.\n\nBut these worries obscure the fact that DraftKings is still growing in a big way, and continuing to make progress toward sustained profitability.\n\nTake its second-quarter numbers as an example. While its top line of just over $1.1 billion fell slightly short of estimates of a little more than $1.11 billion, sales were still up 26% year over year. Adjusted per-share earnings of $0.22 not only topped expectations for a loss of $0.01, but nearly doubled the Q2 year-earlier comparison of $0.14. The second quarter's revenue and earnings also extended long-established trends that are expected to persist well into the future.\n\nAnd these lofty expectations are hardly out of line. Although the federal ban on sports betting was lifted in 2018, states have staggered their legalization of it. As of the latest look only about two-thirds of U.S. states now permit sports betting in any form. But many of the others are at least considering passing legislation that would make it legal, opening the door to DraftKings' presence in that market. Market research outfit Technavio believes the worldwide sports betting market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 12% through 2030, largely led by the U.S.\n\nFueling at least some of this expansion is the way the business grows. A paying customer base swells for a long time once DraftKings establishes its presence in a particular market, as people learn more about its offerings and finally respond to marketing efforts. As the graphic below shows, betting handles are still growing even in the fourth year DraftKings is operating in any given state. This ongoing progress is likely to show similar growth in the years beyond the fourth one, too, once DraftKings has that data to offer.\n\nStory continues Image source: DraftKings' November 2023 investor day presentation.\n\nTranslation: There's room and reason to expect continued growth here. So why isn't the stock reflecting any of this? Because sometimes stocks just temporarily stumble. For great companies like DraftKings though, these short-term stumbles are long-term buying opportunities.\n\nShopify\n\nMuch like DraftKings, Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) stock has been a tough name to stick with of late. Shares are down nearly 20% from their February peak despite a solid earnings-prompted bounce this month. Its recent profit guidance has been less than the market was hoping for. Also like DraftKings though, it's arguable that the market is only been looking for bad news from this name, ignoring the bigger bullish picture.\n\nShopify helps companies build and manage an e-commerce presence. Millions of small (and not-so-small) businesses rely on this company's tech to sell their goods and services. In many ways it could be considered the anti-Amazon in that it empowers a merchant with an option other than a massive online shopping mall that pits these sellers against one another.\n\nSure, the e-commerce market may be crowded and mature. That doesn't mean there's not lots of opportunity here, however. The Census Bureau reports that only about 16% of the United States' retail sales are done online. Although some of the other 84% can never be done online, a big chunk of that business is up for grabs to the e-commerce industry.\n\nMordor Intelligence believes the United States' e-commerce market is set to grow by an average of 14.7% per year through 2029. A similar dynamic applies overseas, where this company is starting to grow its presence.\n\nAnd forecasts jibe with this industrywide outlook. Shopify's 2024 top line is expected to improve on last year's revenue by over 23%, with the next several years likely to mirror that pace. Earnings are apt to keep growing at an even faster clip.\n\nYes, the company has got a profit margin challenge right now that probably will persist for at least a few more quarters. It's not a fatal problem, though. There's simply too much in direct-to-consumer shopping to hold Shopify back.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nFinally, add Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to your list of unstoppable stocks to buy instead of Amazon. You, of course, know the company. Microsoft has been at the heart of the personal computer business since its rapid proliferation in the '90s although it's become so much more in the meantime. Cloud computing, business services, artificial intelligence, and even video gaming are all in its wheelhouse now.\n\nDiversification isn't the crux of the reason you might want to own a piece of this software giant, however. Rather, it's the way the business increasingly works.\n\nFewer and fewer people are outright buying software anymore. They're renting cloud-based versions of their productivity platforms like Word or Excel, translating into predictable and recurring high-margin revenue for the provider. The company's cloud computing offerings are available via a similar arrangement. This model allows Microsoft to focus on attracting new paying customers.\n\nAnd it's doing this very, very well. Last quarter's revenue of $64.7 billion was up 16% year over year, extending long-standing growth trends that are expected to continue into the distant future. Ditto for earnings. The world's simply too dependent on this company -- and its popular Windows operating system in particular -- to truly consider alternative platforms.\n\nThis stock's persistent gains could be intimidating to would-be buyers. Don't sweat it so much that you end up unwilling to make a purchase though. The forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of just over 31 is actually relatively cheap given a revenue growth pace that's persistently in the mid-teens. Analysts' current consensus price target of nearly $500 is also 19% above the stock's present price.\n\nThis might help: Of the 60 analysts following Microsoft stock, 49 of them rate it not just a buy, but a strong buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DraftKings wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- More than any of the megacap technology stocks, Amazon.com Inc.’s big spending ways are coming at the expense of profits, and its shares are being punished as a result.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival ‘Train Lovers’ Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid Part of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks Climate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\n\nAmazon’s stock performance has lagged its megacap peers since its earnings report at the beginning of August, when the e-commerce giant signaled to investors that it would be prioritizing spending on artificial intelligence computing. The move is a shift back into investment mode after a period of cost cutting that led to a surge in profits and helped fuel a rally that’s seen the shares more than double from a late 2022 low.\n\n“Investors are worried that the increase in capital spending will impact cash flows,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. Amazon shares tend to outperform when it’s focused on improving profitability, compared with when it’s boosting investments, Abate said.\n\nThe switch back to spending mode “has investors recognizing that the significant period of outperformance for the stock may be at least on pause if not over for a period of time,” Abate added. Amazon shares remain more than 3% below where they traded prior to the results, compared with a gain of about 4% for the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index over that span. Shares of Amazon were slightly lower in early trading Tuesday.\n\nThe worry that increased spending will crimp profitability is top-of-mind for investors, given that margin expansion was among key trends that lifted Amazon shares during a run of more than 30% to a peak in early July. Daniel Kurnos at Benchmark sees that positive momentum now potentially at risk.\n\n“A confluence of particular timing of events could conspire to put incremental downward pressure on margins for the next couple of quarters,” according to Kurnos. This could also put a “sharper focus back on the top line at a time when the macro appears to be unstable at best,” he wrote in an Aug. 2 note.\n\nThe “macro” affects Amazon differently to its megacap tech peers because of the company’s mix of offerings. The combination of retail, video streaming and film and television businesses sets it apart and also brings varying exposure to developments in the broader economy. While the AWS cloud unit remains a bright spot, a weaker US consumer could drag on retail.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It seems like investors are waiting on the sidelines to get more information on the consumer,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC. “That’s probably why it’s lagged relative to some of the other peers.”\n\nInvestors may also be growing weary of Amazon’s rising cash pile and history of not returning it to shareholders. The company is one of the only megacap technology firms that doesn’t have a dividend. It has also been much less generous than its big tech cohort when it comes to buybacks.\n\nWhile the rest of its peers have approved tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in repurchases, Amazon’s $10 billion buyback program, which it approved in 2022, was less than half complete at the end of June. The company didn’t complete any share repurchases in the last quarter.\n\nPressure to compete for investor capital may be even higher for Amazon now that Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have all added dividends on top of their buybacks, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak wrote in an Aug. 18 note.\n\nThat leaves Amazon alongside only Tesla Inc. among tech megacaps without “an impactful capital return policy,” Nowak wrote. “If nothing changes by year end ‘25 we estimate AMZN’s net cash balance will make up ~8% of its total market cap.” That would rank it second-highest among the top-25 S&P 500 companies by market value, he added. “In our view a sustained capital return policy would likely lead to a higher multiple on AMZN’s cash flow.”\n\nStill, there are signs investors are stepping back into beaten-down technology shares, buying the dip in Amazon as well as Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. Amazon’s stock is up about 11% from the most recent trough on Aug. 5.\n\nThe latest downturn in its shares took Amazon’s valuation to about 28 times forward earnings, a discount to most of the so-called Magnificent Seven — only Alphabet has a lower multiple. It’s also at only a slight premium to the Nasdaq 100 index, which trades at about 26 times future earnings.\n\n“People have muscle memory and the winning trade for most people has been to use any dip in the Magnificent Seven as a buying opportunity,” said Abate. “And, you know, until that doesn’t work anymore, people are gonna continue to do it.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nEdgar Bronfman Jr. has formally submitted a $4.3 billion bid to take control of Paramount Global and quash an existing offer from Skydance Media, according to a person familiar with the proposal. Apple Inc. will make the most expensive iPhone Pro and Pro Max models in India for the first time this year, a milestone for the US company and the Asian country’s manufacturing sector. A Chinese-made game backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. has become the fourth most popular title ever on Steam within hours of its launch, an unusually rapid ascent that may help seal its place in industry lore. Battery maker Northvolt AB told employees at a subsidiary in San Francisco to reapply for jobs within the group after deciding to move its R&D efforts from California to Sweden.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nKingsoft Cloud Postmarket\n\nKeysight\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein, Subrat Patnaik and Rheaa Rao.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport Where All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes Inside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem Sports Betting Is Legal, and Sportswriting Might Never Recover\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - TV viewership in the United States rose 3.5% in July from a year earlier, largely driven by the summer Olympics in Paris, according to research firm Nielsen's latest The Gauge report.\n\nStreaming platforms amassed 41.4% of TV viewership for the month and accounted for the largest share among all TV viewing formats, including traditional broadcast and cable networks.\n\nThe Gauge report unveils TV viewing trends of the U.S. audience across platforms and distributors.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nMedia companies including Netflix, Amazon.com and Walt Disney are increasingly investing in sports content and bidding wars for rights to broadcast major sporting events to attract younger viewers.\n\nWhile the beginning of the Paris Olympics was a major driving factor for the uptick in TV viewership in July, the U.S. presidential election campaign also contributed.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nAll the spotlight was on Comcast's streaming platform Peacock in July as it saw a 33% spike in its monthly usage, mainly boosted by the Olympics and shows such as 'Love Island USA'.\n\nOther streamers that performed well include Amazon.com's Amazon Prime Video and Roku Channel.\n\nYouTube, owned by Alphabet's Google, became the first streaming platform ever to exceed 10% of total TV usage in July, compared with 9.9% in June.\n\nAmong the streaming programs, 'House of Dragons' on Max topped with 4.7 billion viewing minutes. 'Bluey' on Walt Disney-owned Disney+ came in second with 4.3 billion, followed by 'The Boys' on Amazon Prime with 4.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the cable news viewership saw a 52% surge from a year ago, thanks to the Republican National Convention and the coverage of the assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe massive viewership on streaming platforms show audiences are increasingly moving away from cable networks, which recorded a TV usage share of 26.7% for the month.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G in Bengaluru; Editing by Shreya Biswas)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Bank of America strategists disclosed on Tuesday the eight most widely held individual stocks globally. Based on the percentage of relevant funds holding these stocks, the top holdings are TSMC (94%), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (87%), Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) (85%), HDFC Bank (81%), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (77%), Sony (NYSE:SONY) (75%), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (75%), and ASML (AS:ASML) (75%).\n\nIn July, as global equities saw a 1.5% rally, long-only funds globally increased their active equity exposure by a total of $10.1 billion, according to BofA’s analysis of 7,746 funds managing $30 trillion.\n\nIndustrials emerged as the favored sector for the month. Funds notably boosted their active exposure to Europe by $10.5 billion, with $7.8 billion directed specifically towards Industrials.\n\nIn the U.S., while overall active exposure remained relatively stable with a $1.2 billion increase, there was a significant $30.3 billion rise in exposure to Industrials, alongside a reduction in Consumer Discretionary and Tech holdings.\n\nAccording to BofA, this shift aligns with historical trends, where the global Industrials sector typically outperforms during periods of economic upturn, as indicated by the rising Global Wave, the bank’s economic indicator that tracks the global business cycle.\n\nYear-to-date, long-only funds have shown increasing optimism about the global economic cycle by reducing cash levels and reallocating from bonds to equities.\n\nThese funds have added a cumulative $58.4 billion to global equities, with the largest increases seen in Europe ($27.9 billion), the U.S. ($18.2 billion), Emerging Markets ($15.2 billion), and APxJ ($7.3 billion). This has more than offset the $10.2 billion reduction in active exposure to Japan, strategists point out.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese 8 names are the most widely held stocks in the world\n\nPwC loses major client Bank of China amid regulatory probe\n\nKingsoft Cloud Q2 revenue rises, stock dips premarket\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What do Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg have in common? They’re part of the $100 billion club. That is, the only 15 people on planet Earth who have 12-figure fortunes.\n\nTogether, their combined wealth exceeds $2.2 trillion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's more than the market cap of Google-parent Alphabet, at $2 trillion, or Amazon at $1.8 trillion.\n\nMost of those with net worth above $100 billion founded tech companies and, as a result, own huge amounts of stock in some of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nWith an estimated net worth of $245 billion, Tesla, X and Space X owner Elon Musk sits at the top of the list, followed by Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos, and then Bernard Arnault the founder and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company.\n\nFrenchman Arnault is just one of two European centibillionaires to make the list, including including Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Inditex fashion group, perhaps best known for its chains Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka.\n\nOrtega, who still owns 59% of Inditex, joined the club just last month as the retail group posted record sales.\n\nMost other members of the $100 billion club are based in America.\n\nThe 15 billionaires with net worth over $100 billion, as estimated by Bloomberg:\n\n1. Elon Musk, Tesla, X and SpaceX owner\r\nNet worth: $245B\n\n2. Jeff Bezos, Amazon and Blue Origin founder\r\nNet worth: $201B\n\n3. Bernard Arnault, LVMH founder and CEO\r\nNet worth: $197B\n\n4. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta co-founder and CEO\r\nNet worth: $188B\n\n5. Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder \r\nNet worth: $158B\n\n6. Larry Ellison, Oracle cofounder \r\nNet worth: $153B\n\n7. Larry Page, Alphabet co-founder \r\nNet worth: $150B\n\n8. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s former CEO and owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers\r\nNet worth: $146B\n\n9.

Amancio Ortega, Inditex founder \r\nNet worth: $105B\n\nAll but one of them have grown richer this year—despite stock troubles and charitable donations\n\nArnault—who started the year as the world’s richest person—would be over $10 billion richer, if it wasn’t for a stock price bloodbath in the European luxury sector earlier this year.\n\nHe is the only member of the $100 billion club whose net worth has tumbled this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany others on the list would be much wealthier if it weren’t for the recent dip in big tech shares.\n\nEarlier this month, the world’s 500 richest people saw $134 billion wiped from their fortunes overnight, thanks to AI uncertainty and high-profile earnings disappointments.\n\nBezos saw a nearly $16 billion drop in his wealth in one day, when Amazon’s shares fell by nearly 9% on August 2.\n\nLikewise, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page’s net worth took a $3 billion hit each.\n\nRemarkably, others like Gates and Warren Buffett are still on the list despite giving billions to charity and pledging to drop off the list of the world’s wealthiest people altogether.\n\nThe Microsoft cofounder has vouched to give away “virtually all” of his $158 billion fortune to address society’s most pressing problems. The 68-year-old reckons it'll take him 20 years to hit his goal.\n\nNvidia's Jensen Huang is a newcomer to the list\n\nAs well as Ortega, Jensen Huang is another new entrant to $100 billion club.\n\nThe Nvidia co-founder and CEO saw his wealth balloon from $44 billion at the start of this year to around $114 billion today, thanks to the success of his chipmaker company.\n\nNvidia has made itself a key player in the AI boom by supplying hardware to companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. It’s now the second most valuable company in the world—worth over $3 trillion—behind only Apple.\n\nThe elite club, which had just one member in 2020, could get even bigger soon. Three members of the Walton family—which owns Walmart—are sitting on $92 billion-plus fortunes after each grew at least $22 billion richer this year.\n\nBut either way, centibillionaires shouldn't get too comfortable.\n\nBettencourt Meyers, an heir to the L'Oreal fortune, became the first woman to amass a 12-figure fortune in December last year, after shares of the cosmetics company posted their best year since 1998.\n\nBut her time in the $100 billion club was fleeting and her net worth has since dropped below $90 billion.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "It's been a bit of a tough year for Cathie Wood, the maverick fund manager and chief of Ark Invest. She forged a reputation as a risk taker and won a lot of followers over the years -- and some naysayers. This was in part due to her penchant for huge claims, like her $2.3 million price target for Bitcoin, and in part because of her track record over the last few years.\n\nWood's flagship fund, the Ark Invest Innovation ETF, missed out on much of what has been the defining innovation of the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI). She was an early skeptic on Nvidia and a huge proponent of Tesla. Ark's flagship ETF is down roughly 19% in 2024, while the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 13% in the same time period.\n\nJust because Wood hasn't done a stellar job picking stocks recently doesn't mean her streak will continue. Her run in 2021 was pretty impressive. And maybe that Tesla bet really will pay off someday.\n\nWhen the market dropped from its recent highs, Wood had the opportunity to hit the bargain bin. Let's take a look at a few stocks she purchased.\n\nWood scooped up shares of AI powerhouse Amazon\n\nWood bought more than $1 million worth of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shares across five of her funds in the week of Aug. 11. She purchased them for about 10% less than what they were trading for the prior week. I'd say that's a decent discount.\n\nI think it's a great pick, as well. I've been a big fan of Amazon (as an investment) for some time. The company has positioned itself to take full advantage of the AI revolution while strengthening its core e-commerce business.\n\nIt posted some relatively disappointing revenue growth for Q2 recently, up a tepid 10% year over year, but its earnings-per-share (EPS) growth was phenomenal and beat estimates. The company nearly doubled its EPS for the quarter, compared to last year.\n\nAmazon still controls the vast majority of online retail, a market that will continue to gain on its brick-and-mortar sibling. The company is also the market leader in cloud infrastructure, which will allow it to reap the rewards of generative AI as that technology takes off. If those two weren't enough reasons to buy, the company's advertising segment is growing at lightning speed.\n\nAI-powered medicine is a big bet for Wood\n\nWood bought more than $1.5 million worth of Tempus AI (NASDAQ: TEM) shares for two of her funds. This was at a more than 15% discount from the stock's peak at the end of July.\n\nTempus is an interesting play. It uses AI to create precision medicine solutions -- i.e., solutions tailored to the individual -- for patients in oncology, cardiology, and who are suffering from depression. If the tech can be proven at scale, it could be a significant leap in treating these areas of disease.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has yet to turn a profit, but it's far from pre-revenue, pulling in more than $530 million last year.\n\nAnother health-tech company was one of Wood's biggest buys\n\nNatera (NASDAQ: NTRA) is a genetic testing company that specializes in non-invasive solutions. This one didn't come at a discount -- the stock has steadily marched upward as the company has continued to report solid numbers. Natera is still in the red, but it's been marching toward turning a profit at increasing speed. The company's latest earnings smashed expectations, beating EPS estimates by more than 50%.\n\nHowever, I would exercise caution with Natera. It's facing a class-action lawsuit alleging it engaged in unfair and deceptive billing practices. This wasn't the first time the company faced similar charges. It settled a lawsuit in 2018 brought by the Department of Justice on allegations of fraud for $11 million.\n\nOf course, companies face lawsuits all the time. This suit may be baseless, but for my money, I'd look elsewhere.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AMD (AMD)\n\nAMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9bn (£3.77bn) cash and stock transaction, as the chip company seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34bn in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker said ZT Systems, will help it \"deliver leadership AI training and inferencing solutions\" and will also help \"cloud and enterprise customers significantly accelerate the deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale\". ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers” such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).\n\nRead more: Wage growth likely to trigger next rise in triple lock state pension\n\nAMD has funnelled more than $1bn into expanding its artificial intelligence ecosystem and strengthening its AI software capabilities over the last 12 months, in addition to its research and development investments, the company said.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW)\n\nShares in the cybersecurity firm were higher in pre-market trading after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nPalo Alto reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $2.18bn, up 12% from the year-ago period and slightly above analysts' estimates. Net income was $357.7m or $1.01 per share, gaining from the year prior and ahead of projections.\n\nFor the full year of fiscal 2024, revenue and net income were stronger than analysts expected at $8.03bn and $2.58bn, respectively.\n\nThe firm expects revenue between $9.1bn and $9.15bn, up between 12% and 13% year-over-year in line with estimates of $9.11bn.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenue to grow between 12% and 13% to between $2.1bn and $2.13bn, compared to estimates of $2.11bn.\n\n\"We finished off the year with strong execution on our platformisation strategy,\" Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora said, adding that \"as we look forward to fiscal year 2025 and beyond, we are focused on scaling our Next-Generation Security business through continued innovation and execution\".\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nMedia executive Edgar Bronfman Jr on Monday submitted a $4.3bn bid for acquiring National Amusements, the company that holds a controlling interest in entertainment giant Paramount Global, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBronfman's offer includes $2.4bn in debt and equity for National Amusements. He also would contribute $1.5bn to Paramount's balance sheet, which could be used to pay down.\n\nHis bid comes over a month after Redstone entered a deal with David Ellison’s Skydance Global, which will merge Paramount with Skydance and create a new company with Ellison at the helm.\n\nRead more: UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch among those missing in Sicily yacht disaster\n\nThat agreement contained a 45-day \"go-shop period\" that allowed Paramount to solicit and evaluate other offers. That period ends on 21 August, but can be extended.\n\nBronfman’s offer potentially complicates Paramount’s fate, especially as the Skydance merger was reached after years of negotiations with different parties. The bid adds $400m to cover a breakup fee to end a rival deal.\n\nA special committee of Paramount's board is expected to meet Wednesday to determine whether Bronfman's offer has a reasonable probability of succeeding.\n\nAntofagasta (ANTO.L)\n\nAntofagasta’s pretax profit declined in line with market expectations in the first six months of the year, when strong commodity prices offset lower sales volumes.\n\nThe Chilean copper miner said its pretax profit fell 7% to $712.6m in the half-year from $764.5m in the same period last year. This is still above the consensus forecast of $710.6m.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the first six months of the year rose to $1.39bn from $1.33bn last year.\n\nThe company saw increased depreciation and amortisation, mainly due to the start of depreciating the assets at the Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion project, which is now in operation.\n\nLooking ahead, the miner reaffirmed full-year production guidance for output to be at the lower end of the 670,000-710,000 tonne range.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "SQ, INTU, AMZN: Which Strong Buy Tech Stock Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "Stocks are on an unstoppable hot streak right now, with eight straight sessions in the green for the S&P 500 (SPX), the longest win streak since last November. Undoubtedly, Technology stocks are leading the path higher, just weeks after many investors thought the markets would tank and that less-loved mid-cap and value plays would lead us higher. With Tech stocks in the driver’s seat again, it may be time for many to revisit the drawing board for value from the latest swoon.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to gauge which trio of tech titans — SQ, INTU, and AMZN — has the most year-ahead upside, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nBlock, formerly known as Square, is a financial technology company (it owns Cash App and other services) whose shares have been choppily consolidating in a wide range in recent years. Indeed, the stock has broken the hearts of many investors, but the tides may be about to change.\n\nRecently, Bank of America (BAC) pounded the table on SQ stock, noting “undervaluation” and “underappreciation.” With potentially overlooked catalysts (think the major corporate restructure) on the horizon, I’m staying bullish on the stock.\n\nNow down close to 9% in the past two years and 13.5% year-to-date, SQ stock seems like a Tech sector dud. Despite beating handsomely on earnings for the past two quarters, the stock seems to lack the excitement factor it once had. Whether it’s a lack of blockchain innovations or operating challenges that led CEO and “Block Head” Jack Dorsey to reorganize his entire company, investors are demanding more from the firm in the AI age. Whether last month’s corporate reshuffling helps Block regain its competitive spirit again remains to be seen.\n\nRegardless, the company has plans to get back on the high road. Specifically, the company’s “Rule of 40” by 2026 plan sets a pretty high (but realistic) bar, with gross profit and adjusted operating income targets set at 15% and 25% (a sum of 40%), respectively.\n\nBank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg, who has a Buy rating on the stock and an $82.00 per share price target entailing more than 22% upside, praised Block for already “demonstrating nice progress” on its Rule of 40. As Block pushes for greater efficiency, the firm must introduce new innovations to jolt sales. Introducing new financial services in the Cash App ecosystem (like Cash App Borrow) is worth banking on.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for SQ Stock?\n\nSQ stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 24 Buys, six Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average SQ stock price target of $88.90 implies 32.9% upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee more SQ analyst ratings\n\nIntuit (INTU)\n\nShares of financial technology software firm Intuit (mostly known for its tax-filing software, TurboTax) are flirting with new highs again, now down just over 5% from all-time highs and 2% away from 52-week highs. Undoubtedly, the $670 ceiling of resistance has proven challenging to break through over the past six months. As the company looks to lay off and rehire with AI in mind, perhaps investors seeking “AI monetization” plays will have more to love from the name from a longer-term perspective. Though the valuation multiple has expanded considerably in recent weeks, I’m inclined to stay bullish on INTU stock.\n\nIntuit is serious about AI-driven growth. But unlike many other firms that are more than willing to overinvest than underinvest (think Alphabet (GOOGL)), Intuit is also serious about keeping its balance sheet in great shape while emphasizing driving operating efficiencies. As more investors reward return on AI investment rather than the ambition of AI narratives and the size of spending budgets, Intuit may just be one of the firms that starts standing out from the pack, if it hasn’t already.\n\nIntuit’s AI offering, Intuit Assist, is an innovative tool designed to enhance productivity in financial software by providing AI-driven assistance and insights. Over time, it could become highly monetizable, similar to how Microsoft (MSFT) has successfully monetized Copilot. Whether Intuit can achieve the same success remains to be seen, but it is clear that financial software is a sector poised for significant AI-driven disruption, and Intuit is positioned well to ride that wave.\n\nIndeed, Intuit stands to add immense value for users by sprinkling generative AI across QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp to improve the user experience. With value creation comes the opportunity to charge higher prices. At the end of the day, users will likely be more than willing to open their wallets wider if there’s more value, whether that’s in the form of time savings or increased accuracy.\n\nAt 34.7 times forward price-to-earnings, INTU stock is on the pricier side of its past-year historical range. Given its realistic opportunity to monetize AI and the generative AI operating system (GenOS) it’s built from the ground up, I’d argue the premium is worth paying.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for INTU Stock?\n\nINTU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 18 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. The average INTU stock price target of $722.61 implies 8.9% upside potential.\n\nSee more INTU analyst ratings\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nShares of e-commerce and cloud behemoth Amazon cratered in July and earlier this month as the market sell-off dragged the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) into correction territory. Undoubtedly, it wasn’t just investors turning against tech that caused AMZN stock to crumble nearly 25% from peak to trough. The company’s latest quarter left a lot to be desired.\n\nIn any case, AMZN stock has an opportunity to take its relief rally into high gear as investors focus on the road ahead and growth drivers that could help the firm level up. As one of the more magnificent buy-the-dip opportunities today, I’m inclined to stay bullish on the stock.\n\nUp ahead, look for Amazon to reveal more specifics on how it intends to take on Chinese e-commerce rivals like PDD Holdings’ (PDD) Temu at the very low end of the cost spectrum.\n\nUndoubtedly, Amazon has a lot of market share to take on the low end of e-commerce, and I think Amazon has more than enough tools to get the job done and done well. The Magnificent Seven behemoth certainly does logistics better than most. However, the big question remains whether it can minimize costs and shipping times on goods coming from China.\n\nAs Amazon’s low-cost marketplace goes live this fall, perhaps some of the enthusiasm propelling PDD stock can spread over to AMZN. As the early reviews release, we’ll gain a glimpse of what could be one of Amazon’s next big growth avenues. At 42.4 times trailing P/E, AMZN is still pricier than most of its Magnificent Seven peers. However, given the opportunity to steal Temu’s lunch and continued advancements on the AI front (Amazon just bought another AI firm, Perceive, a few days ago), such a premium is well-earned.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?\n\nAMZN stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 41 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average AMZN stock price target of $223.58 implies 25.5% upside potential.\n\nSee more AMZN analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThere are plenty of underappreciated Tech stocks that have room to soar even higher as the market rebound endures. Whether we’re talking about Block and progress on its “Rule of 40,” Intuit and its enviable AI monetization opportunity, or Amazon and the potential of its coming Temu rival, the following trio have the catalysts they need to ascend. Of the trio, Wall Street sees the most upside (33%) in SQ stock. I’m inclined to agree with analysts. If Jack Dorsey can right the ship, SQ stock’s comeback could be pronounced.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): This AI Stock Is Trending Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\n\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. One of the important areas where the tech giant is implementing AI solutions is the web services business. This business, which grew 19% during the second-quarter and accounted for more than $26 billion in revenue, beat the Wall Street consensus estimates by close to 2% of around 17.6%. AI chips used to implement features on the cloud are slowly coming towards a better supply balance and the narrative around the AI prowess of the firm is also improving.\n\nThese developments regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are encouraging, according to analysts at investment advisory RBC Capital. The advisory has an Outperform rating on the shares with a price target of $215, and recently noted that the bull thesis on the firm was largely on track as investments in AI infrastructure to help support web services demand looked to be paying off.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon’s delivery drones are too loud for the residents where it’s testing the program",
        "content": "Tests for Amazon’s drone delivery program have become a regular fact of life for residents of College Station, Texas.\n\nThe town, which is home to Texas A&M University, is the testing ground for Amazon’s drone delivery program. The program started in 2022, and its main goal is to figure out how to use drones to fulfill some of the estimated 5.9 billion packages Amazon delivered in 2023. The idea, in theory at least, is that these unmanned drones would pick up an order for the usual household items and tchotchkes people order on Amazon and deposit them at their house. As CEO Andy Jassy told investors in a letter last year, the Prime Air delivery drones will eventually allow Amazon to deliver packages in under an hour. “It won’t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time,” wrote Jassy in his annual shareholder letter. “Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?”\n\nHowever, as with most matters relating to shipping logistics, the practice is much more complicated. And for the 127,000 people of College Station, the din from the drones has become a nuisance, according to CNBC.\n\n“It sounds like a giant hive of bees,” John Case, who has lived in the town for 40 years, told CNBC. “You know it’s coming because it’s pretty loud.”\n\nAnother College Station resident, Amina Alikhan, described the noise to CNBC as “a fly coming by your ear over and over, and you can’t make it stop.”\n\nThe noise levels could get worse in the near future. In May, Amazon submitted a proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase the number of drone flights from 200 per day to 469.\n\nIn July, in response to Amazon’s proposal, College Station Mayor John Nichols wrote a letter to the FAA.\n\n“With the potential to increase the frequency of drone deliveries to the amount stated in Amazon Prime Air’s request, residents have continued to voice their concerns to City Council that the noise levels will only get worse and will impact the enjoyment of their property,” Nichols wrote in the letter.\n\nDuring a city council meeting in June, College Station city manager Bryan C. Woods said he conducted several tests of the drones and found their noise levels were between 47 and 61 decibels. Sixty decibels is roughly the same noise level of an office, according to a chart from Yale Environmental Health and Safety. Woods added a caveat to his findings by saying they were “anecdotal.”\n\nAmazon held a Zoom call with residents of College Station, in which an executive told them the company would not renew its lease in the Texas metro and planned to move by October 2025, according to CNBC.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said the company takes local feedback under consideration “wherever possible.” Stephenson left open the possibility Amazon could move to another location. “As our program evolves, we’re considering a variety of potential paths forward—including the possibility of alternate sites.”\n\nIn May, Amazon cleared a major regulatory hurdle with the FAA opening a path for it to expand its drone delivery program. The FAA approved Amazon’s request to have its drones fly greater distances outside the line of sight of the person piloting it on the ground. The FAA granted Amazon’s request after the company developed a technology that ensured the drones avoided collisions. Several other companies working on drone delivery systems, such asAlphabet and Walmart, have also developed similar capabilities for their drones.\n\nHowever, even before the noise complaints, it hasn’t been entirely smooth sailing for Amazon’s Prime Air program. First announced by Jeff Bezos in 2013 during a 60 Minutesinterview, the initiative’s progress stalled for several years. Even at the time Bezos predicted the project would take years to perfect, foreseeing numerous complexities.\n\n“The hard part is putting in all the redundancy, all the reliability, all the systems you need to say, ‘Look, this thing can’t land on somebody’s head when they're walking around their neighborhood,’” Bezos told 60 Minutes. “That’s not good.”\n\nIn 2023, Prime Air hit a major setback when it was caught up in an intense round of cost cutting across the company that resulted in numerous layoffs in the division. A few months later, in August 2023, two key executives left, including the one in charge of all testing operations.\n\nCollege Station wasn’t the only Prime Air testing site that ran into trouble by disturbing local residents. Amazon had a similar testing facility in Lockeford, Calif., a town of about 4,000 people 40 miles south of Sacramento. When news broke that Prime Air was bringing a slew of drones to town, residents reportedly contemplated shooting them down, according to the Washington Post. In April, Amazon left the town altogether, announcing it was moving drone testing to Tolleson, Ariz.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jeff Bezos Said 'I Predict One Day Amazon Will Fail' And Claims Large Companies Only Last '30-Plus Years' – Guess How Old Amazon Is?",
        "content": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) just hit its 30th anniversary, a huge milestone for a company that started as an online bookstore and became a global tech giant. Jeff Bezos's belief that most big companies only last around 30 years makes this anniversary even more interesting.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. This startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.\n\nBack in 2018, during a company meeting, Bezos reportedly mentioned, \"If you look at large companies, their life spans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\" In that same meeting, he said, \"I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.\"\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nBezos, who founded Amazon in 1994, has often discussed how businesses have a natural life cycle. He's pointed out that as companies grow, they face big challenges – like market changes and new technology – that could eventually bring them down. But Bezos isn't just being negative. He's used this idea to shape Amazon's strategy and keep the company moving forward.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nOne of the key ideas Bezos has championed at Amazon is his \"Day One\" mindset. This approach is all about staying nimble and keeping the energy of a startup, no matter how big Amazon gets. Bezos wrote in a 2017 letter to shareholders, \"Day Two is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by an excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day One.\"\n\nAs CEO, Bezos stressed the importance of being obsessed with customers and thinking long-term. His 2020 letter to shareholders said, \"If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume.\"\n\nTrending: Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nThe idea that big companies only last about 30 years isn't just an assumption Bezos made – it's backed up by data. For example, the average time a company stays in the S&P 500 index has dropped from 33 years in 1964 to just 24 years in 2016. This is mostly because of rapid technological changes and constantly emerging competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile many companies fail to survive past a few decades, some survive much longer. Hertz, for instance, was founded in 1918 and lasted over 100 years before it filed for bankruptcy in 2020. On the other hand, companies like Wells Fargo, Boeing, and Ford have been around for over a century, proving that while it's tough, it's not impossible to stick around.\n\nTrending: Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors up to $300 back in bonus for new users.\n\nAs Amazon neared its 30-year mark, Bezos made headlines for selling many of his Amazon shares. In February 2024, he sold 50 million shares worth $8.5 billion, followed by another sale worth $5 billion in July 2024. These sales are part of Bezos's broader strategy to fund his other ventures, including space exploration through Blue Origin and various philanthropic efforts.\n\nOver the past three decades, Amazon's journey has been marked by big achievements and challenges. The company has grown into one of the world's largest retailers, with a market valuation exceeding $2 trillion. Its success can be attributed to Bezos's visionary leadership and his ability to anticipate market trends and adapt accordingly.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Jeff Bezos Said 'I Predict One Day Amazon Will Fail' And Claims Large Companies Only Last '30-Plus Years' – Guess How Old Amazon Is? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) is one of the largest Chinese equities in the word, having a market capitalization of approximately $180 billion at $75 per share. Renowned as one of the fastest-growing companies in the world, it has become a dominant figure in Asia's e-commerce, finance and service industries.\n\nOver the past several years, it had to navigate through China's evolving political landscape and economic objectives. However, China remains the world's largest e-commerce market and Alibaba is one of its major players.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nAs such, I am bullish on the stock because of its strategic market positioning, which I believe will give it upward trajectory. Although the company continues to enjoy high profit margins, its current valuation appears discounted due to the geopolitical risks. However, I believe these concerts are overblown since it has extensive operations and geographical diversification.\n\nFurther, Alibaba's business model is quite similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) as its operations are divided into several segments. Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook\n\nThe Taobao and Tmall unit is the largest segment. Taobao is an online platform which primarily operates on a model of selling advertising wherein the sellers pay for increased visibility of their products. Tmall is a business-to-consumer platform primarily targeting big brands and makes its revenue through charging commissions per transaction.\n\nThe Cloud Intelligence Group provides a range of services, such as cloud computing, data storage, big-data processing and artificial intelligence through subscriptions.\n\nThe International and Digital Commerce segment is made up of AliExpress, Trendyol, Lazada and Alibaba. These are business-to-consumer marketplaces that generate revenue through commissions, advertising, logistics and support services. Alibaba, on the other hand, does have the same structure but serves only business to business.\n\nThe Cainiao division is responsible for logistics, which consists of storage, fulfillment and shipping services for the more than 200 countries.\n\nGlobal trends and financial perspective\n\nEcommerceDb forecasts the e-commerce market is likely to hit $5.14 trillion by the end of 2024, having grown at a compound annual rate of about 15% since 2019. China remains the leader in this space, with over 50% market share for global e-commerce sales. Projections for 2025 indicate the market will grow to $3.30 trillion, with Alibaba being its main player. Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook\n\nIf we look into the company's financial performance, Alibaba performed well in the first quarter of 2024, beating earnings estimates. The international e-commerce segment generated $3.80 billion revenue, contributing to 12% of its total revenue of $30.70 billion, which saw a 7% year-over-year increase. This segment proved to be the fastest growing with an increase of 45% year over year. Earnings per share came in at $1.40, beating estimates by 12.90%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is important to note that Alibaba has continued to expand internationally, especially through its cloud services and other generative artificial intelligence technologies, which have driven a 30% increase in contribution in e-commerce orders. In the fourth quarter, Chinese commerce contribution still dominated through Taobao and Tmall, which generated $12.90 billion. Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook\n\nThis quarter marks a highly aggressive internationalization strategy in marketing through employing global icons like David Beckham as brand ambassadors and sponsoring international events like Euros 2024, clearly indicating its future direction is focusing on international growth.\n\nAdditionally, Alibaba is a leader in China's generative AI infrastructure services sector. It plans to integrate AI to its international commerce business, which include websites like AliExpress. This will help maintain its advantage over local competitors in the long run.\n\nThe main reason for my bullish stance on Alibaba is its financial indicators. The stock trades with a current cash ratio of 44%, a 17.86 price-earnings ratio, a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.42, price-sales ratio of 1.51 and price-book ratio of 1.37, which are all well below the sector median, indicating major undervaluation. The stock also offers a 1.32% annual dividend yield, which is a bit insignificant even for dividend-focused investors seeing the kind of capital appreciation on the offer. It is just a type of stock that serves every kind of investor.\n\nCash is king, and that's exactly what Alibaba has. The latest balance sheet shows liabilities of $62.10 billion due within a year and liabilities of $31.80 billion due after that. On the other hand, it had $85.30 billion in cash and $8.90 billion in receivables due within a year. These liquid assets approximately match the total liabilities, suggesting its balance sheet is solid. The fact Alibaba has more cash than debt is a strong indicator of its ability to manage its debt safely. Additionally, Ebit grew by 20% over the last year, further bolstering its capacity to handle debt and corroborating my bullish thesis.\n\nThe company has also been aggressive with its share repurchase program, spending around $5.80 billion to buy back 77 million American depositary shares during the quarter that ended in June 2024. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, it repurchased a total of 1.25 billion ordinary shares, amounting to $12.50 billion. This buyback not only demonstrates that management is bullish on the company's future operating and financial performances, but it also signaling to the market that Alibaba's shares are undervalued.\n\nWhen it comes to competitors, I believe it is more viable to compare it to its greatest rival, which is Amazon. Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook\n\nAlthough both companies' revenue growth rates have been nearly the same over the last five years, it is much more appreciable for Amazon as it has a larger revenue base. However, Alibaba's extremely attractive level of Ebitda and net margin needs to be highlighted. These indicators show the company did not give up profitability to grow, which is what a value investor looks at.\n\nTo carry out the company's valuation, I will use the comparative valuation method with price-earnings and PEG. Understanding Alibaba's Market Position, Financial Outlook\n\nOn the subject of valuation, the company presents a comprehensive discount when compared to its peers. The companies' average forward price- earnings ratio is 15 (sector median), which is well above Alibaba's (9.42). Even if we look at the forward PEG ratio, which also incorporates the future growth, we have an average of 1.07 for the two companies, which implies an upside potential of 50% for Alibaba stock in the next 12 months.\n\nPotential risks\n\nNow let's talk about some risks when it comes to investing in Alibaba.\n\nThe biggest risk is the geopolitical issues that surround the relationship between the United States and China. Alibaba's operations have been affected by tariffs were put in place on Chinese imports, which had a huge impact on its business.\n\nApart from the macroeconomic challenges, competition in China is rising. New players such as Pinduoduo (PDD), with a group purchase business model, and Douyin have emerged as formidable opponents. Nonetheless, Alibaba has been preemptive in handling the threat by putting in measures that have included launching the Taobao Deals platform back in 2020 as a way of offering prices that are affordable and directly connecting consumers with manufactures to counter PDD. Moreover, PDD has been dealing with malware and cybersecurity issues for a long time, so it will take time to gain consumers' trust and be considered a main player.\n\nFinal words\n\nDespite the risks that comes with a U.S. election year, the company has taken various measures to diversify its business and geographies so that it is able to effectively compete.\n\nAlibaba remains an e-commerce leader as far as its market is concerned. Although China has recently shown signs of maturity, the current discounted valuation and attractive margins supersedes that concern. With the company's generative AI innovations and aggressive international marketing approach providing a solid foundation for growth, and with the undervaluation of the stock coupled with the most attractive forward price-earnings and PEG ratios, Alibaba presents itself as a great opportunity for all kinds of investors.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI",
        "content": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a giant in the realms of e-commerce, cloud computing and digital entertainment. The company, which was initially established as an online bookstore in 1994, has become one of the most influential companies in the world.\n\nWith services such as Amazon Prime and the cloud computing service AWS, strong customer orientation alongside technological leading-edge products, it not only changed the retail industry, but created unprecedented new benchmarks. Even amid market fluctuations, Amazon has been continuously demonstrating the sustainability factor, satisfying investors with optimistic results and new innovations. In my opinion, Amazon's Cloud strength and operating income momentum are solid indicators to where the company's focus lies.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nThis analysis dives into Amazon's operating and financial status, strategic decisions and future opportunities and why it is poised to stay as a potential opportunity for value investors.\n\nResilience amidst market volatility\n\nThe company's first-quarter 2024 performance was well-received by the market, but the stock has shown quite a bit of volatility since then. At one point, it fluctuated very close to the $200 resistance level, but did not cross it. However, when Amazon released a mixed second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 1, shares dropped 7% in after-hours trading, which, in my opinion, was an overstated response from the market.\n\nThe e-commerce giant delivered mixed results, beating earnings per share expectations but falling short on the revenue front. The consensus for earnings was $1.02, while its actual earnings were $1.26, which was 24 cents higher than projections. However, with revenue of $147.98 billion, Amazon missed Wall Street's forecast by $780 million. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nWhat stood out from Amazon's earnings release, and what we will be focusing on in this discussion, was the strong acceleration of growth and the massive operating income improvements in the Cloud segment. While e-commerce in North America also performed well for, the force undoubtedly belongs to the Cloud segment that is now expected to generate over $40 billion of the run-rate operating income in the next year. I believe investors are underestimating the potential for operating income growth, which may support further increases to its valuation and indicates where Amazon's future focus is pointed.\n\nAn in-depth look at financials\n\nContrary to headlines, overall, the second quarter was a good one for Amazon. Total revenue was up by 10.12% year over year, bringing total revenue for the first half up by 11.29%. The combination of an additional $13.59 billion in revenue and improved efficiency enabled the company to generate $14.67 billion in operating income, translating to a 91.02% year-over-year increase ($6.99 billion). However, the total revenue declined as compared to the previous quarter by 3 percentage points, primarily due to a slowdown in the e-commerce segment.\n\nStory continues Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nAmazon Web Services, however, witnessed an increasing rate of revenue growth, rising from 17.20% in the first quarter to 18.88% in the second quarter. This is primarily due to the company's decision to transition from on-premise infrastructure to cloud solutions, citing the increasing demand to implement artificial intelligence technologies. Cloud businesses overall have remained robust during the most recent quarter with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) posting healthy revenue growth, suggesting these companies know where the future lies and are not cutting back on digital transformation investments.\n\nOne of main takeaways from the earnings report that I believe we will see more and more of in the future is that there is sustained operating income growth across all of Amazon's operations, especially cloud. With a market share of more than 30%, the cloud segment delivered 19% year-over-year growth. This was mainly due to signing new services contracts with Databricks, ServiceNow and GE HealthCare, among others, which I believe will only increase in the future.\n\nThe most critical figure is the amount of operating income the AWS segment incrementally added to the results. In the second quarter, the segment contributed $9.30 billion to operating income, which is a whopping 74% increase year over year. In comparison, the Google Cloud segment posted $1.20 billion in operating income. That means AWS made 8 times more profit for Amazon over the same period.\n\nAWS is progressing toward becoming a $100 billion-plus annual revenue company with around $40 billion of recurring operating income. Importantly, 57% of its total operating income growth came from the AWS segment in the second quarter. As we are entering a new generation of technological growth focused on AI, Amazon looks poised to capitalize on it like it did with the cloud in the early 2010s.\n\nIt is not just Amazon driving cloud growth, however. The whole cloud market is experiencing exponential growth. Currently, projections form Precedence Research indicate the cloud computing market has the potential to reach $2.30 trillion, growing at a rate of 17% annually with 2023 as the base year. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nAdvertising is another segment that has been expanding rapidly for Amazon, generating over $2 billion in additional revenue year over year. As such, there is potential in video advertising within the Prime Video service.\n\nValuations\n\nCurrently, Amazon shares trade at a price-earnings ratio of 45, making it the second most expensive large-cap tech company after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which trades at a price-earnings ratio of 56. However, from a long-term earnings per share growth perspective, Amazon arguably remains one of the best investments as it is projected to grow its earnings at an annual rate of 23% in the long term, mainly because of its cloud business. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon justifiably trades at one of the highest earnings multiples due to its stronger-than-average projected earnings per share growth. This growth primarily hinges on cloud and despite a slight top-line miss in the second quarter by the company as a whole, the cloud growth story remains intact. AWS is positioned for significant growth and new contract wins. I see operating income margin expansion as a catalyst for the stock, along with continued AI spending. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nGrowth in the AI and cloud markets requires constant investment. Amazon is sitting on $71.18 billion in cash on hand, with an additional $17.91 billion in short-term investments. With $89.09 billion in liquidity and only $54.89 billion in long-term debt, the company has a strong balance sheet, allowing it to allocate capital as needed to expand its operations without concerns about debt obligations.\n\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, this is the 8th consecutive quarter where Amazon's cash from operations increased along with its free cash flow. Having surpassed $100 billion in cash from operations on a trailing 12-month basis, the company is still spending over $50 billion annually on capital expenditures and generating $54.98 billion in free cash flow. I believe this allows it to continue increasing the amount of cash from operations it makes, and even if they feel the need to increase capex during the AI boom to accelerate growth, it should ultimately correlate to higher growth in FCF. Hence, it would have no apparent problem putting in more cash to accelerate its cloud and AI dominance.\n\nRisks\n\nDespite Amazon's dominance, there are still some risks to consider as an investor. The biggest risk, in my view, is a potential slowdown in the cloud business or operating margin contraction if the U.S. enters a recession. While the company's cloud business is growing rapidly, its reliance on this segment for operating income gains is increasing.\n\nAnother risk lies in the e-commerce segment, which it still heavily relies on. The business accounted for over 65% of total second-quarter revenue. A recession could lead to reduced consumer spending, impacting e-commerce sales. It is essential not to overlook the challenges in the retail segment while focusing on AWS's growth. Having said that, Amazon's massive e-commerce scale suggests it is well-positioned to weather weakness compared to smaller peers.\n\nMoreover, Amazon Prime membership gives the company a highly competitive advantage to keep its e-commerce dominance. As seen below, its fast and reliable shipping capabilities are considered the \"number one reason\" for Prime membership. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nThe Amazon Prime-driven competitive advantages extend into Prime video. Over the past year, its advertising business has generated over $50 billion in revenue, positioning the company incredibly well in the digital advertising market. Beyond E-Commerce: Amazon Sees Its Future in Cloud, AI\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAmazon offers a promising growth outlook for the third quarter. With impressive cloud results, especially with regard to the incremental operating income growth, the company looks set to capture the cloud market as it did with the e-commerce market a decade ago. The Cloud segment is on track to achieve $40 billion or more in annual recurring operating income over the next 12 months based on run-rate results and with the secured contract wins for AWS segment in the second quarter alone.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, both sales growth and the operating margin look very good and are likely to remain strong going forward. This suggests that earnings per share can continue its upward trajectory for fiscal 2025. I see a huge opportunity in Amazon for long-term investors as generative AI and machine learning will drive additional revenue across various business segments in the future. The company's financial metrics are moving in the right direction, and based on historical levels, this may be one of the best times to invest in the stock.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage these days. Since OpenAI's breakthrough with ChatGPT, companies are racing to cash in on this fast-growing market. Investors can also profit from Wall Street's newest obsession by buying shares of companies that look likely to ride this wave for a while.\n\nHere are two examples: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Fiverr(NYSE: FVRR). The former is down big time over the past month, while the latter has been struggling for much longer. However, both could move in the right direction over the long run.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOn Aug. 5, equity markets suffered their worst day in nearly two years. Amazon did not escape the sell-off, although, in fairness, the company's shares were declining even before that. Over the past month, the tech giant's stock is down almost 13% -- a massive dip for a company worth $1.79 trillion. However, in five years, hardly anyone will remember this moment. Amazon should bounce back and still perform well over the long run, partly thanks to its work in AI, which is helping boost its most profitable segment: Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company's cloud computing-focused arm offers AI products, including Amazon Bedrock, a large language model that allows its clients to build their own generative AI applications. In the second quarter, Amazon's net sales increased by 10% year over year to $148 billion. AWS net sales grew by a much stronger 18.7% year over year to $26.3 billion, partly thanks to the continued adoption of AI. Amazon has also launched AI features for its customers across its other segments, including a shopping assistant called Rufus and an AI-powered playlist generator for Amazon Music customers called Maestro.\n\nTherein lies one of Amazon's greatest strengths: The company isn't just an AI play. Its business is diversified across e-commerce and online advertising, cloud computing, video streaming, music streaming, and grocery shopping. Amazon generates enough cash to pursue brand-new opportunities. The company has tried to break into healthcare for years -- I wouldn't bet against it succeeding. Is Amazon's valuation prohibitively high? AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) for the consumer discretionary industry is 22.9. Still, in my view, Amazon is worth the premium, given its multiple growth opportunities and wide moat from several sources, including the network effect, high switching costs, and a strong brand name. Amazon is one of the best companies to profit from the AI boom, and there are many other reasons to buy the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Fiverr\n\nCompanies will increasingly need AI experts to avoid getting left behind by their competitors, but many don't have the budget to hire an entire team of specialists.\n\nThat's where Fiverr comes in. The company's platform allows businesses to find talented freelancers and contractors across a range of technical industries. An increased demand for AI-related jobs could help lift the company despite the fear that AI could replace many of the professionals on its platform and, thus, have a negative impact on its business. But Fiverr believes that AI's impact has been, and continues to be, a net positive.\n\nTrue, Fiverr's top-line growth and share price have declined in the past few years as its pandemic-related boom came to a screeching halt. FVRR Chart\n\nHowever, as CEO Micha Kaufman argues, \"We are in the early innings of unleashing the full potential of AI in our marketplace, and we believe it'll be a multiyear tailwind for us to drive product innovation and growth.\" Fiverr won't rely solely on AI, either. The gig economy, which it helps power, is gaining in prominence. And the more people turn to freelance work, the more popular the platform will become since it offers a convenient method for businesses and freelancers to find one another.\n\nFiverr's network effect should play a role, too. The more that companies use its website to link with talented contractors, the more attractive it becomes to other freelancers. And although there are competing platforms, they can coexist. It only makes sense to advertise one's skills on multiple mediums. FVRR PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nFurther, Fiverr recently acquired AutoDS, a dropshipping specialist, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction expands Fiverr's addressable market in addition to the growing gig economy. Lastly, Fiverr's shares look reasonably valued.\n\nThe stock could provide superior returns to patient returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Plug Power Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "content": "Plug Power(NASDAQ: PLUG) was considered a promising play on the nascent hydrogen fuel cell market when it went public in 1999. But today, it trades nearly 99% below its initial public offering (IPO) price. Many of its investors retreated after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000; its growth cooled off; and it struggled with accounting issues from 2018 to 2020.\n\nThat was a devastating drawdown for Plug's long-term investors, but its stock now trades at just two times this year's sales. Let's review its business model and see if it's the right time to buy, sell, or hold this out-of-favor hydrogen stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUnderstanding Plug Power's business\n\nPlug Power generates most of its revenue from its hydrogen-infrastructure solutions and GenDrive hydrogen fuel cell systems. Its two largest customers are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which both install its hydrogen fuel cells in their forklifts and other ground equipment to reduce their long-term fuel costs.\n\nPlug has already deployed over 69,000 fuel cell systems and 250 fueling stations across the world, and it's the world's largest single buyer of liquid hydrogen. It also develops stationary hydrogen-grid solutions and sells modular-hydrogen generators, liquefaction systems, hydrogen-storage solutions, and transportation equipment.\n\nWhat challenges does Plug Power face?\n\nPlug Power's biggest challenge has been the sluggish adoption of hydrogen power as an alternative to fossil fuels or battery-powered electric systems. It costs more to produce hydrogen than oil or natural gas, and hydrogen-charging stations are much more expensive to construct than grid-based electric-charging stations.\n\nThat's why Plug pivoted from its original plan to develop hydrogen-powered residential systems toward forklifts for warehouses and fulfillment centers. But to lock in Amazon and Walmart as its major customers, Plug actually subsidized its fuel cell sales to the two retailers with stock warrants -- or options to buy more of its shares at a discount.\n\nThat agreement turned Amazon and Walmart into Plug's major investors, but it also caused accounting issues when the costs of those incentives eclipsed its customer payments. Plug didn't properly disclose the losses from those incentives, so it had to go back and restate all its financials at the end of 2020 for the previous three years. Following those restatements, its reported annual revenue actually turned negative in 2020.\n\nHow fast is Plug Power growing?\n\nPlug's revenue finally grew again from 2021 to 2023, but most of that growth was driven by two acquisitions which expanded its cryogenic-equipment segment. That inorganic growth offset the softness of its core hydrogen fuel cell business, which struggled as the macroheadwinds curbed the market's appetite for new hydrogen-charging projects. But the costs of buying and integrating those new businesses caused its operating and net losses to widen.\n\nStory continues\n\nMetric 2021 2022 2023 1H 2024 Revenue $502 million $701 million $891 million $264 million Operating Margin (87%) (97%) (151%) (191%) Net Income (Loss) ($460 million) ($724 million) ($1.37 billion) ($558 million)\n\nData source: Plug Power.\n\nPlug's revenue declined 44% year over year in the first half of 2024 as those headwinds persisted, but it expects its electrolyzer, cryogenic, and material-handling segments to all expand and stabilize its growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, the company expects its revenue to come in between a 7% decline and 4% growth. Analysts anticipate a 5% decline to $847 million as it narrows its net loss to $893 million.\n\nBut from 2023 to 2026, they expect Plug Power's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26% to $1.77 billion as it narrows its annual net loss to $336 million. Plug only had $62 million in cash and equivalents at the end of  2024's Q2, but it recently secured a new $1.66 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to build up to six new green hydrogen energy production facilities.\n\nHowever, that loan will also nearly double its liabilities to $3.45 billion and boost its debt-to-equity ratio to nearly 1.2. Plug also notably increased its number of outstanding shares by 270% over the past five years with its secondary offerings, warrants, and stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nThat ongoing dilution, rising debt, and red ink could all make it an unappealing stock to own in this high interest rate environment. That's probably why 26% of its shares were still being shorted at the end of July.\n\nIs it time to buy, sell, or hold Plug Power's stock?\n\nPlug Power's stock looks cheap, and its DOE loan should keep its business alive for at least a few more years, but there aren't any compelling reasons to buy or hold its stock right now. It relies too heavily on Amazon and Walmart; it's trying to boost its sales with margin-crushing acquisitions; and it hasn't proven its business model is sustainable. So for now, I'd definitely sell or avoid Plug Power until it addresses those long-term concerns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Plug Power right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Plug Power, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Plug Power wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Meta and Amazon",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 19, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\n\nThe Best of the Magnificent 7: NVDA, META, AMZN\n\nLast week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week’s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\n\nLooking back to last week’s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market.\n\nCan Stocks Continue to Rally?\n\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don’t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\n\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying.\n\nThe economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\n\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, if we don’t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\n\nMETA, AMZN and NVDA Boast Incredible Earnings Growth\n\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\n\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\n\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\n\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\n\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Walmart, Amazon and Target are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 19, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN and Target TGT.\n\nWalmart Earnings & Consumer Spending Trends: A Closer Look\n\nThe combination of Walmart’s beat-and-raise quarterly release and the positive July Retail Sales report has forced the gloom-and-doom narrative that threatened to take center stage just a few days ago into retreat.\n\nThe clouds have not fully lifted yet, though, and downside risks still remain. But for now, at least, the soft-landing narrative is back in the ascendant, which has done wonders for market sentiment. Also helping market sentiment is further evidence from the July CPI reading that reassured investors on the inflation question.\n\nEven before the July CPI report, many in the market had already realized that the Fed’s priority had shifted from price stability to full employment. A rate cut at the central bank’s September meeting is now a given, with the magnitude of the cut as the only point of uncertainty. A bigger-than-normal cut will be seen as a sign of concern from the Fed about the growth outlook.\n\nSome in the market discount the significance of the robust Walmart earnings report as a helpful read-through on consumer spending trends and the state of household finances. Walmart’s strong results for the May through July period and upgraded guidance for the current and coming periods provides further evidence of the economy’s resilience in the face of many challenges.\n\nWalmart is no longer simply a big box retailer as it has a growing digital footprint that has proved to be a worthy competitor to Amazon. The company has been gaining market share for a while now by attracting higher-income households to its convenient delivery and pick-up services.\n\nWalmart has captured a bigger market share due to its digital investments, which has also made its website a desirable advertising destination. Such advertising revenues are higher margin for Walmart, just as they are for Amazon. Management talked about use cases of artificial intelligence in the digital business, further evidence that this is no longer the old Walmart.\n\nTarget, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday, August 21st, has some reassuring read-throughs from the Walmart report, particularly management’s commentary about stability and favorable trends in non-essential merchandise.\n\nA big difference between Walmart and Target is the weightage of groceries and other essentials in the business mix, which accounts for about two-thirds of Walmart’s revenues. Target is more weighted towards non-essentials, with groceries accounting for about a third of the total. Households have been spending less on such discretionary categories as furniture, apparel, and others in the post-Covid world, which has been problematic for Target and others.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart noted improvements in some of the non-grocery merchandise on its earnings call, which will likely be confirmed in the Target report as well.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 26 retailers account for 89.2% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\n\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazonand restaurant players. The 26 Zacks retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce, restaurant industries, and some of the conventional retailers, such as Walmart, which have reported already.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +19.3% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 57.7% beating EPS estimates and only 42.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about this and other headwinds on the Q2 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 16th, we have seen Q2 results from 464 S&P 500 members, or 92.8% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8.3% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and only 59.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have already seen results from more than 92% of S&P 500 members. This week brings in results from over 100 companies, including 14 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include, besides the aforementioned, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s, TJX Companies, Urban Outfitters, and others.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59.5% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.5% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% growth rate in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.2% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.2% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July.\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The most significant cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while those for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.1% on +1.7% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -10.8% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.6%.\n\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.1% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Estimates Face Pressure: What to Know?\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "2 Magnificent S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks Down 20% to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "It can be hard to find a good dividend stock when the broader market's yield is a miserly 1.3%. But you can do it if you are willing to look hard enough. One good place to start is with stocks that are underperforming, such as Archer-Daniels Midland(NYSE: ADM) and UPS(NYSE: UPS). Both have historically high yields today.\n\nArcher-Daniels Midland is getting back to normal\n\nArcher-Daniels Midland, usually just referred to by its ticker ADM, has a dividend yield of 3.4% today. That's more than twice the level of the S&P 500 index and, notably, well above the stock's 10-year average yield of about 2.7%. The reason for the elevated yield is, as the chart below shows, because of a significant decline in the stock price. This year alone, ADM is down more than 18%. ADM Chart\n\nThe good news is that ADM has a huge business processing and handling agricultural commodities. It is an entrenched industry giant with a $28 billion market cap. Since it's an integral part of the global food chain, its business is, basically, a necessity. And, given its size and reach, it would be difficult to replace ADM's operations, affording it something of a protected position in the market.\n\nThe bad news is that ADM's market is commodity-driven and, thus, its top and bottom lines can vary greatly from year to year. The stock is down today because commodity prices are retreating from a huge post-coronavirus pandemic peak. Investors are reacting to the exaggerated commodity swing by selling the stock, even though the business is really just getting back to a more normal level.\n\nIn fact, if you think in decades and not days, ADM's entrenched industry position means its business remains well positioned for success. Notably, the company has increased its dividend for roughly five decades, suggesting that it is still a reliable dividend stock.\n\nGiven the historically high yield, down and out Archer-Daniels Midland is worth a closer look for investors who want to buy and hold good companies for the long term.\n\nUPS is trying to take off again\n\nUPS's dividend yield is about 5.1%. That's about four times the yield on the S&P 500 index. The yield is also notably above the roughly 3.1% 10-year average yield for the stock. Like ADM, the reason for the historically high yield is a dramatic stock pullback, as the chart below highlights. The year-to-date drop is nearly 18%. UPS Chart\n\nThe good news is that UPS is one of the two largest package delivery services in the U.S. (it has a market cap of more than $110 billion), and it has an entrenched industry position globally, as well. Its logistic network, which includes a vast collection of sorting warehouses, airplanes, and trucks, would be hard to replicate. And while Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has increasingly built out its distribution capacities, it still makes extensive use of UPS's services. For now, Amazon is more of a partner than a threat. In fact, this relationship shows how hard it would be to simply cut UPS out of the package delivery picture.\n\nThe bad news is that UPS's business got a little bloated and, while Amazon hasn't displaced the company, its internal distribution efforts have been a small headwind. UPS has reacted by working to slim down while refocusing around its best market niches, like medical-related deliveries. The effort has been a bit rocky, with second-quarter 2024 earnings coming in weaker than investors expected on both the top and bottom lines. But the volume of packages UPS handled turned higher after a string of declines after the coronavirus pandemic demand peak. So the quarterly update wasn't all bad.\n\nGiven the roughly 15-year streak of annual dividend increases here and the generous yield, long-term investors should probably take a glass-half-full approach to the stock. It's the kind of entrenched industry giant you'll be happy to buy and hold for decades.\n\nEvery company goes through hard times\n\nNo business rises in a straight line -- they all zig and zag with good times followed by bad times and vice versa. Often the best time to buy a stock is when it is experiencing a little hardship, which is the case for both ADM and UPS right now. But the key for each is that they have enormous businesses that would be difficult to replace, affording each long-term staying power. In time, both are likely to muddle through the current hardships while continuing to reward dividend investors that are willing to ride out a little short-term uncertainty.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Archer-Daniels-Midland right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Archer-Daniels-Midland, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Archer-Daniels-Midland wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT)",
        "content": "Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) stock has soared 150% during the last year to crush Meta, Amazon, Apple, and tons of other tech standouts. Spotify stock looks ready to break out to new all-time highs, even as SPOT’s valuation improves immensely.\n\nSpotify’s commitment to efficiency and profits, mixed with a string of price hikes and strong user growth are leading to booming earnings expansion and impressive revenue growth.\n\nThe streaming music powerhouse posted another blowout beat-and-raise quarter in late July that sent Spotify’s earnings outlook soaring even higher.\n\nSpotify Stock’s Bull Case\n\nSpotify was one of the pioneers of paid streaming music. The company forever altered the music industry the way Netflix changed TV and movies. Like Netflix (NFLX), Spotify’s success inspired challengers such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet to enter the streaming music space.\n\nDespite competition from the giants of tech, Spotify remains the king of streaming music. Spotify reportedly held 32% of the global streaming music market share in 2023, blowing away No. 2 Apple (AAPL) Music’s 15%, as well as YouTube’s (GOOGL) 14% and Amazon’s (AMZN) 13%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is thriving as users flock to the service for music, podcasts, and more recently, audiobooks. SPOT nearly doubled its revenue between 2019 and 2023. Spotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 80% between Q2 FY20 and Q2 FY24, while monthly active users surged 110%.\n\nSpotify is projected to grow its monthly active users by roughly 45% to 900 million by 2028, based on some Wall Street estimates. Spotify’s user growth expansion is key to helping it continue to negotiate favorable rights deals with artists.\n\nSpotify’s streaming service often becomes an essential aspect of its users’ daily lives, helping SPOT successfully raise its prices in back-to-back summers. Spotify in the summer of 2023 hiked its monthly prices for its ad-free Premium plans to match competitors such as Apple and Amazon. Fast forward to June 2024, and SPOT upped its prices again to help keep up with inflation and boost profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHigher interest rates sparked Spotify to focus on efficiency and the bottom line, much like Amazon and other former sales and user growth-over-everything-else tech firms. Spotify has cut down its workforce and rolled out other streamlining efforts.\n\nSpotify appears to have reached an inflection point on profits and cash flow growth.\n\nSpotify’s Recent Quarter and Growth Outlook\n\nSpotify boosted its gross margin by 510 bps to a record high of 29.2% in the second quarter. SPOT expanded its free cash flow to €490 million in Q2, up from €207 in the first quarter of 2024 and just €9 million in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify grew its monthly active users by 14% YoY in the second quarter to 626 million, expanding its paid Premium Subscribers by 12% to 246 million. Spotify grew its revenue by 18% last quarter and swung from an adjusted loss of -$1.69 a share in the year-ago period to +$1.43, crushing our EPS estimate by 32%.\n\nSpotify boosted its outlook once again as its combination of price hikes, efficiency, and user growth lead to soaring earnings expansion. SPOT’s FY24 EPS estimate has surged 27% since its Q2 release, with its FY25 figure 21% higher.\n\nSPOT’s recent bottom-line revisions are part of an impressive trend that’s seen its FY24 EPS estimate skyrocket 940% over the last 12 months from $0.61 a share to its current $6.32, while its FY25 figure soared 280%. Spotify’s improving EPS estimates help SPOT stock land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$6.32 per share in 2024 and then surge 38% next year to $8.70 a share. Meanwhile, Zacks estimates call for SPOT to grow its revenue by 19% in 2024 and another 15% next year to climb from $14.33 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in FY25—doubling revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify expects to end the third quarter with 639 million monthly active users, marking 11% YoY growth.\n\nBreaking Down SPOT’s Performance, Technical Levels, and Valuation\n\nSpotify stock has soared 350% off its 2022 lows (around the stock market’s 2022 bottom), including an 80% YTD climb. SPOT crushed Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet during both of those periods. Despite its impressive run, Spotify trades around 8% below its 2021 peaks and 9% under its average Zacks price target.\n\nSpotify stock might be ready to finally break out to new all-time highs if it can build on its first-half momentum in terms of earnings expansion and beyond. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSPOT’s 21-day moving average has provided rather bullish support since the start of 2023. Spotify stock is also far from overheated, with it sitting at neutral levels in terms of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (bottom part of the nearby chart)—RSI is used to help determine if a stock or index is too expensive or too cheap based on its recent performance.\n\nSpotify trades at a 75% discount to its 12-month highs at 42.9X forward 12-month earnings. SPOT’s PEG ratio, which factors in the company’s long-term earnings growth outlook, marks a 60% discount to the Tech sector. In terms of forward sales, Spotify stock trades at a 43% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 41% vs. SPOT’s highs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTime to Buy Spotify Stock?\n\nSpotify forever reshaped the music industry as much as Netflix permanently changed Hollywood. SPOT’s valuation is improving as its profits boom. Now appears to be a good time to think about buying Spotify stock as SPOT attempts to reach new heights.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "You can't go a day without hearing or reading about Nvidia. The company powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution now has the third-largest market cap in the world at over $2.8 trillion. Investors are betting big on its continued growth, valuing the stock at a premium price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 63 at the moment.\n\nOptimism is high, but I think it is time to zig while others are zagging. Here are two stocks with lower market caps than Nvidia that I think will surpass it by 2030.\n\nAlphabet: The true AI winner?\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the fourth largest company in the world by market cap, one slot behind Nvidia. With Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud, it has dominated the consumer internet landscape for most of the 21st century. It leads the digital advertising space as billions of users around the world regularly engage with Google and YouTube.\n\nLast quarter, Google Search revenue grew 14% year over year, YouTube advertising revenue rose 13%, and Google Cloud revenue was up 29%. This impressive growth across the board drove the company's operating income to an all-time high of $98 billion over the last 12 months. This is significantly higher than Nvidia, which generated less than $50 billion in operating earnings.\n\nInvestors might have been scared to invest in Alphabet due to the narrative that it was falling behind in AI. In late 2022, OpenAI debuted ChatGPT for the masses and then received a huge investment from Microsoft. For a short while, it looked like Alphabet was losing the race in new conversational and creative AI tools.\n\nToday, it has shown an ability to copy and even surpass all of OpenAI's innovations, which should give investors comfort. It looks like Google and Alphabet overall are now leading in AI.\n\nThere is still plenty of room to grow as internet use increases around the world and cloud computing gains more market share. And there's the potential of these new AI tools, which it is embedding in its new devices like its Pixel phones. With higher earnings today and a long runway to grow, I think the company has a great chance to have a larger market cap than Nvidia by 2030. GOOG Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon: More of the same\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is sixth on the list of largest companies in the world with a market cap of $1.8 trillion. Dominating e-commerce and cloud computing has allowed it to keep growing even at such a large size.\n\nOver the last 12 months, revenue has hit $600 billion, up from around $100 billion 10 years ago. And it shows no signs of slowing down, with revenue increasing 10% year over year last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nProfitability has always been a concern with Amazon, but new CEO Andy Jassy has assuaged these worries. Its operating margin has jumped to an all-time high of 9% over the last 12 months and 10% last quarter. With the growth of higher-margin advertising, subscription, and third-party e-commerce services, it should only see consolidated profit margins rise.\n\nCompared to Nvidia -- which already has sky-high margins -- Amazon can increase earnings at an impressive clip by expanding its underlying profit margin while also growing sales.\n\nIt already generates more in operating income than Nvidia. Assuming it can hit $1 trillion in revenue by 2030 and 15% operating margins, Amazon's operating income will jump to $150 billion by the end of this decade. If this happens, I think it will have a larger market cap than Nvidia in 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "You already know that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the stock market's most rewarding tickers this century. Although shares stumbled a bit during the dot-com meltdown following its 1997 initial public offering (IPO), they're now up more than 220,000% from their IPO price.\n\nBut how many shares would you own today if you had purchased only one share then? After all, it's split several times since the company's May 1997 public offering.\n\nAmazon's stock split (and price growth) history\n\nAmazon stock has undergone four stock splits since its IPO, for the record. The first of these was a 2-for-1 split in June of 1998. The next one -- a 3-for-1 split -- took shape less than a year later. The stock split yet again on a 2-for-1 basis in the latter half of 1999.\n\nThen, the company held off on stock splits for quite some time, choosing to let shares appreciate in step with Amazon's growth.\n\nHowever, once its price moved and stayed well above $3,000 beginning in late 2020, the company couldn't hold out any longer. In an effort to make it more accessible to more investors, Amazon stock underwent a 20-for-1 split in June of 2022.\n\nAll told, one share of Amazon purchased right at its IPO would be 240 shares today. On a split-adjusted basis, its IPO price of $18.00 per share has been pared down to only $0.075. As of the most recent look, the stock's still trading at over $166 per share, for perspective.\n\nOther young companies will do the same\n\nOf course, few investors were wise enough to step into this then-risky e-commerce outfit right at its IPO and then stick with it this whole time.\n\nA few folks have done so, however, testifying to the power of being patient with a position in a young company with lots of potential. There will be other Amazon-like growth companies in the future. You just need to identify them as early as possible.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Is Buying Tons of This Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, and It Might Surprise You",
        "content": "Famed growth investor Cathie Wood loves to invest in disruptive tech stocks, and investors love to see what's on her investing plate. Sometimes, it's her tried-and-true picks like Tesla and Teladoc Health, and sometimes it's an under-the-radar initial public offering (IPO) stock like Tempus AI.\n\nOne stock you don't usually see in Ark Invest's picks is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). But Cathie Wood's investment firm was buying shares last week like they were going out of style. Let's see why Amazon might be looking attractive to her right now.\n\nIt's all about artificial intelligence\n\nThis isn't the first time Cathie Wood has bought Amazon stock. She's held it for years in several of her exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Her recent typical picks are the riskier, highly disruptive type, but Amazon caught her attention last week.\n\nUnder founder Jess Bezos' leadership, Amazon developed a mandate that it calls \"Day 1.\" It still uses this phrase frequently as a guiding force in how it approaches growth and innovation, as if each day it's starting anew. You can see this in its culture everywhere, and recently, AI has been driving its growth opportunities.\n\nToday, e-commerce and cloud storage, which are Amazon's main businesses, are so mainstream that they wouldn't catch Wood's attention. But AI is a peak disruptive force, making Amazon an attractive bet even for Wood.\n\nCurrent CEO Andy Jassy said that the AI business is growing \"dramatically\" and already had a multibillion-dollar run rate. Its position as the largest cloud-computing company gives it an incomparable data set that it's probing to create the highest standards in AI, and its clients are telling it that they want more flexibility at a competitive price point. Even though it works with companies like Nvidia right now for AI chips, Amazon is also building its own with these factors at play.\n\nThis is translating into practical services for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers. Jassy said that over the past 18 months, \"AWS has launched more than twice as many machine learning and generative AI features into general availability than all of the other major cloud providers combined.\" He added that it's far from finished.\n\nAmazon just got a lot cheaper\n\nWhat smart investors usually get right is timing. I don't mean to say that you can time the market, because you can't. But savvy investors wait for opportunities and buy stocks on dips, at bargain prices, and when they're out of market favor. Many investors are scared to buy those kinds of stocks. Intuitively, it makes sense to buy stocks that the market likes. But stocks that are already well-liked by the market almost by definition have already achieved strong gains, and the best stocks are often the counterintuitive buys, as long as you're OK with some risk.\n\nCathie Wood isn't known for her love of undervalued stocks like Warren Buffett is, but it seems that she couldn't let go of the opportunity to buy Amazon stock as it plunged after earnings. Not only did she buy Amazon stock, she bought it on all five trading days last week, and she bought it for six of Ark Invest's eight ETFs.\n\nAmazon stock tanked after its second-quarter report, due mainly to two things: a slight miss on revenue expectations and sales guidance below the analyst consensus average. It's since started to climb again, but it remains 9% down since the earnings update.\n\nArk has finished its buying spree, at least for the time being. Is it too late to buy? Maybe Cathie Wood got Amazon for a steal, but it still looks like a bargain. It's trading near its lowest valuation in 10 years and well below recent averages. AMZN PE Ratio data by YCharts\n\nIn other words, having the option to buy Amazon stock at this valuation is a rare treat. I focused on AI here, because that's what Cathie Wood is likely seeing in this opportunity. But Amazon has tons of opportunities in e-commerce, advertising, streaming, healthcare, and more, and it's not too late to buy this standout stock at bargain-basement prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 2 Incredible Growth Stocks Are Set to Soar This Summer and Beyond",
        "content": "Many stocks have been enjoying major gains as the bull market has persisted, driving up shares prices of companies across various indexes. If you're investing for the long term, what's more important is how a stock can perform over the long run versus a period of weeks or months.\n\nWhile past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns, investing your cash into great companies well-positioned for long-term growth is always a good idea. If you have cash on hand this summer and want to put it into quality companies that can soar in the coming months and years, here are two worthy contenders to consider for your portfolio.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) is known for its leadership in the field of cystic fibrosis therapeutics but is working to expand beyond this area and further cement its place in the rare-disease drug market. The company's flagship cystic fibrosis therapy Trikafta is approved to treat more than 90% of the U.S. patient population alone. Expanded approvals for Trikafta and Vertex's other cystic fibrosis drugs have helped the company to expand the cycle of use for patients, deepening its foothold in this broad total-addressable market.\n\nThe company has a new triple-combination cystic fibrosis therapy for which it's seeking regulatory approval. Among numerous benefits, it only needs to be taken once a day instead of twice a day, like Vertex's current lineup of medicines.\n\nThe triple-combination therapy has been granted priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Vertex is seeking approval for eligible cystic fibrosis patients aged six and older. Management also estimates that as many as 6,000 patients who have discontinued the company's existing cystic fibrosis therapies may be eligible to take this new triple-combination drug.\n\nVertex's launch of CRISPR therapy Casgevy is in full swing. The gene editing therapy is designed to be a one-time functional cure for patients with sickle cell disease, as well as transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, a condition that impairs the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. In the recent earnings call, management affirmed that Casgevy's existing approvals face a total addressable market of 35,000 individuals in the U.S. and Europe, along with around 23,000 patients in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe company's acute pain candidate suzetrigine is awaiting the regulatory green light from the FDA,and has also been granted priority review by the agency. The total addressable market for this product, which is not an opioid, could be upward of 90 million patients in the U.S. alone.\n\nVertex is working on numerous functional cures for various diseases that are either underserved and/or have extensive, fragmented addressable markets. Take its stem cell therapy VX-880, for example, which is being tested as a functional cure for type 1 diabetes.\n\nAt a presentation for the American Diabetes Association in June, Vertex Pharmaceuticals reported that VX-880 showed significant promise in an ongoing phase 1/2 study. The presentation focused on 12 patients from the study who had received a full dose via a single infusion of the therapy and had at least three months of follow up.\n\nFrom this group, 11 of 12 patients significantly reduced or eliminated exogenous insulin use, all 12 patients had time in range for glucose levels of 70% or more, and all 12 patients reached hemoglobin A1c levels less than 7%. Three of these patients received 12 months of follow-up, and all three of these individuals met the primary endpoint of eliminating severe hypoglycemic events with a hemoglobin-A1C level below 7 -- the secondary endpoint of insulin independence. The next development phase for VX-880 is in progress.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Vertex is profitable and revenue is steadily rising. The 2024 second quarter was a rare exception, when it reported a net loss because of a one-time nondeductible $4.4 billion research and development charge related to its acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences.\n\nRevenue rose 6% year over year in the second quarter of 2024 to $2.65 billion. Vertex also finished the quarter with more than $10 billion of cash and investments on its balance sheet, despite having used about $5 billion in cash to fund its Alpine acquisition. Overall, this is a healthcare business in solid shape that seems to have a superior growth opportunity again, and investors might want to consider an investment sooner rather than later.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has demonstrated its resilience through many types of stock markets and economic landscapes. Looking at the second quarter of 2024, the company reported $148 billion in net sales, a nice 10% bump from the prior-year's quarter. Of that total, sales were a healthy split between about $62 billion in product sales and $86 billion in services sales. Net income totaled $13.5 billion, about double the 2023 second-quarter profit.\n\nAmazon's flagship e-commerce platform and Amazon Web Services (AWS) continue to be the most notable needle movers for the company's financial growth. However, other areas, like subscription services and advertising, are growing steadily, too.\n\nCase in point: Amazon brought in $55.4 billion in net sales from online stores and about $36.2 billion from third-party seller services in the latest quarter. Those figures represented increases of 5% and 12%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nAWS accounted for $26.3 billion of net revenue, with that figure representing a 19% growth rate from one year ago.\n\nAdvertising sales were the next largest revenue driver and totaled $12.8 billion, up 20% year over year. Subscription services, like Prime, raked in net sales of $10.9 billion, a 10% increase from a year ago.\n\nFrom a profitability perspective, AWS is the leading driver. Of Amazon's total operating income of $14.7 billion in the latest quarter, $9.3 billion was attributable to AWS.\n\nThe company continues to expand its pharmacy division. One recent update was that Prime members on Medicare can now receive unlimited access to 60 widely used prescription medicines for a mere $5 per month.\n\nAmazon is also expanding in artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI tools that integrate with its AWS platform -- like its model builder SageMaker, GenAI assistant Q, and Amazon Bedrock -- are being used by organizations of all sizes across a variety of industries. Amazon has also launched AI features for consumers, such as a shopping assistant called Rufus for U.S. mobile customers.\n\nAmazon's mixture of revenue sources from both products, as well as services, continues to drive steady profitability, cash flow, and sales growth. This still looks like a fantastic business in which investors can park some capital for the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Stock Market Sell-Off: 3 Stocks to Buy Now Before It Recovers",
        "content": "After a slight market sell-off, plenty of companies look like great deals. Most of the news causing this decline will be irrelevant in three to five years, so there's no reason to panic.\n\nAt the top of my shopping list today are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). All three companies have fantastic long-term tailwinds and look like strong buys right now.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semi is probably the most critical company in the world. Without its manufacturing capabilities, companies like Apple, Nvidia, and almost every other company that depends on high-tech devices would be out of luck. Its best-in-class semiconductor manufacturing capabilities allow it to produce cutting-edge chips in the 3nm marketing category.\n\nThese specialized production techniques require unbelievable knowledge and skill to be implemented at a large scale, so unseating TSMC is nearly impossible, although there are still worthy competitors out there.\n\nRight now, the stock is about 10% off its 2024 highs, but it's still worth a buy even though investors have missed the true bottom. At 26 times forward earnings, it still isn't expensive for the growth it's putting up.\n\nIn the second quarter, revenue grew 33% in U.S. dollars while providing solid guidance for the third quarter (32% revenue growth). Taiwan Semi is well-positioned to benefit from the steady increase of technology in our lives. If investors have the chance to buy the stock on sale, they should take the opportunity.\n\nAlphabet\n\nEven without the sell-off, Alphabet looked like a prime buying opportunity. Despite being one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet doesn't earn a premium valuation like its peers. The parent company of Google, YouTube, and the Android operating system only carries a price tag of 22 times earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nConsidering that its peers have valuations of 30 times forward earnings or greater, Alphabet looks like one of the cheapest big tech stocks. And its cheapness isn't associated with its business performance, because Alphabet has been crushing it.\n\nIn Q2, Alphabet's revenue rose 14% year over year and increased its operating margin by three percentage points. Google Cloud, in particular, had a great quarter, with revenue rising 29%. This is a critical division, and strong results show that it is still a top pick in the cloud computing space.\n\nAlphabet is a dominant company that doesn't have the premium that its peers carry. This is an excellent opportunity to scoop up shares for a fantastic price.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon\n\nIn some investors' eyes, Amazon may be doing the worst out of these three. In Q2, sales only rose 10% to $148 billion, but investors wanted more. The company also issued guidance for 8% to 11% revenue growth for Q3, which also didn't please the crowd.\n\nHowever, that's the wrong figure to be looking at. Amazon isn't going to provide lightning-fast growth due to its sheer size. Instead, I'd point investors to how profitable Amazon is becoming. Amazon offers operating income guidance, which is projected to come in between $11.5 billion and $15 billion in the next quarter, compared to $11.2 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nUnless operating income comes in on the very bottom end of management's guidance, that will provide excellent earnings growth, which is critical in bringing down Amazon's valuation. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n36 times forward earnings isn't necessarily cheap, but getting Amazon to maximum profitability in one year also isn't a realistic expectation. Amazon's long-term trajectory is to grow its earnings much faster than revenue as it works to increase profitability across the board.\n\nThis is my primary investment thesis in Amazon, and it will take years to play out. If investors focus on revenue growth and are selling off the stock as a result, then that provides a cheaper buying price for me.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

However, a new trend sees people turning to social media, especially TikTok, for investment tips from ‘finfluencers,' raising concerns about the reliability of their advice.\n\nWhat Happened: A report from BestBrokers found that over 64% of the stock predictions made in the 20 most-watched stock-picking videos on TikTok in 2023 turned out to be accurate, including significant rallies in AI stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NADSAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\n“Our findings show that over 64% of the 87 total stock predictions in these videos came out accurate, including the remarkable rallies of AI stocks such as Nvidia and Qualcomm,” the BestBrokers report said.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) similar to traditional financial experts' advice for lower-risk investments.\n\nExperts interviewed by CNBC, such as Gerald Wong of Beansprout and Jeremy Tan of Tiger Fund Management, expressed skepticism about the reliability of these finfluencers. They noted the broader U.S. stock market performed well during the study period, which may have influenced the results.\n\nJiang Zhang of First Plus Asset Management highlighted concerns about the unregulated nature of these influencers and potential conflicts of interest.

        "title": "If I Could Only Invest In 1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Over the Next Decade, This Would Be It",
        "content": "Over the last year, investors have turned to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in search of outsized gains, and for good reason.\n\nMega-cap tech companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have all outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite over the last 12 months. Much of these gains can be attributed to a rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI), a market dominated by the Magnificent Seven.\n\nYet despite the impressive performances of the companies above, I see another member of the Magnificent Seven as a superior choice for long-term investors.\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has underperformed the Nasdaq over the last year and has basically generated returns in line with those of the S&P 500.\n\nWith shares down roughly 14% over the last month, I think now is a prime opportunity to buy the dip in Amazon.\n\nLet's dig into how Amazon is quietly disrupting the AI landscape and assess why now looks like a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares at a dirt-cheap valuation.\n\nDon't call it a comeback\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities surrounding AI is cloud computing. Amazon faces fierce competition in the cloud infrastructure market from Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n\nOver the last 18 months or so, Microsoft has swiftly augmented the Azure platform thanks to the company's $10 billion investment in OpenAI -- the developer of ChatGPT. Moreover, Alphabet has done a respectable job of breaking into the cloud realm thanks to a series of acquisitions, including MobiledgeX, Forseeti, Siemplify, and Mandiant.\n\nThese moves by Microsoft and Alphabet initially appeared to be taking a toll on Amazon's cloud revenue growth and its profitability. However, the table below illustrates some newfound encouraging trends from Amazon's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nCategory Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 AWS Revenue Year over Year % Growth 16% 12% 12% 13% 17% 19% AWS Operating Income Year over Year % Growth (26%) (8%) 30% 39% 83% 72%\n\nData source: Investor Relations\n\nThe figures above showcase a really positive narrative for Amazon. Over the last year, AWS has transitioned from a business experiencing consistent deceleration to one that has now grown in three consecutive quarters, all while significantly increasing operating income. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is a money-printing machine\n\nSeeing a return to revenue and profit growth is nice to see, but it's only one part of the greater story for Amazon. Image source: Investor Relations.\n\nThe majority of Amazon's operating profits stem from AWS. For this reason, the reacceleration of the cloud business has directly impacted Amazon's overall cash flow profile. For the quarter ended June 30, Amazon generated $53 billion of free cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis. Furthermore, with a balance sheet boasting $86 billion of cash and equivalents, Amazon has virtually no shortage to invest aggressively and give its rivals a run for their money.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the catalysts sparking renewed growth in AWS is Amazon's $4 billion investment in generative AI start-up Anthropic.\n\nThis relationship is particularly important because Anthropic is training its AI models on Amazon's in-house semiconductor chips -- Trainium and Inferentia. This provides Amazon with a direct line to compete against Nvidia as demand for semiconductor chips continues to boom.\n\nMoreover, the company is also investing $11 billion into a data center project in Indiana. To me, these investments solidify Amazon's ambitions to compete all across the AI landscape as AWS enters a new phase of its evolution.\n\nFor those reasons, I think the revenue growth and renewed profits from AWS, as shown above, are only the beginning.\n\nA prime valuation for investors\n\nAmazon currently trades at a price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple of 37.1, which is less than half its 10-year average. I find this peculiar, considering that Amazon is a much larger and far more sophisticated business today than it was a decade ago. AMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nTo me, investors are either overlooking or unappreciative of Amazon's dive into the AI realm. I think AI's future potential may be baked into some of Amazon's Magnificent Seven compatriots, given that many of them have handily outperformed the markets over the last year.\n\nBy contrast, Amazon is already reaping the rewards from these AI-driven initiatives, and the company has a boatload of cash to keep funding the growth for quite some time. For these reasons, I think Amazon is the most lucrative opportunity among mega-cap tech stocks right now. In my eyes, this is an excellent opportunity to buy Amazon stock hand over fist.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) is placing a bet on Ulta Beauty (ULTA).\n\nOn Wednesday, the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed in a regulatory filing that it bought 690,106 shares in the beauty retailer in the second quarter, worth roughly $266 million as of the end of June. Ulta stock jumped over 11% on Thursday and continued to rally on Friday, up 14.6% since Berkshire disclosed its holdings.\n\nThe move is \"a big stamp of approval,\" BMO Capital Markets managing director and senior analyst Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance. \"The beauty category has always been an attractive category.\"\n\nIn addition to taking a stake in Ulta, Berkshire Hathaway added aerospace manufacturing company Heico (HEI) to its holdings and exited its positions in Snowflake (SNOW) and Paramount (PARA). Berkshire also trimmed shares of Apple (AAPL), among other names.\n\nHowever, Berkshire's stake in Ulta came as a surprise. The stock has had a tough year so far, though, which may have made it more attractive, in line with Buffett's value-oriented investment philosophy. Shares of the retailer are down 23% since the beginning of the year.\n\n“Warren Buffett is almost like the original value investor, and I think that that’s the way they looked at it,” said Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba, who has a Buy rating on Ulta stock. \"We do like the fact that Berkshire got involved with the stock. It definitely lends credibility to the story.\"\n\nUlta's slowdown concerns\n\nUlta is one of the largest beauty retailers in the US and is set to expand into Mexico in 2025. In its most recent quarter, the company increased sales by 3.5% year over year to $2.7 billion, continuing a trend of strong growth and overall resilience in the beauty industry.\n\nHowever, on April 2, Ulta Beauty CEO Dave Kimbell warned investors of \"a slowdown in the total category across price points and segments.\"\n\nThat spurred a sell-off in the stock, reflecting investors' fears about a downturn in sales and increased competition from Sephora and Amazon (AMZN), particularly in the higher-end beauty segment.\n\nAccording to Chukumba, those concerns seem \"overblown.\"\n\n\"Ulta has a great model,\" he continued. \"They have a completely debt-free balance sheet. They generate a ton of free cash flow. They buy back stock pretty aggressively. I think they're going to initiate a dividend later this year, which will open up the stock to income investors as well.\" Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett attends the Berkshire Hathaway Inc annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3, 2024. (REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nSiegel questioned whether Ulta is a healthy but more mature business or if it's saturated and is no longer able to sustain its growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Ulta and Sephora have revolutionized the way [the] consumer shops beauty the last 15 years,\" Siegel said. \"The business has dramatically taken ... share away from department stores in favor of the specialty beauty retailers, which are predominantly Ulta and Sephora. They've done a phenomenal job.\"\n\nHowever, \"Ulta has now pivoted or has now cycled into the next leg of its maturity,\" Siegel continued. \"It's no longer growing at the same level that it was growing.\"\n\nHe added that it will be up to management to prove to shareholders that it can still grow. StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nIn May, CEO Kimbell told shareholders, \"I remain confident in our differentiated model, the resilience of the beauty category, and our ability to execute against our plans, but we have adjusted our annual guidance as we anticipate the dynamics we faced in the first quarter to continue for the balance of the year.”\n\nKimbell announced that the company will share more details at its investor day in October about its plan to drive long-term share growth.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth",
        "content": "There are always at least some great stocks to buy at any given time. Finding stocks to buy and hold for the ultra-long haul, however, can be a different story. The underlying companies should be leaders of industries that are perpetually in demand. These organizations also need to be capable of adapting as needed to changes in the marketplace, whether those changes be technological leaps, evolving consumer preferences, or new competition.\n\nNot too many companies fit this particular bill. However, there are a few names of this ilk that can be bought and held for a generation (or more), building more and more wealth the longer you and your heirs own them. Here's a closer look at three of your best bets among these tickers.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThere's no denying that Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) highest-growth days are in the past. The e-commerce market is mostly mature, and its competition is finally figuring out how to be, well, competitive.\n\nIt's not like this company doesn't have a strong second act lined up, though. In fact, it's got a couple of compelling growth engines revving already.\n\nOne of these engines is, of course, cloud computing.\n\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) only accounts for less than one-fifth of the company's revenue, this arm drives nearly two-thirds of its operating income. It's still growing in a big way, too. Through the first half of the year, AWS' top line is up 18%, and there's much more of the same in store. Market research outfit Mordor Intelligence suggests the global cloud computing market is set to grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nThe other key growth driver to be excited about is Amazon's advertising business.\n\nYou already know Amazon was launched as an e-commerce outfit, making little to no profit in its early days in exchange for the eventual dominance of the online shopping market it enjoys now. eMarketer reports that Amazon's share of the United States' retail market is on the order of 40%. It's increasingly monetizing the massive amount of web traffic Amazon.com draws, too.\n\nBut it's doing it in a different way. In addition to earning a small fee on its third-party sellers' sales or turning a small profit on sales of its own goods, Amazon now also collects money from third-party sellers that wish to prominently feature their products at the site. It did nearly $12.8 billion worth of this high-margin ad business during the second quarter alone, up 20% year over year.\n\nNeither of these business models are particularly complicated or impossible for a rival to replicate. Both operations are capable of growing indefinitely, though, and Amazon already dominates each one. It's already the market leader of both, and Amazon is positioned to capture at least its fair share of each market's future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. PepsiCo\n\nCoca-Cola is the typical go-to name for investors looking to add a dividend-paying consumer goods stock to their portfolio -- and understandably so. Almost everyone is familiar with its brands, and the company's not only paid a dividend like clockwork for decades, it has raised its annual dividend payments every year for the past 62 years. Nice.\n\nCoca-Cola isn't actually your best income-driving bet from the beverage arena, however. That honor belongs to rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). While it's only raised its annual dividend in each of the past 52 years, it's been raising it at a much faster clip than its archrival. KO Dividend Chart\n\nThat's not PepsiCo stock's only difference from Coca-Cola. In contrast with Coca-Cola's more modest stock buybacks, PepsiCo's outstanding share count has fallen at a considerably faster pace than its rival's has over the course of the past 20 years. KO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) Chart\n\nA more aggressive stock-repurchase program is obviously a key reason PepsiCo's dividend growth has outpaced Coca-Cola's. Nevertheless, PepsiCo has demonstrated an ability and willingness to bolster its shareholders' net value to a degree Coke simply hasn't.\n\nThis will never be a high-growth name, to be clear. But slow and steady wins the race. The key to creating generational wealth with PepsiCo is buying it and then reinvesting its dividend payments in more shares of the stock. This slow accumulation of shares consistently accelerates your overall net growth the whole time you're holding this often-overlooked consumer staples name.\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nFinally, add Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) to your list of stocks that could create lasting generational wealth.\n\nIt's not a stock in the traditional sense. Rather, Berkshire is a basket of stocks hand-picked by Warren Buffett and his lieutenants. From this perspective, it's not unlike a mutual fund.\n\nEven that comparison somehow doesn't do it justice. A stake in Berkshire Hathaway is in many ways a means of letting Buffett manage your money for you based on his proven, value-minded approach to picking stocks. You need to be willing to make the same long-term commitment he is to a particular business. If you're truly generationally minded, that's no problem.\n\nThat being said, Warren Buffett's stock-picking prowess still isn't the top reason you might want to own Berkshire for the long haul.\n\nAlthough it's rarely discussed, the majority of Berkshire Hathaway's value doesn't come from the stocks it's holding. As of the latest look, only about one-third of Berkshire's market cap of more than $900 billion reflects the sum total of all its equity investments.\n\nThe remainder reflects the value of all the wholly owned private companies that also help make up the conglomerate. These include battery company Duracell, underwear brand Fruit of the Loom, insurer Geico, flooring outfit Shaw Industries, and railroad BNSF, just to name a few. These are cash-generating businesses that arguably fare better in the long run by not being publicly traded, allowing them to sidestep misguided influence from short-term-minded shareholders.\n\nThat's what Berkshire Hathaway's performance suggests, anyway. Although it can lag the S&P 500 from time to time, in the long run, it reliably beats the overall market. That's why it's another one of those names you'll just want to buy and then leave alone for years on end, trusting in the underlying premise of the investment itself. Just remember that -- unlike PepsiCo -- there are no dividend payments to reinvest here. It's all capital appreciation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Amid the Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks have been some of the biggest drivers of the bull market since the end of 2022. Unfortunately, they've also been some of the biggest loss-makers amid the recent market sell-off.\n\nNot every AI-fueled company will generate lasting wealth for investors. Some stocks may continue lower over the long run. But buying the best of the best companies with sustainable competitive advantages across multiple areas should produce excellent returns for shareholders. And if you can buy them on a dip in the share price, as we've seen recently, you'll do even better.\n\nHere are three no-brainer artificial intelligence stocks to buy amid the current market sell-off. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the leading public cloud provider, an essential resource for AI training and development. While the growth of AI has opened the door for competing hyperscale cloud providers such as Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to win new customers, Amazon has been able to hold its own. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, grew revenue 19% in the most recent quarter, helping it maintain its leadership position.\n\nBut Amazon is much more than a cloud computing company. Its the dominant force in e-commerce. Its Prime membership creates a virtuous cycle for online sales. As more customers sign up, it bring more merchants into the marketplace using Amazon's fulfillment network to access Prime shipping. That gives Amazon more money to invest in logistics, enabling faster shipping speeds, increasing the attractiveness of Prime. Amazon delivered more than 5 billion items to customers' doorsteps same day or next day during the first six months of the year.\n\nAmazon's also the third largest digital advertising company in the world. It surpassed a $50 billion run rate in the second quarter, growing 20% year over year. That high-margin revenue has become a significant source of profit for the company as the retail business maintains very slim margins.\n\nAmazon goes through cycles of investments and scaling to capitalize on its investments. Every cycle results in more and more free cash flow generation. The most recent efforts have paid off with $53 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. Even with its investments in AI, Amazon is poised to keep growing cash flow for some time as it pulls back on fulfillment center spending. Shares currently trade near a 10-year high free cash flow yield, making them attractive at this price.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is the fastest-growing hyperscale cloud provider, but its 29% growth last quarter in Azure, its cloud platform, still managed to disappoint Wall Street's high expectations. The sell-off could be a great opportunity for long-term investors. That's because despite its strong growth over the past few years, management expects Azure revenue to accelerate in the second half of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has been investing heavily in AI. Since adding $10 billion to its investment in OpenAI in early 2023, Microsoft has spent billions building out data centers and buying the chips necessary to outfit its servers. But while those capital expenditures hit upfront, it takes time for Microsoft to deploy all those chips and get its servers up and running and ready for Azure customers. As additional capacity comes online, Microsoft expects it won't have any problems finding demand.\n\nMicrosoft has become a top source for AI-focused developers, and its own consumer and enterprise-facing AI services, which it brands Copilot, have also found good traction. Management says its Copilot customer base increased 60% sequentially last quarter. Considering there are more than 400 million Office 365 customers, there's a long runway for growth, too.\n\nMicrosoft stock isn't cheap by a valuation standard. Its enterprise value is over 10 times analysts' sales estimates for next year. Its forward P/E of nearly 31 is well above the S&P 500 average, not to mention its own historic valuation over the past 15 years. But Microsoft is growing faster than it has in a long time and it has a long runway of growth ahead of it, justifying the premium valuation.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is well known for its creative software suite featuring designer staples like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom. Last year, the company introduced new generative AI features powered by its Firefly model. Firefly was trained on Adobe's proprietary data, including its stock image library. Firefly features include generative fill and generative expand in Photoshop, text to vector in Illustrator, and remove object in Lightroom.\n\nThese new features have helped Adobe attract and retain users over the past year. What's more, it's managing to push free users of Adobe Express to sign up for its paid subscription, and paid subscribers to pay more for greater access to AI features. The result is a return to growth in its core metric, annualized recurring revenue. ARR exceeded analysts' expectations last quarter coming in at $487 million, and management provided strong guidance for the current quarter.\n\nAdobe's looking to repeat its performance in the creative suite with its Document Cloud (Acrobat) and its marketing platform. New AI tools help automate and generate output for users, which could drive increased subscriptions and higher subscription revenue per user in the future.\n\nWhile generative AI has enabled multiple new creative design tools to enter the market, Adobe benefits from a strong network effect as the industry standard. Any designer looking for work needs to be well versed in Adobe's software, and any company looking for design work needs access to Adobe's tools as well. That creates a virtuous cycle that will make it hard to unseat Adobe.\n\nAdobe shares currently trade at an enterprise value-to-revenue ratio around 11, below its 10-year average. Likewise, its forward PE around 27 is below its historic average and very attractive considering its growth prospects. That makes it a great stock to buy amid a sell-off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. warned Flex drivers who deliver packages in their own vehicles that payments they were supposed to receive Thursday “may be delayed,” stirring panic among workers accustomed to prompt payment after completing a route.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nThe initial Amazon message doesn’t explain the problem or say when it could be resolved, adding to the concerns.\n\n“We’re contacting you because your payment scheduled for 15 August 2024 may be delayed,” said messages sent to multiple Flex drivers. “We are actively working on this issue and will let you know when it’s resolved. You don’t need to take any action.”\n\nIn an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said a “technical issue” caused the delay that affected some Flex drivers. “We’re informing impacted delivery partners that all outstanding payments are expected to be disbursed by Monday,” he said. “We apologize for the inconvenience and delay.”\n\nFlex drivers took to social media forums such as Facebook and Reddit to discuss the matter. One driver, who asked not to be identified due to fear of retaliation from Amazon, said in an interview that drivers were especially worried about potentially having to wait until Monday.\n\nAmazon’s package delivery operation includes Flex drivers who accept routes through a smartphone app and deliver packages in their own vehicles, not unlike how Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. contractors use those platforms to pick up riders. A major appeal of the job is the flexibility of not having fixed hours and also getting paid quickly after completing an assignment, unlike most jobs that have weekly or biweekly pay schedules.\n\n(Updated with Amazon statement in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Walmart Earnings &amp; Consumer Spending Trends: A Closer Look",
        "content": "The combination of Walmart’s WMT beat-and-raise quarterly release and the positive July Retail Sales report has forced the gloom-and-doom narrative that threatened to take center stage just a few days ago into retreat.\n\nThe clouds have not fully lifted yet, though, and downside risks still remain. But for now, at least, the soft-landing narrative is back in the ascendant, which has done wonders for market sentiment. Also helping market sentiment is further evidence from the July CPI reading that reassured investors on the inflation question.\n\nEven before the July CPI report, many in the market had already realized that the Fed’s priority had shifted from price stability to full employment. A rate cut at the central bank’s September meeting is now a given, with the magnitude of the cut as the only point of uncertainty. A bigger-than-normal cut will be seen as a sign of concern from the Fed about the growth outlook.\n\nSome in the market discount the significance of the robust Walmart earnings report as a helpful read-through on consumer spending trends and the state of household finances. Walmart’s strong results for the May through July period and upgraded guidance for the current and coming periods provides further evidence of the economy’s resilience in the face of many challenges.\n\nWalmart is no longer simply a big box retailer as it has a growing digital footprint that has proved to be a worthy competitor to Amazon AMZN. The company has been gaining market share for a while now by attracting higher-income households to its convenient delivery and pick-up services.\n\nWalmart has captured a bigger market share due to its digital investments, which has also made its website a desirable advertising destination. Such advertising revenues are higher margin for Walmart, just as they are for Amazon. Management talked about use cases of artificial intelligence in the digital business, further evidence that this is no longer the old Walmart.\n\nTarget TGT, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday, August 21st, has some reassuring read-throughs from the Walmart report, particularly management’s commentary about stability and favorable trends in non-essential merchandise.\n\nA big difference between Walmart and Target is the weightage of groceries and other essentials in the business mix, which accounts for about two-thirds of Walmart’s revenues. Target is more weighted towards non-essentials, with groceries accounting for about a third of the total. Households have been spending less on such discretionary categories as furniture, apparel, and others in the post-Covid world, which has been problematic for Target and others.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart noted improvements in some of the non-grocery merchandise on its earnings call, which will likely be confirmed in the Target report as well.\n\nTarget shares have been big-time laggards this year, as the chart below shows. The year-to-date performance chart below shows Target (red line: up +0.8% YTD) relative to the S&P 500 index (green line: up +16.2%), Amazon (orange line: up +16.7%), and Walmart (blue line: up +39.4%). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 26 retailers account for 89.2% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\n\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce, restaurant industries, and some of the conventional retailers, such as Walmart, which have reported already.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +19.3% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 57.7% beating EPS estimates and only 42.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about this and other headwinds on the Q2 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 16th, we have seen Q2 results from 464 S&P 500 members, or 92.8% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8.3% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and only 59.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have already seen results from more than 92% of S&P 500 members. This week brings in results from over 100 companies, including 14 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include, besides the aforementioned, Target, Lowe’s, Macy’s, TJX Companies, Urban Outfitters, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59.5% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.5% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% growth rate in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.2% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.2% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The most significant cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while those for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.1% on +1.7% revenue growth.

        "title": "The worst performing investment funds so far this year",
        "content": "Investors have over £53bn across funds that have consistently underperformed, with managers with low or zero exposure to AI-themed stocks and the energy sector lagging.\n\nGlobal equity funds were the most prominent offenders in Bestinvest’s latest ‘Spot the Dog’ report, with 44 funds making the list, a slight improvement from 51 earlier in the year. A third of these global funds are focused on sustainable investing, missing out on gains from the surge in oil and gas stocks.\n\nUK equity funds also featured prominently, with 44 funds flagged, a significant increase from 12 a year ago. Ethical and sustainable funds make up about a quarter of these underperformers, largely due to their lack of exposure to the UK's energy and commodities sectors.\n\nThe report found 137 equity investment funds holding £53.42bn consistently underperformed. You can read the full list here.\n\nThe number of ‘dog funds’ has dropped by 9% since the start of the year, when 151 funds made the list. However, it remains significantly higher than the 56 funds flagged only a year ago.\n\nThe value of assets tied up in these underachieving funds has also fallen sharply, dropping to £53.42 billion—44% less than the £95.26bn reported in the previous edition, primarily due to a few large funds narrowly avoiding the list.\n\nRead more: Where to invest your money when interest rates are falling\n\nTo make it into the list, a fund must have underperformed compared to the market it invests in by 5% or more over a three-year period.\n\nA second filter is that the fund must also have underperformed in three successive 12-month periods in a row.\n\nFund performance can falter for various reasons, ranging from poor decision-making to investment strategies falling out of favour with current market trends. This issue is particularly pressing as investors question why so many funds continue to lag behind their benchmarks, especially given the recent boom in AI, which has invigorated the US stock market and global equities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the rally has been driven by a narrow group of US megacap companies benefiting from AI, making it challenging for fund managers who lack exposure to these few giants to keep up.\n\nThe AI-driven surge in select stocks fails to capture the broader equity market's struggles over the past three years. A notable trend, consistent with previous reports, is the high representation of ESG and ethical funds among the underperformers. These funds account for a fifth of the Spot the Dog list, reflecting the unexpected rise in oil and gas prices due to post-pandemic supply chain issues and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRead more: Investors flock to tech funds amid AI race\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, said: “The high number of sustainable or responsible funds in the latest Spot the Dog report partly reflects the strong performance of oil and gas stocks in 2021-22. Over the three-year period covered, the MSCI World Energy Index delivered a total return of 98% in GBP, compared to the MSCI World Index's 28%. Conversely, the alternative and renewable energy market has struggled, with the MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index declining by 38% over the same period.”\n\nHollands anticipates a reduction in ESG funds on the list in future reports as the impact of surging energy stocks fades. He also noted the dominance of companies like NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT)—dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\"—which have driven market performance recently. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index has surged 42% over the past year, with these companies now making up a significant portion of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and MSCI World indices.\n\nRead more: Best UK savings accounts offering above inflation rates\n\nThe previous edition of the report included two of Britain's most prominent funds—Terry Smith's Fundsmith Equity and Nick Train's WS Lindsell Train UK Equity—but both have now dropped off the list. Despite this, the presence of large funds remains a concern, with ten funds over £1 billion in size accounting for £26.81bn, or half of the assets in underperforming funds.\n\nHollands said: “The Spot the Dog report is a timely reminder for investors to regularly review their portfolios. While the report highlights underperforming funds, it also stresses the importance of monitoring investments and considering whether changes are needed.\n\n\"Identifying whether a fund is struggling due to short-term challenges or more deep-rooted issues is crucial for investors deciding whether to hold or sell.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Nvidia’s earnings could turn around the ailing AI trade",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence trade has been losing its luster as of late. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), three of AI’s biggest players, are down over the last month, with Google parent Alphabet dropping 14%, Amazon off about 8%, and Microsoft falling more than 7% as of Thursday.\n\nThe stock moves come after the companies, along with fellow hyperscaler Meta (META), confirmed they’ll continue to pour billions of dollars into building out their AI infrastructure over the coming quarters — without providing much insight into when they’re going to turn all of that spending into revenue. That, along with the recent market turmoil, has put a damper on AI company stocks.\n\nBut the most important component of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA), still has to report its earnings. The chip company’s performance could turn around the AI trade more than any hyperscaler. Unlike those software firms, revenue hasn’t been a problem for Nvidia. Still, if it falls short of Wall Street’s already sky-high expectations, it could bring the AI trend down with it.\n\nNvidia’s huge year-over-year gains won’t last forever\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft’s AI spending might be giving investors pause, but it’s helping pad Nvidia’s bottom line. The company’s Hopper AI chips are the most sought-after on the market, and the firm is set to begin ramping up production of its Blackwell line later this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company controls 80% to 95% of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters. That means every time a company says it's spending on AI capabilities, chances are it’s buying up, or at least using, Nvidia’s processors.\n\nBut Nvidia’s second quarter report also marks the start of what will be several quarters of difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons. The company’s fiscal Q2 2024 revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 101% year over year. Data center revenue topped $10.3 billion, up 141%.\n\nEach subsequent quarter has seen ever more impressive year-over-year gains for the chip giant. But that party won’t last forever. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $26 billion, a 262% increase from the $7.19 billion the company reported in the prior year.\n\nFor its upcoming second quarter report, Wall Street analysts are anticipating revenue of $28.6 billion, a 112% year-over-year jump. And while that still represents an enormous increase in revenue, it’s not as staggering as the growth the company has seen in its previous quarters. And that could turn off some investors.\n\nNvidia is still the AI trade’s bright spot\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia isn’t expected to continue raking in cash, or that Wall Street is down on the company. As of Thursday, 66 analysts had Buy ratings on Nvidia’s stock. Just seven had Hold ratings and only one had a Sell rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s safe to say Wall Street has confidence in the company’s outlook. After all, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri pointed out in a recent investor note, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC, which produces Nvidia’s chips, posted strong quarter-over-quarter results in its high-performance computing segment. That should indicate another potentially stellar quarter for Nvidia is in the offing.\n\nNvidia, unlike software companies, also benefits from the fact that its products have a real tangible benefit for its customers now. Hyperscalers are putting the company’s chips to work as fast as they can to develop and power AI models. But AI-powered software is still in a foggy kind of testing phase. Companies are implementing AI enterprise software, but it’s not as though its impact on their employees’ productivity will skyrocket overnight.\n\nWhat’s more, experts say it’ll still take years for AI-powered software like Microsoft’s Copilot or Google’s Gemini to truly pay off for business customers. And while those companies are busy iterating on their products, Nvidia will keep on selling them its hardware.\n\nSo, while the AI trade may have taken a hit over the last month, its biggest winner will continue powering forward.

        "title": "The Best of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, META, AMZN)",
        "content": "Last week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week’s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\n\nLooking back to last week’s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nCan Stocks Continue to Rally?\n\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don’t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\n\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying. The economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\n\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\n\nThus, if we don’t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\n\nStory continues EquityClcck\n\nImage Source: EquityClcck\n\nMETA, AMZN and NVDA Boast Incredible Earnings Growth\n\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\n\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\n\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\n\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\n\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks.

        "content": "The Nasdaq and tech stocks are poised for significant gains heading into year-end, driven by the accelerating AI revolution, according to a recent note from Wedbush analysts.\n\n\"[The] stage [is] set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end with [the] AI revolution,\" said the firm.\n\nDespite market volatility, growth concerns, and other macroeconomic challenges, Wedbush believes that the tech sector is on the brink of substantial growth, underpinned by the expanding influence of AI.\n\nWedbush highlighted that while there were some \"soft spots\" in recent tech earnings, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s weaker e-commerce guidance and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube ad revenue dip, the overall earnings season was \"generally robust.\"\n\nThis performance, the analysts argue, \"further solidifies the AI tidal wave of spending is coming to the shores of the rest of the tech world.\"\n\nThe firm emphasized the foundational role of cloud and AI technologies in the ongoing \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nThey state that companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google, and Amazon have demonstrated \"rock solid\" underlying cloud strength, with more enterprises expected to adopt cloud and AI solutions in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nWedbush believes key players like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) have also shown significant AI momentum, further validating this trend.\n\nWedbush also sees Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s upcoming earnings report on August 28th as a critical moment for tech investors. Describing Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang as the \"Godfather of AI,\" they anticipate his insights will showcase the \"massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025.\"\n\nWedbush believes the current AI revolution is akin to the early days of the internet, marking the beginning of a transformative era for tech stocks rather than a speculative bubble. They remain bullish on the sector heading into 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStage is set for Nasdaq, tech stocks to move higher: Wedbush\n\nExclusive-Deutsche Bank's proposed Postbank case settlement offer rejected by plaintiffs\n\nEvergrande onshore unit's administrator seeks details from creditors ahead of meeting\n\nView comments",

        "title": "TJX Companies' Upside Is Limited Due to High Valuation",
        "content": "TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) has historically delivered solid returns for shareholders. The stock has delivered a total return of roughly 68% over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 26% over the same period. The move higher has been driven by strong earnings growth and investor enthusiasm for the company's international expansion plans.\n\nCurrently, the stock trades at roughly 27 times forward earnings per share, which represents a significant premium to the broader market, a premium to other discount retailers and a valuation which is in line with some of the highest-quality businesses in the world. While it may be able to maintain current levels, I view significant upside as limited due to the stock's high valuation.\n\nCompany overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with TJX. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows\n\nTJX Companies is a leading discount retailer with over 4,900 locations across nine countries. The company operates stores under a number of different brand, names including TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, HomeGoods, Winners and others. While the company generates most of its sales in the U.S., international markets include Canada, Australia, Germany, the U.K., Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nThe company generally offers a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise at prices 20% to 60% below full-price retailers. The company is able to achieve these prices by deploying an opportunistic buying merchandising strategy that allows it to acquire goods at lower prices than other retailers. TJX Companies embraces the fact its merchandise tends to change frequently and offers consumers a treasure hunt-type shopping experience. Despite operating in a highly competitive industry, the company has been able to generate solid results and has generated a return on capital well above its cost of capital. TJX Companies' Upside Is Limited Due to High Valuation\n\nRetail is a tough business, but TJX is well positioned\n\nWhile TJX Companies has been able to deliver strong results historically, the fact remains the company operates in a very difficult industry. The retail business is highly competitive and the company faces competition from other physical and online retailers. Key competitors include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), JC Penney (JCPNQ), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and many others. In addition to being highly competitive, the retail business is fairly capital intensive due to the need for retailers to hold inventory. Finally, the retail business is also challenging because consumer tastes and preferences rapidly evolve.\n\nInvesting guru Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) summed up the challenges that retailers face in his 1995 shareholder letter:\n\n\"Retailing is a tough business. During my investment career, I have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth and superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly nosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy. This shooting-star phenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in manufacturing or service businesses. In part, this is because a retailer must stay smart, day after day. Your competitor is always copying and then topping whatever you do. Shoppers are meanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of new merchants. In retailing, to coast is to fail.\"\n\nAs a result of these factors, a number of leading U.S.-based retailers have gone out of business despite having a very strong market position for long periods of time. Notable retail failures include Sears, Lord & Taylor, Bed Bath & Beyond, Toys R Us, Circuit City and many others.\n\nTJX Companies is well positioned in that, thus far, it has been mostly immune to the threat posed by Amazon and other online retailers. Consumers continue to value the treasure hunt shopping experience and TJX's prices tend to be very competitive with Amazon. On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Ernie Herman responded to a question regarding new competition from Temu and Shien:\n\n\"On the question about some of those online players you were talking about, we feel just as similar -- they're so commodity-driven and so not the brands that we would carry very much not the good, better, best type of branded mix that we would go after. We see very little issue with them taking market share from us. I could see that their business model could overlap with some other brick-and-mortar guys or some other online guys for sure. But we just don't see that as bumping up with our customer base or end use.\"\n\nValuation comparisons\n\nCurrently, TJX Companies trades at roughly 27 times forward earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at around 22 times forward earnings per share. Thus, the company is currently trading at a significant premium to the broader market. Moreover, it is trading at a valuation which is fairly close to some of the highest-quality stocks in the market, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which trade at 29 and 31 times forward earnings.\n\nWhile Apple and Microsoft represent vastly different businesses than TJX Companies, they represent a valuable yardstick as to what a reasonable valuation is for a very high-quality business. Given the fact the company competes in a highly competitive business, I believe there is a solid case to be made that it should trade at a significant discount to these stalwarts.\n\nConsensus estimates currently call for TJX Companies to report earnings per share growth rates of 7% for fiscal year 2025, 10% for 2026 and 13% for 2027. Comparably, the S&P 500 is expected to deliver earnings growth of roughly 11% for 2024 and 14% for 2025. Thus, on a relative basis, TJX Companies' valuation premium does not appear to be warranted versus the broader market based on earnings growth prospects.\n\nIn addition to trading at a premium to the broader market, TJX Companies is also trading at a premium relative to its peers. Ross Stores, which is arguably its closest competitor, trades at 23 times forward earnings per share and has near-term growth prospects that are similar to TJX. Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), another comparable discount retailer, trades around 32 times forward earnings, but is expected to experience faster near-term earnings growth. Consensus estimates call for Burlington Stores to report annual earnings per share growth of roughly 27%, 23% and 23% over the next three years. Walmart, which is somewhat different due to its larger scale, focus on grocery and strong online retail presence, trades at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nAnother reasonable comparison is dollar stores given their focus on discount retail. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) trade at 16.50 and 14.30 times forward earnings. While Dollar General has near-term growth prospects which are similar to TJX Companies, Dollar Tree has arguably better growth prospects and is expected to grow earnings per share by 12.70%, 18.50% and 13.90% over the next three years.\n\nTJX Companies is also trading at a premium to its own historical median valuation based on key metrics such as forward price-earnings ratio. Historically, the stock has traded at a median price-earnings ratio of 22. Taken together, I view the stock's valuation re-rating potential as more skewed toward the downside as a reasonable case can be made that the stock should trade closer to 23 times forward earnings, which would put it more in line with its closest peer. Using dollar store stock valuations as a guidepost would suggest TJX Companies could trade at a mid-teens multiple. On the other hand, I do not see much of a case for the stock to trade at even a modestly higher valuation than is currently the case as that would put the stock's valuation at a premium to Walmart and in-line with technology stalwarts Apple and Microsoft.\n\nHow TJX could grow into its current valuation\n\nWhile TJX Companies is currently trading at a high valuation, the stock could return to more reasonable levels if it is able to deliver better-than-expected earnings growth over the next few years. The company has ambitious plans and believes it can grow its total store count to more than 6,200 locations over the long term. Moreover, the company has potential to gain market share from other brick-and-mortar retailers which are closing stores. Macy's (NYSE:M) has announced plans to close 150 stores over the next few years and it would not be surprising to see other department stores follow suit.\n\nExpansion into new international markets also has potential to be a major growth driver. In early June, TJX Companies announced plans to form a joint venture with Grupo Axo. As part of the proposed transaction, which is expected to close later this year, TJX Companies would become a 49% owner of Axo's existing off-price business in Mexico, which includes more than 200 stores.\n\nAdditional merger and acquisition opportunities could provide another lever for the company to deliver better-than-expected earnings growth. TJX Companies is not a stranger to large-scale deals and acquired one of its largest brands, Marshalls, in 1995. At the time, Marshalls was the second-largest off-price retailer in the U.S. TJX Companies also acquired Winners in 1990.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting M&A opportunity for TJX Companies currently would be to acquire its leading competitor, Ross, which has a market capitalization of $47 billion compared to its market cap of $130 billion. The Ross Stores brand could complement TJX Companies' existing brands well as it tends to focus on the low end of the off-price retail business, while TJX Companies tends to focus more on the middle market. Moreover, a merger with Ross Stores could give TJX better bargaining power with suppliers and create back-end cost synergies that could help improve margins, resulting in better-than-expected earnings growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nTJX Companies has a solid history of delivering strong results for shareholders despite operating in a very challenging industry. The company has provided customers with a unique value proposition, which includes a treasure hunt shopping experience. Unlike many other traditional retailers, TJX has continued to grow despite the secular shift toward online operations.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a significant premium to the broader market and has lower near-term growth prospects. Additionally, the stock trades at a significant premium to its closest competitor. While the company may be able to grow into its current valuation by delivering better-than-expected earnings growth, I believe upside for the stock from current levels is limited due to its high valuation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned -3.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share, indicating a change of +35.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +62.8%. This estimate has changed +2.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 indicates a change of +23.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.53 billion and $703.32 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Rivian has temporarily suspended production of its commercial delivery vans used by retail giant Amazon.com due to a shortage of parts, a spokesperson for the electric vehicle manufacturer said on Friday.\n\nThe production halt is the latest in a series of supply chain challenges for Rivian, which, like other EV makers, has grappled with significant production issues over the past two years due to supplier shortages.\n\nAmazon, Rivian's largest investor with a 16% stake, has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans to be deployed by 2030. Last year, sales to Amazon represented approximately 19% of Rivian's revenue.\n\n\"A part shortage has temporarily impacted our Electric Delivery Van (EDV) production. We expect to recover all missed production,\" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe part shortage would not affect the production of other Rivian vehicles, including its R1S SUV and R1T pickup models.\n\nEarlier this month, Rivian had maintained its production forecast and said that deliveries would be slightly lower in the current quarter after it shut down its factory in April for retooling and modifications.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Institutional investors control 63% of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 7.1%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Amazon.com implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price 47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders 11% of Amazon.com is held by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$1.8t in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 33%.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amazon.com. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amazon.com. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 8.8%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$1.8t, and insiders have US$190b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Schaffner claimed Bayer violated state law by failing to put a cancer warning on Roundup.\n\nRead more: Binance exec insists bitcoin can recover despite 20% drop\n\nThe court ruled that the company could not include the warning in Pennsylvania because of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, which requires nationwide uniformity in pesticide labels.\n\nThe stock had fallen about 49% in the last year and more than 70% since Bayer completed the takeover in 2018 of agriculture company Monsanto, which makes Roundup.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT)\n\nShares in Applied Materials fell over 3% in pre-market trading even as the Santa Clara-based company forecast fourth quarter revenue slightly above Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe pullback appears to be partly a reaction to the sharp rise in the stock earlier in the day, according to Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.\n\n\"Some of the aftermarket pullback is based on how much the stock went up today... the mixed sales report from China and the wide variance in their fourth-quarter forecast,\" Schulman said. \"Some analysts may have been looking for a more robust next-quarter forecast.\"\n\nApplied Materials forecast fourth quarter revenue slightly above Wall Street expectations on Thursday, fuelled by surging demand for its chip-making equipment amid the AI boom.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-powered chips has driven the need for advanced wafer fabrication equipment, essential in chip manufacturing, which is expected to benefit companies like Applied Materials. However, the market's response suggests some lingering caution among investors.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Have $500? 3 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Small-budget investing can pay off in the long run, and even an amount of $500 could be a great place to start. Also, investors who employ dollar-cost averaging (DCA) often have a budget in the $500 range when making periodic purchases.\n\nFortunately, the market offers plenty of reasonably priced options for investors with this kind of budget. It will allow one to not only buy stock in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS), and Realty Income (NYSE: O) but also take advantage of potentially lucrative bargains that could pay off in the long run. Let's take a closer look at this trio of companies.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAdmittedly, investors may have a difficult time perceiving Amazon as \"reasonably priced.\" Most investors struggle to see stocks with a 40 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio as cheap.\n\nHowever, others may see that as cheap considering that the stock rarely trades below 50 times earnings. Also, despite a market cap in the $1.75 trillion range, it offers opportunities for growth that resemble those of much smaller companies.\n\nConsumers know it best for online sales. Still, this is likely the least profitable part of the business. Instead, its cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), accounts for the majority of its operating income.\n\nThe company does not break down the operating income of its other businesses. Nonetheless, its subscription, digital advertising, and third-party seller businesses consistently report double-digit revenue growth, which should bode well for Amazon stock.\n\nIn the first half of the year, revenue of $291 billion rose 11%. Also, keeping the growth of operating expenses in check led to a net income of $24 billion during that period. That's an increase of 141%.\n\nObviously, Amazon will probably not sustain triple-digit income growth long term. Still, its fast-growing business segments and rising income should lead to stock gains over time.\n\n2. Dutch Bros\n\nDutch Bros has found a niche in the fast-growing but highly competitive beverage market. Its Dutch Classics, drinks based on espresso and half and half, have helped make its drive-thru coffee shops popular. Additionally, Dutch Bros offers teas, lemonades, energy drinks, and other choices to draw customers.\n\nFurthermore, it has some distinct advantages over Starbucks. The fact that it's a drive-thru means it does not have the overhead costs of maintaining indoor sitting areas.\n\nMoreover, unlike Starbucks, it is far from reaching a saturation point in the U.S., which likely means it has years of rapid growth ahead. As of June 30, it operated 912 shops in 18 states, an increase of 158 over the previous 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThose shops generated $600 million in revenue in the first half of 2024, rising 34% over the same period in 2023. Although Dutch Bros turned profitable last year, its net income attributable to the company was relatively modest, coming in at $19 million for the first two quarters of 2024.\n\nFor this reason, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is likely a more accurate measure of valuation than the P/E ratio. Currently, Dutch Bros trades at 2.1 times sales, less than the slower-growing Starbucks at 2.3 times sales. This should bode well for Dutch Bros as it continues expanding.\n\n3. Realty Income\n\nRealty Income specializes in leasing single-tenant buildings, typically to well-known, consumer-oriented businesses. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), it pays at least 90% of its net income from operations in dividends in exchange for not being taxed on this income.\n\nThat has led to a monthly dividend that has steadily risen over the last 30 years. At around $3.16 per share annually, it pays a dividend yield of surpassing 5%.\n\nMoreover, these tenants tend to be some of the better-known companies, with Walmart, Planet Fitness, and Wynn Resorts among its clients. This business model has given Realty Income an occupancy rate of nearly 99% for its approximately 15,500 properties.\n\nDespite the struggles in the stock, revenue for the first half of the year was $2.6 billion, up 32%. Most of that gain was due to the Spirit Realty acquisition that closed that year, which increased the company's portfolio by about 15%.\n\nStill, that also means much of its growth was organic, and it helped to boost funds from operations (FFO) income, a measure of a REIT's free cash flow, to $1.7 billion, a 25% increase.\n\nDespite its gains, the stock trades at only about 15 times its FFO income. Such a valuation allows investors to buy a growing stream of income at a reasonable price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Few hedge fund managers have been as all-in on artificial intelligence (AI) as David Tepper. His Appaloosa fund's portfolio has been stacked with AI stocks for quite a while.\n\nHowever, the billionaire investor doesn't appear to be as enamored with AI these days. Tepper slashed his positions in several AI stocks in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTepper's top five AI cuts in Q2\n\nEach of Appaloosa's top five holdings has a major focus on AI. However, Tepper reduced his hedge fund's positions in all of them in Q2.\n\nHe sold 750,000 shares of Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA), decreasing Appaloosa's stake in the Chinese internet company by roughly 6.7%. However, Alibaba remains the hedge fund's largest position, making up around 12.2% of its portfolio.\n\nTepper cut Appaloosa's stake in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) by 9.2% with his sale of 353,000 shares of the e-commerce and cloud services leader. This wasn't enough to bump Amazon from its perch as the second-biggest holding for the hedge fund, though.\n\nThe billionaire investor sold more than 15.6% of his position in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Despite this significant reduction, the tech giant is still Appaloosa's third-largest holding.\n\nAlthough Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) held onto its No. 4 ranking among Appaloosa's biggest positions, the hedge fund owns a lot less of the social media and metaverse company now. Tepper dumped more than 15.6% of Appaloosa's stake in Meta in Q2.\n\nHe also sold 150,000 shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), reducing Appaloosa's stake in the Google parent by more than 7.2%. However, the sale transactions didn't cause Alphabet to lose its spot as the hedge fund's fifth-largest holding.\n\nWhy is Tepper selling these AI stocks?\n\nTepper hasn't stated publicly why he decided to reduce Appaloosa's positions in its top AI stocks. All we can do is speculate about his reasoning.\n\nIt's striking that the hedge fund manager didn't limit his selling to only one or two AI stocks. Tepper reduced Appaloosa's stakes in Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, as well as several other AI stocks.\n\nHe didn't completely throw in the towel on AI stocks, though. For example, Tepper increased his hedge fund's positions in Adobe and ASML Holdings.\n\nPerhaps he was concerned about premium valuations in some cases. However, that can't be true across the board. Alibaba, for example, trades at a low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4. Alphabet and Meta stocks don't look overly expensive based on their price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) multiples. Also, some of the stocks Tepper bought in Q2 have higher valuations than some he sold.\n\nStory continues\n\nMaybe the best guess behind why Tepper slashed his positions in most of these five AI stocks is that he wanted to take some profits off the table. With the exception of Alibaba, all the other top AI stocks in Appaloosa's portfolio were up solidly year to date in Q2.\n\nShould you sell them, too?\n\nEvery investor has their own objectives to consider when buying and selling stocks. Just because a famous investor like Tepper is selling his biggest AI stock holdings doesn't mean you should automatically follow suit.\n\nAlibaba should have great long-term prospects offering AI cloud services in China. It's a similar story for Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft in the U.S., Europe, and other key markets.\n\nMeta is using AI to increase the monetization of its social media apps and could have a big opportunity in the business AI arena. I think that all five of the top AI stocks Tepper sold in Q2 could be attractive picks to buy for many long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Does Jim Cramer Remain Optimistic About Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\n\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\n\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\n\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won’t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\n\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\n\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\n\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\n\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing significant growth, with a 19% year-over-year revenue increase and a 75% jump in operating income last quarter. This success is largely fueled by the strong demand for AI services and the ongoing transition of corporate IT infrastructure to the cloud. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s entry into the healthcare market, particularly through Amazon Pharmacy, is showing promising results, with growing consumer adoption and increasing market share.\n\nDespite a recent dip in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s stock price, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic, consistently rating the stock as a \"buy\" and projecting substantial upside. Recent business developments, including securing NBA media rights and a successful Prime Day event, further support Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s strong growth outlook.\n\nJim Cramer explained that investors are hesitant to buy Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) because they are concerned about the potential threat from Meta. They fear that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might catch up to and even surpass Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This concern is well-founded, as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements could pose a significant challenge to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s market position.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Amazon is testing product search results that don’t show customer review ‘star’ ratings",
        "content": "Amazon is experimenting with removing customer ratings from its product search results page, a test that the retailer says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its vast selection of products.\n\nThe \"limited test\" affects only a small set of products, the company told Fortune on Thursday, and only affects the search results page, with star ratings and review count totals still available on individual product pages.\n\nSome Amazon customers and sellers recently noticed changes to the Amazon website and mobile app that strip away the star rating and review count of the products that appear in search results. In one example on LinkedIn, an Amazon seller posted the product listing results for a search for \"water flosser.\" Previously, the resulting feed of products in the search results would each include a line of information, from left to right, that included a numerical rating from 0 to 5, the same rating displayed in the form of five shaded-in stars, as well as the number of total ratings for a given product.\n\nIn the new experience, all of that rating and review information has been removed from the overall results page, and shoppers need to click through to each listing's product page to view this information.\n\nAmazon is known among its rivals as an online retailer that is constantly testing new features and tweaking formats inside its shopping experience. But the recent change to the search results page has drawn attention because of the impact it could have to shoppers, independent sellers, and big brands alike.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti confirmed to Fortune that the change is indeed a test, rather than the result of a software bug. She did not offer any information about the results of the testing so far, or about how long the company plans to conduct the tests.\n\n\"We're conducting a limited test on a small set of products to refine which product information, including reviews and other attributes, show in search results to make the results more compact so customers can quickly and easily browse a range of product options.\"\n\nBoschetti also stressed that all of the product details, including ratings and reviews, will continue to show up on individual product pages.\n\nOn the surface, it's fair to wonder how much screen space and customer browsing time Amazon is actually saving by eliminating this one line of information. With customers increasingly using smartphones to browse and buy on the web, companies have optimized the mobile versions of their sites and apps for smaller screens.\n\nStory continues\n\nRatings and reviews have long served as one of Amazon's biggest differentiators and advantages, but also a source of exasperation. As Amazon has courted millions of merchants across to the globe to begin selling through its marketplace, some have tried to game the reviews system through tactics ranging from paying shoppers for 5-star reviews to merging a new product onto an existing product's listing so the new merchandise looks like its carrying a high rating.\n\nA few years back, Amazon introduced one-tap ratings that made it easier for \"verified buyers\" to provide feedback on a product without crafting a written review. At least part of the idea behind the initiative was that it might make it harder, or more expensive, for fake reviews to significantly impact a product's overall rating.\n\nMore recently, Amazon has added AI-powered review summaries to product pages to give shoppers a snapshot of customer feedback without having to wade through individual reviews.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCathie Wood’s flagship fund is continuing to face steep losses amid a broader pullback in technology stocks. Wood’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\n\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\n\nCathie Wood Says “Something Is Changing” and the Fed is Now on “High Alert”\n\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a latest video on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a “cathartic” phase and “something is changing.”\n\n“I do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.”\n\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\n“Interest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.”\n\nCathie Wood’s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter. For this article we scanned the fund’s latest portfolio and picked 11 AI stocks it has positions in. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Cathie Wood’s Favorite AI Stock?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nCathie Wood’s Latest Stake Value: $19,170,400\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company’s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\n\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\n\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\n\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\n\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\n\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\n\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nYTD Return as of August 1: 30%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Contrary to public opinion, the company is investing heavily in incorporating AI into the tools it already markets, in line with efforts of competitors like Google and Microsoft. AI tools can improve the user experience on software offerings of these firms, enabling instant responses and pictorial representations of complex queries and prompts. In mid-July, the company announced that it would be adding more memory to so-called virtual agents that automate work for businesses. This would allow users to build on new requests with AI-enabled processing of prior ones.\n\nAndrew Jassy, the CEO of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), said during the second quarter earnings call that the firm had invested in custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The firm has an eye on generative AI as it develops these chips. He added that the second versions of those chips with Trainium coming later this year were very compelling on price performance.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 28th on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Between running billion-dollar businesses and managing hundreds of employees, most chief executives don’t have time for grocery shopping.\n\nBut Whole Foods Market CEO Jason Buechel opts to shop 14 times a week.\n\n“I pretty much am in the grocery store at least twice a day, every single day,” Buechel said in a recent interview with Fortune. The Austin, Texas-based company leader said he visits the 80,000-square-foot flagship store around lunchtime and returns after work to buy fresh ingredients for dinner. The self-proclaimed “foodie” browses the cheeses and checks out the salad bar, often drafting “detailed” shopping lists on an Excel sheet to plan for a specific recipe. Jason Buechel getting lunch from Whole Foods' salad bar.\n\n“I happen to work above one of the best places to eat in Austin,” said Buechel, who became CEO in 2022. He took over the role from iconic founder John Mackey, who held it for 42 years before Buechel stepped in after a nearly year-long transition period. Amazon purchased the organic grocery chain for $13.7 billion in 2017.\n\nThe 46-year-old gave Fortune an exclusive glimpse into his daily routine, consisting of a “minimum of 10 meetings per day,” six-mile runs, and twice-daily trips to Whole Foods Market.\n\nBetween meetings, Buechel noshes on creations from Whole Foods Market’s salad bar and loves to experiment with new recipes from products he picks up around the store.\n\n“I can’t host a party without asking our cheesemongers for their recommendations on putting together an impressive cheese and charcuterie board,” he said. Buechel has a deep affinity for fromage and fresh vegetables. He started gardening at age seven, and both his parents grew up on dairy farms. His father was a cheese maker, Buechel told Harvard Business Review.\n\nBut frequenting Whole Foods Market stores is more than just about sustenance and availing himself of the 20% staff discount for Buechel. He credits it as the key to his business success.\n\nRegular visits to Whole Foods Market stores around the country allow him to connect with the grocer’s team members, learn from their experiences, and gather real-time feedback from customers. Buechel says his shopping strategy helps him understand the business and “grow as a leader”—evident in his recent decision to slash prices to appease inflation-weary shoppers.\n\nBut immersive grocery trips aren’t the only thing that helps Buechel make smart business moves.\n\nSimilar to former Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan, who spent six months as a barista to “immerse” himself in the business, Buechel spends his time working in the stores to understand what’s working at Whole Foods—especially during the busy holiday season.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Whether I'm helping restock produce to bagging groceries, to helping support the pickup of holiday meals, it's always fun to connect with our customers and our team members, and help and work with them,” Buechel said.\n\nThe CEO also told Fortune he trained under a Whole Foods Market butcher to learn how to cut the perfect aged-ribeye steak and tenderloin, and recently graduated from the grocer’s bakery decorator program to understand the basics of icing cakes.\n\n“It’s so important for all of us as leaders.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Billionaire Stocks to Buy From the Latest Stock Market Correction",
        "content": "The market losses in the first three days of August provided a tremendous opportunity for stocks to buy now.\n\nBetween the July 31st close and the August 5th close, the S&P 500 lost 6.1%. At its peak, the index was off 8.5%, putting it on the brink of a correction. On August 2nd, close to $3 trillion was temporarily washed away as investors fretted about a global recession.\n\nThe headlines screamed of billionaires losing billions. According to Fortune, the world’s 500 wealthiest people lost $134 billion on August 2nd, including a $17 billion single-day loss for Elon Musk. Of course, when you still have $235 billion, it’s a little easier to take.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor a little perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos lost $16 billion on August 2nd. Yet, it was only his third-worst loss, with the worst in April 2019 when his divorce settlement redistributed $36 billion to his former wife.\n\nThese three billionaires might have been buying their stock on August 2nd. If you missed buying on the dip, and are focused on holding for the long term, these three billionaire stocks to buy now will make you money over the next three to five years.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, Jeff Bezos recently lost $16 billion, bringing his net worth to $191 billion. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth is just about where it was nearly two weeks ago.\n\nEven better, his net worth is up $13.3 billion in 2024, a mere $37 billion away from catching the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO in first place. Bezos’ gains year-to-date are the 14th best amongst the Bloomberg billionaires.\n\nWhen you consider that Amazon’s five-year gain is nearly 90%, just 180 basis points higher than the S&P 500, I don’t know how you can’t buy at these prices.\n\nAmazon had $232.89 billion in sales and $12.42 billion in operating income in 2018. In 2023, its revenues were $469.82 billion, and its operating income was $36.85 billion. That’s compound annual growth of 15.1% and 24.3%, respectively.\n\nYet, the CAGR for its share price is 15%, considerably less than its operating income. If it’s true that share prices follow profits, AMZN has some catching up to do.\n\nLVMH (LVMH) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBernard Arnault is the CEO and creator of LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY), the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. As a result, Arnault is the world’s third wealthiest person, with a net worth of $184 billion.\n\nHowever, as the 500 wealthiest billionaires go in 2024, he’s lost the most — down $23.8 billion. That would be depressing if Arnault thought in weeks or months. Fortunately, for shareholders, he thinks in years and decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe American Depository Receipt is down over 11% year-to-date and nearly $21 over the past 52 weeks. It now is up just 81% over the past five years, less than the S&P 500.\n\nThe thing I’ve found about LVMH stock over the years is that, like its Louis Vuitton bags, they rarely, if ever, go on sale. This is one of those moments. It’s down 26% from its March 52-week high of $191.63.\n\nAt the end of July, LVMH reported first-half 2024 earnings. The results had more than a few holes. The biggest being a 14% decline in its Asia sales in the second quarter, excluding Japan, on top of a 6% decline in the first quarter. Additionally, LVMH’s net profit declined by 14% in the first six months to 7.27 billion euros ($7.99 billion).\n\nThe good news? Its free cash flow increased 74% to 3.13 billion euros ($3.44 billion), or 7.5% of revenue, 320 basis points higher than a year earlier.\n\nLVMH will be fine, and should be considered one of the stocks to buy.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong. Stocks to Buy Now\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) Chairman Emeritus Leonard Lauder’s net worth has fallen 21% or $4.1 billion in 2024 to $15.8 billion. That’s because Estee Lauder stock has lost 37% year-to-date. It’s now down nearly 49% over the past five years.\n\nEL is the riskiest of the three stocks to buy.\n\nIn February, the company announced a restructuring that would cut up to 5% of its global workforce. Starting in Q3 2024, the cost of the plan was estimated to be between $500 million and $700 million. Once completed, gross profits will increase by between $350 million and $500 million. This will ultimately boost its operating profit to $1.25 billion, up from $900 million.\n\nFashion Dive reported in late July that the initiatives to cut organizational layers at Estee Lauder are underway. Fashion Dive reported Morningstar analyst Dan Su’s comments:\n\n“We believe initiatives to cut organizational layers in value chain management, marketing and channel functions are already underway. In addition, we think the company is in the process of exiting unprofitable brands and channels while carefully managing the impact on the overall company image and important retailer relations.”\n\nEL stock hasn’t traded at this level since May 2017. This is a compelling risk/reward proposition if you’re an aggressive investor.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The U.S. economy is likely expanding significantly, as the Federal Reserve is now predicting that the economy will grow by a strong, seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 2.9% above inflation during the current quarter. Still, the U.S. unemployment rate surged to 4.3% in July — up from 4.1% in June. The savings rate tumbled to 3.4% of after-tax income in June 2024 from 4.8% during the same period a year earlier.\n\nFurther, multiple, major companies, including Disney (NYSE:DIS), Macy’s (NYSE:M), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), are reporting that many consumers are reducing their spending.\n\nIn the current environment, buying food stocks is a good idea, since everyone has to eat in order to live. As a result, many food companies should be more resilient to reduced consumer spending trends than other types of firms that get most of their revenue from consumers. Here are three top food stocks to buy that should deliver strong returns despite the rocky consumer spending environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEl Pollo Loco (LOCO) El Pollo Loco restaurant exterior and sign\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn a smart marketing move that has apparently impressed the Street, El Pollo Loco has hired popular TikTok influencer Yuri Lamasbella to promote its Double Chopped Salads. The marketing campaign featuring the influencer, who has 4.7 million TikTok followers and 3 million Instagram followers, will feature “compelling content creation, mouth-watering food photography and strategic branding” by Lamasbella, El Pollo Loco reported.\n\nI’ve long believed that the company would eventually benefit from its combination of tasty, healthy food, appeal for those like Mexican food, and affordability. Lamasbella’s hiring by El Pollo may finally get many members of Generation Z to try the brand for the first time, and many of them will likely remain loyal to it.\n\nThe firm hired Liz Williams as its CEO in March, and the brand was already performing well under her leadership before Lamasbella’s hiring. Specifically, its systemwide comparable restaurant sales climbed 4.5% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier last quarter while its income from operations advanced to $12.3 million from $10.9 million in Q2 of 2023.\n\nGiven El Pollo’s strong performance last quarter and its hiring of Lamasbella, I view it as one of the best food stocks to buy.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) sells a great deal of food, and the retailer could get a big boost if consumers generally eat more at home and less at restaurants.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, on July 2, investment bank Stifel reported that Costco and Amazon combined accounted for 23% of the growth of the U.S. grocery sector from 2019 to 2023. “The companies benefited from a ‘strong value proposition and convenience,’ along with their spending on loyalty programs and digital offerings,” Stifel wrote. During the period, Costco gained market share from multiple competitors, including drug stores and traditional grocery outlets.\n\nLast month, Costco’s comparable store sales increased by an impressive 5.2% versus July of 2023.\n\nInvestor’s Business Daily gives COST stock a very high Composite Rating of 91 out of 99 and ranks it first in the Retail-Major Discount Chains category. Moreover, the shares have a Relative Strength score of 92, indicating that they have performed very well over the past year.\n\nGiven Costco’s many positive attributes, it is one of the best food stocks to buy.\n\nFreshpet (FRPT) A view of several packages of FreshPet (FRPT) pet food, on display at a local grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, pets have to eat, too, and most pet owners want to give their companions high-quality, healthy food. As a result, Freshpet (NASDAQ:FRPT), which provides “natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats” in the U.S., should continue to post strong financial results even if consumer spending growth markedly slows.\n\nLast quarter, the retailer’s sales soared 28% versus the same period a year earlier while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped to $35.1 million from $9 million in Q2 of 2023. Moreover, the firm increased its full-year sales guidance to at least $965 million from at least $950 million and hiked its adjusted EBITDA outlook to at least $140 million from at least $120 million.\n\nFurther, the company noted that it had penetrated 12.8 million households at the end of Q2, up 2% versus the same period a year earlier. Freshpet believes that its products will be purchased by an impressive 20 million households in 2027.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the firm’s earnings per share to jump to $1.16 next year from 71 cents this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned a long position in AMZN and his wife owned a long position in LOCO.

        "title": "When You Look Back on This Moment in 2030, You Might Wish You'd Bought This Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Wall Street and industry experts are unquestionably bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). Here are just some of the forecasts floating around:\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management predicts AI will add $200 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Consulting firm PwC places that number at a more modest -- but still substantial -- $15.7 trillion by the same year. Goldman Sachs says AI will add around $7 trillion to the global economy over the next 10 years. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said $1 trillion will be spent upgrading data center infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers over the next five years alone.\n\nIf those forecasts come to fruition, I think one company has the potential to benefit more than any other. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a fast-growing presence in AI hardware, large language models (LLMs), and AI software applications through its cloud computing platform. As an added bonus, the tech giant is using AI to enhance its legacy e-commerce business.\n\nWhen 2030 rolls around and investors are reflecting on this moment, here's why they might wish they had bought Amazon stock.\n\nThe three layers of AI\n\nDeveloping AI is complex and expensive, but businesses want the technology to boost productivity and create new revenue opportunities. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest cloud computing platform, and it's becoming a destination of choice for AI developers because of its infrastructure and broad portfolio of AI services.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy refers to hardware as the bottom layer of AI, which includes data centers and the chips within them. Like most cloud providers, AWS uses Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processors (GPUs) in its data centers, but Jassy says developers are constantly demanding better price performance. That's why Amazon designed its own chips called Trainium (for AI training) and Inferentia (for AI inference).\n\nTrainium, for example, offers up to 50% cost-to-train savings over Amazon's other infrastructure, which means developers can stretch their funding to create more advanced models. That brings us to the middle layer of AI, which features ready-made LLMs for businesses seeking a turnkey solution instead. Bedrock on AWS has the largest selection of third-party LLMs in the industry, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 lineup, which are the best-performing models in the world. Businesses can use these in combination with their own data to accelerate the development of AI software.\n\nSoftware is the third and final layer, and Amazon has that covered, too. Amazon Q is a new virtual assistant embedded in AWS, and Jassy says it's the most capable AI-powered tool of its kind for software development. It has the highest known acceptance rate for code suggestions, and it also outranks all competing products in catching security vulnerabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS delivered a record $26.2 billion in revenue during the recent second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which represented 19% growth from the year-ago period. That result marked the third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth for the platform, and AI is a key reason why. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAI is enhancing Amazon's e-commerce business\n\nE-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, so the company is constantly searching for new ways to make the segment more efficient. Last year, Amazon broke its national fulfillment network into eight distinct regions to reduce logistics costs and deliver products to customers more quickly. Plus, it already relies upon hundreds of thousands of AI-powered autonomous robots to streamline its fulfillment processes.\n\nNow, Amazon is rolling out Project Private Investigator, which uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers. That should reduce the rate of returns, which, in turn, will lower costs and boost customer satisfaction.\n\nIt adds to a number of other AI tools that are already active on amazon.com. AI powers the recommendation engine to show shoppers the most relevant products, which helps drive sales. Additionally, customers can use a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus, which is trained on Amazon's entire product catalog, enabling it to answer questions and help with comparisons.\n\nAmazon also offers a suite of AI software to sellers, which empowers them to create more engaging product pages and ads to increase their conversions.\n\nWhy now could be a great time to buy Amazon stock\n\nAmazon generated $148 billion in revenue across all of its businesses during Q2, a 10% increase from the year-ago quarter. That takes its trailing 12-month revenue to $604.4 billion. Based on the company's market capitalization of $1.7 trillion, its stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of just 2.9, making it cheaper than every other tech giant valued at $1 trillion or more: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon has struggled to convert its revenue into profitability in the past, which is why investors assigned it such a low P/S ratio. In simple terms, they are saying Amazon's revenue isn't as valuable as the revenue generated by Nvidia, for example, because more of Nvidia's revenue flows to the bottom line as profit.\n\nHowever, Amazon has improved its bottom line dramatically over the last few quarters. It generated $13.5 billion in net income during Q2, a whopping 101% increase from the year-ago period. That followed three straight quarters of at least triple-digit percentage growth in net income, so there is clear momentum. AWS is the profit engine of the entire organization, but Amazon's e-commerce business is also benefiting from its AI and efficiency initiatives, which are boosting margins.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's profitability to continue climbing into 2025, when earnings per share could potentially come in at $5.85. That places its stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28.5, which is cheaper than the current 29.6 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index. So, Amazon looks attractive from that perspective too.\n\nUltimately, this could be a great entry point for investors who are willing to hold the stock while the AI revolution builds momentum into the end of this decade, as many forecasts suggest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Labor market, AI key themes in US earnings calls: Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "In a Wednesday note to clients, Goldman Sachs strategists highlighted key issues that company managements have faced in the second quarter. After reviewing earnings call transcripts, the bank identified three dominant themes: the labor market, consumer behavior, and AI.\n\nInvestor attention has shifted back to the labor market after July's payrolls report came in below expectations. Despite this, Goldman’s economists note that job openings still point to strong labor demand. The recent uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.3% was largely due to temporary layoffs and labor supply issues, particularly for new immigrants.\n\n\"Company commentary this quarter regarding hiring plans and the labor market largely reflects a healthy labor market,” strategists said in the note.\n\nAlthough some companies have discussed reducing headcount or slowing hiring, the overall tone suggests a better alignment between hiring needs and the available workforce, marking a major shift from the post-pandemic period when labor shortages were a major issue. The share of companies mentioning labor shortages has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, and references to layoffs in earnings calls remained low in 2Q.\n\nRegarding the state of the consumer, companies’ commentary on 2Q earnings calls has reflected mixed sentiment, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile some companies reported weaker sales due to ongoing macroeconomic pressures on consumers, others observed resilient spending. Discussions frequently centered on the affordability of products and disparities between low- and high-income consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, quantitative results from consumer earnings reports align with broader macroeconomic data, indicating a generally healthy U.S. consumer.\n\nS&P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors showed a 60/40 split between earnings beats and misses, challenging the idea that all consumer-facing stocks are struggling.\n\nThe US Consumer Dashboard also points to a reasonably healthy consumer, though economic data highlight growing disparities between income cohorts, with lower-income consumers facing slower income growth and divergent consumer sentiment compared to higher-income groups.\n\nOn the AI front, 2Q earnings calls continued to reflect strong hype around the technology, with a particular focus on the significant investments required to harness it.\n\nHyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) were closely watched as investors assessed both the demand for AI-enabled products and services and the companies' AI investment plans, strategists note.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing their earnings reports, consensus estimates for 2025 hyperscaler capital expenditures and R&D increased by 3%. This ongoing investment trend was echoed by companies involved in building AI infrastructure, including data center REITs, utilities, and semiconductor manufacturers.\n\n“These AI infrastructure companies highlighted that continued investment in AI would translate into a continued tailwind for their businesses,” strategists said.\n\nBeyond the hyperscalers, other firms emphasized the efficiency and productivity gains achieved through AI.\n\nYear to date, AI infrastructure stocks have outperformed the equal-weight S&P 500 by 20 percentage points, compared to 3 percentage points of underperformance for stocks tied to AI-enabled revenues and long-term productivity gains.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLabor market, AI key themes in US earnings calls: Goldman Sachs\n\nCisco shares jump on earnings beat and job cuts\n\nAdmiral shares soar on strong H1 results\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How the empire that Google built could be remade following monopoly ruling",
        "content": "The Justice Department successfully argued that Google acted as an illegal monopoly. Now comes the tricky part: Deciding what to do about it.\n\nDOJ attorneys are considering a number of options they could propose to US District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta as early as next month, according to reporting by Bloomberg and the New York Times.\n\nThe remedies range from an outright breakup of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to forcing the company to make its search engine data available to competitors to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\n\nThe DOJ and Google have until Sept. 4 to propose these or other changes to Mehta, who ruled earlier this month that the tech giant violated antitrust law. A hearing to discuss next steps is set for Sept. 6.\n\n\"I think it's going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability,\" antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said. Google CEO Sundar Pichai leaves a federal courthouse in Washington, DC, last October after closing arguments in the antitrust case against Google. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe remedies proposed by prosecutors could remake the market for online search, or have little impact at all, according to legal experts, depending on what takes place over the coming months.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And its lawyers could ask Judge Mehta to hold off on any orders to alter its behavior while it challenges his ruling in DC’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"We’ve passed a key milestone, but there’s still a lot of history to be written,\" a spokesman for Google search rival DuckDuckGo wrote in a statement following the district court's ruling.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law, on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders, to better ensure competition is restored to the two markets.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly a breakup of Google’s empire has the most potential to re-order the tech universe. That could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multi-billion dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe instead expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office-copier market. IN 1964 Xerox CEO Joseph Wilson holds 2400 copies of an original reproduced in one hour on a new Xerox copier. (AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company opened up its ecosystem by no longer allowing it to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe judge could also force Google to share more search data with rivals and force it to offer choice screens to device owners and browser users so that they can pick their preferred search engine.\n\nA spokesman for Google search rival, DuckDuckGo, told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped remedies would require Google to share click & query data.\n\nThe data, which helps search engines track what users are searching and how they navigate to a particular website, could help DuckDuckGo and other more privacy-oriented search engines compete against Google.\n\nUnlike Google, DuckDuckGo does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, predicted that remedies would require mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers to let consumers choose between Google, Bing (MSFT) Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, or other platforms. Amit Mehta, left, when he was an attorney arguing before the New York State Supreme Court in 2012. He is now the federal judge who will decide remedies in the Google monopoly case. Photo: DON EMMERT/AFP via Getty Images (DON EMMERT via Getty Images)\n\n\"It’s possible we’ll eventually see more phones and browsers pre-programmed to use another search engine,\" McGinn said.\n\nA likely scenario, the antitrust lawyers said, is for the judge to put an end to agreements that secure Google’s search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. Google pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple and Samsung smartphones.\n\nThese agreements were at the center of Judge Mehta’s ruling, said Proskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass, leading him to suspect any remedies will focus on the contracts that formalize them.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint, and an even narrower ruling,” Kass said.\n\nNo 'dramatic effect'\n\nAn end to the revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Apple (AAPL).\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser Spotlight Search and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 billion for Apple, each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google.\n\nOn the other hand, McGinn said, device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search, but under new, non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jeffries senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "A Boeing 767 freighter belonging to Cargojet delivers shipments for DHL at East Midlands Airport in the United Kingdom on Sept. 23, 2021. (Photo: Flickr/Alan Wilson)\n\nCargojet, the largest all-cargo airline in Canada, said core transportation revenue increased 11.5% in the second quarter from the prior year as the company taps into the booming international e-commerce logistics sector.\n\nGrowth in e-commerce was the primary factor behind Cargojet’s improved earnings and positive outlook for the second half of the year.\n\nRevenue from the domestic overnight network, dedicated contract flying in which transportation service is priced per flight hour and international charter service totaled CA$191.3 million, or US$139.3 million, according to Cargojet (TSX: CJT) results issued after Tuesday’s market close. The company generated an additional $32.3 million from fuel surcharges. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $57.6 million, up 6.5%, year over year, slightly ahead of consensus expectations.\n\nCargojet in late May began providing scheduled trans-Pacific charter service for Chinese e-commerce platforms under a three-year agreement with logistics provider Great Vision HK Express. In its earnings report, management said cooling inflation and continued interest rate reductions are giving consumers more room for discretionary purchases, especially through online retailers. The company was able to adjust its schedule to free up Boeing 767-300 converted freighters to support the Great Vision charter program without having to invest in new aircraft.\n\n“The Canadian consumer is very price-conscious. They’re shopping for more value. So this China business is basically fulfilling that gap, [giving them a] better shopping environment than what was just available in e-commerce within Canada,” said co-CEO Pauline Dhillon on a briefing call with analysts Wednesday morning.\n\nRevenue for all three business segments grew during the quarter, with the charter business reaching a quarterly record of $20.3 million.\n\nFlight activity increased 4.8% year over year during the second quarter and showed how demand is picking up again after contracting 5.2% last year and 2.9% in the first quarter. The improved volumes at a time of weak consumer confidence in Canada bode well for future growth when the domestic economy picks up.\n\nIncreased demand has enabled Cargojet to put its entire fleet of Boeing 757 converted freighters back to work. In late 2023, when the air cargo market was still in the early stage of recovering from a pronounced downturn, executives listed four 757s as surplus and announced plans to sell or lease them.\n\nDomestic volumes are benefiting from new last-mile delivery customers tendering shipments to support growing business from online retailers in Canada and strong Amazon sales, said co-CEO James Porteous. Co-load customers that contract for blocks of space in the domestic network include Amazon, FedEx, UPS and Canada Post.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon had its best Prime Days promotion in Canada during July, has reserved several Cargojet freighters for a four-to-five-day period in mid-October to support fulfillment during the next big sale, and has asked to increase its charter capacity for the peak season compared to last year, he said. The airline operated some 757 freighters for Amazon during the 2023 peak shipping season, but the retailer has asked for 767s this year – which offer 50% more capacity. Cargojet also currently operates two Amazon-supplied 767-300s for Amazon in Canada.\n\nTwo Cargojet freighters – a 767 provided by Amazon and a 757 – received a significant amount of damage during a hailstorm that hit Calgary International Airport on Aug. 5. Management said it has moved the planes to its main base in Hamilton, Ontario, for repairs and expects the 757 to return to service fairly quickly. The 767 will take another week or more to complete repairs, but the airline is using backup aircraft to make sure Amazon can serve customers on time.\n\nAfter operating 17 or 18 dedicated freighters under long-term leases during the busy period last year, “it’s entirely realistic to expect that we’ll operate more than that in peak season because of that demand,” Porteous added.\n\nDemand was strong across the board. DHL Express, which contracts with Cargojet to fly packages in its parcel network, is also seeing higher demand out of China and Europe, and the charter segment conducted an “unprecedented” 31 flights in June, the Cargojet chief executive said.\n\nManagement indicated the ability to add another 5% to 10% in volume growth during the second half without having to add aircraft, especially as two more aircraft will come out of heavy maintenance by November to help with the higher loads.\n\nThe contract with Great Vision HK Express came together in a couple of months, “a lot quicker than a normal contract of that magnitude and size,” Porteous said, reflecting the spike in direct-to-consumer fulfillment from China to North America in the past year. The full impact of the new business will be felt in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nCargojet is providing three flights per week out of Hangzhou to Vancouver, British Columbia, and its ability to feed 15 other major cities in Canada through its domestic network appealed to the Chinese logistics company, he said. Great Vision HK Express, which analysts suspect is moving shipments for Shein and Temu, also controls two Boeing 777 flights per week from Shanghai to Toronto that are operated by a Chinese carrier.\n\nPorteous said the $116 million estimated value of the Great Vision HK Express contract doesn’t include potential incremental revenue if the shipments are tendered for further distribution into Canada or for additional frequencies from China as Great Vision’s business grows.\n\nFleet strategy\n\nCargojet has a fleet of 41 Boeing 757 and 767 freighter aircraft. The company said it accelerated conversion plans for two Boeing 767 passenger jets because of the rebound in demand, with deliveries expected in the first and second quarters of 2025. One of those aircraft will replace a 767-200 with a lease that expires in February. Porteous said the company is confident about the fleet additions, considering the reductions at other Canadian airlines and the limited global availability of freighter capacity during a rising market. Last week, Air Canada disclosed that it has parked two Boeing 767-300 cargo jets because it doesn’t have enough business to justify the expense of operating them.\n\nThe updated 2024 budget includes $33 million in capital expenditures for fleet growth –  a sharp reduction from recent years but more than the $18 million originally budgeted at the start of the year. Cargojet recently acquired two Boeing 767-300s as feedstock for future passenger-to-freighter conversions. Management, however, is emphasizing increased cash flow to reward investors with dividend growth and share buybacks. The conservative approach is a reversal from two years ago when management admittedly overreached on fleet growth on the assumption that superheated cargo demand would continue after the pandemic. Cargojet in the past year backed out of investments for eight Boeing 777 converted freighters and sold four aircraft it had already acquired.\n\n“Cargojet is well positioned to capture growth opportunities that will provide the returns required to support the current level of invested capital,” the company said in an addendum to the financial statement, adding that early signs point to a potential strong finish for the year.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nCargojet enters charter deal for Chinese e-commerce\n\nThe post E-commerce, Amazon demand drive Cargojet volume growth appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 E-commerce Stocks Poised for a Comeback After Last Week’s Market Meltdown",
        "content": "On the morning of August 5, the unwinding of the Yen carry trade accelerated, leading to a spike in the expected volatility index. Investors were selling and asking questions later. Even the best e-commerce stocks suffered under this carnage. That pullback has created an opportunity to buy into one of the most enduring themes of our time.\n\nThe thesis for e-commerce stocks is straightforward. There has been a gradual shift from physical shopping to online shopping. After all, who doesn’t love shopping from the comfort of their homes and having items delivered on the same day!\n\nThese e-commerce stocks are winning against brick-and-mortar stores and their online peers. They have the scale to deliver value through lower prices and quicker delivery times. Still, with a significant portion of shopping happening in physical stores, there is a massive opportunity ahead. The recent pullback in these e-commerce stocks provides the perfect entry point to participate in this secular shift.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the best e-commerce stocks you can buy. Over the past three weeks, it has pulled back from $200, dropping by over 15%. Now, it offers an attractive risk-reward opportunity going forward. The long-term drivers of its outperformance are still in place.\n\nOver the years, Amazon has amassed over 200 million global Amazon Prime subscribers due to its obsessive customer focus. By offering a combination of low prices and quick delivery times, it has kept growing its loyal customer base. This has allowed the company to achieve a massive operating footprint. Keeping true to its ethos, the company has been giving back the cost savings from its economies of scale to customers via lower prices, quicker delivery times and value-added services like entertainment.\n\nToday, Amazon dominates the e-commerce market in North America and Europe. For instance, in the U.S., it accounts for 40% of retail e-commerce sales. What’s more, the company sees more growth opportunities ahead. For example, bundling more services on Amazon Prime to attract and retain more customers and using AI to improve its recommendation engine.\n\nWith these tailwinds, Amazon should be higher. However, after the recent pullback, it’s trading at one of its lowest historical valuations. The stock is a bargain at a forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings of 35 compared to a 5-year historical average of 181.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is Latin America’s most dominant e-commerce retailer. The fact that it has managed to relegate Amazon to second place in key markets like Brazil and Mexico points to its strength. Furthermore, since online shopping penetration in its markets lags North America and Europe, the stock has a significant growth runway.\n\nIndeed, the South American giant was one of the e-commerce stocks that delivered solid Q2 results. Net revenues increased 42% year-over-year to $5.1 billion in the quarter. This impressive performance was powered by strong growth in key markets. Net revenues in Brazil and Mexico grew 51% and 66%, respectively.\n\nThe online retailer showed impressive operating metrics highlighting its position as the preferred online marketplace in Latin and Central America. For the quarter, unique active buyers were 57 million compared to 48 million in Q2 2023 and items sold reached 416 million from 325 million. Due to growth in users and items sold, gross merchandise volume rose from $10.5 to $12.6 billion.\n\nMELI stock is on solid footing and could soar once the market recovers from the recent meltdown. At a forward price-to-sales of 4.6 and a forward P/E of 58, it is undervalued relative to its impressive growth rate.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) A close-up shot of a Coupang (CPNG) delivery vehicle.\n\nSource: Ki young / Shutterstock.com\n\nDubbed the Amazon of South Korea, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is one of the best e-commerce stocks. It’s the dominant player in the South Korean market, a geography with excellent e-commerce unit economics due to its high population density. Also, it is expanding into other Asian markets, such as Taiwan.\n\nRecent earnings proved why this retailer is one of the top e-commerce stocks to buy. On a constant currency basis, revenues grew 30% YOY. Even after excluding Farfetch, it achieved a respectable 23% growth. What’s more, commerce active customers increased 12% YOY.\n\nRegarding long-term growth, management sees a massive opportunity in the fragmented $560 billion e-commerce space. They expect tremendous growth in its third-party marketplace as more marketplace sellers join it. Moreover, the company continues to make more investments to enhance marketplace and Fulfillment and Logistics by Coupang (FLC) growth.\n\nIn terms of profitability, management expects to continue expanding margins by scaling margin-efficient offerings and supply chain optimization. In Q2, for instance, gross margins improved by 310 basis points YOY to 29.3%. Due to these margin improvements and growth, gross profits increased 41% YOY to $2.1 billion.\n\nConsidering the growth and profitability improvements, CPNG stock is a buy. The company continues its international expansion and is growing its third-party marketplace business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "While the global industrial automation market is poised for a CAGR of 8.3% between 2024 and 2031, according to SkyQuest, it bears winnowing out the particulars of the market, including identifying robotics stocks to sell. With signals pointing to global economic slowdown and the reduction in capital expenditures, robotics investments may also suffer.\n\nLikewise, some robotics stocks are more vulnerable to plateauing, while others could rise from present weakness.\n\nCovering these scenarios, here are three strong candidates for robotics stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDynatrace (DT) Trader studies stock information against the background of a keyboard key with the inscription sell. Work on the stock exchange. Purchase-sale of assets on the stock exchange. Stock analyst at work. Stocks to sell\n\nSource: FOTOGRIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of key aspects of robotics and automation is ensuring their operations work as intended. Software performance is the broader niche for Dynatrace (NYSE:DT), offering application performance management (APM) and cloud-native monitoring. The latter is especially prevalent in automation processes as they rely on cloud or edge computing for processing power.\n\nIn this role, Dynatrace licenses DEM (Digital Experience Management), Host-Based Licensing (HU) and DPS (Data Platform Subscription). In January, the company announced Data Observability that combines data science, analytics and its proprietary Davis hypermodal AI engine to remove false positives and other errors.\n\nHowever, with a market share of 3% in the APM market, Dynatrace faces tough competition from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)API Gateway, GoogleCloud, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) AppDynamics.\n\nAs such, Dynatrace is vulnerable to Big Tech moves, making it one of the robotics stocks to sell, evidenced when it had to discontinue support for the Chrome and MS Edge browser extension in January.\n\nMoreover, the company’s resources appear to be heavily involved with gender-politics. Given the highly competitive APM market, this is not a positive signal. Although the company’s revenue increased 19% year-over-year in Q2 2024, Dynatrace net income effectively flatlined at 1.1% increase.\n\nDynatrace entered the profitability zone in Q1 2020, typically exhibiting long periods of stagnation and fluctuation. Presently, DT stock appears to be on the upper end of the cycle with shares priced at $47 against the 52-week average of $48.56, having gone up by 1.82% in the last three months.\n\nPROCEPT Biorobotics (PRCT) A white clock indicates it's time to sell. overvalued stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCalifornia-based PROCEPT Biorobotics (NASDAQ:PRCT) made a name for itself with the flagship AquaBeam Robotic System. The real-time imaging surgical robot uses waterjet technology to treat prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), otherwise known as benign prostate enlargement.\n\nStory continues\n\nBPH is relatively common, affecting up to 90% of men older than 80, according to the NIH. However, data from the American Urological Associationshows that BPH is treated mostly through medication with surgery not required for most men. Although the company’s innovative aquablation (waterjet) therapy allows for tissue removal without thermal (laser) injury, it still involves invasive treatment.\n\nIn Q2 2024 earnings, the company reported 47 sales of AquaBeam Robotic System, generating $53.4 million revenue. Despite making for a 61% annual growth, PROCEPT Biorobotics is yet to show signs of entering profitability zone sustainably.\n\nWithout a single profitable quarter, the company reported $25.6 million net loss, slightly greater than the $25.3 million net loss in the year-ago quarter. Priced at $63.33 against the 52-week average of $47.28, PRCT stock makes for a solid candidate for robotics stocks to sell.\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) Death: grim reaper in black cloak\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is an established company connecting employees with assets across diversified sectors such as logistics, healthcare, hospitality, banking, government orgs, retail and warehouse automation.\n\nIn August 2021, Zebra made a big move in warehouse automation by acquiring Fetch Robotics worth $290 million. With a lineup of different autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), the company matched Fetch robots with its existing automation solutions FulfillmentEdge and SmartSight.\n\nHowever, Zebra competitor Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) may be a better exposure at the moment.\n\nUsing machine vision, the company’s robotic systems range from fixed (de-)palletizing ones to autonomous mobile robots. On top of that, Symbotic has an AI-powered software with which to optimize the operations of robotic fleets.\n\nThis end-to-end tech also found its way into major retail chains such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), C&S Wholesale Grocers and Albertsons (NYSE:ACI). Although Symbotic is yet to become profitable since going public two years ago, in the last Q3 2024 earnings ending July 29th, the company reported $14 million net loss vs the net loss of $39 million in the year-ago quarter\n\nMoreover, Symbotic acquired Veo Robotics in August for $8.7 million for its FreeMove tech used in human-robot collaboration. More established ZBRA stock is up nearly 20% year-to-date at pricier $320 per share.\n\nSYM stock is down 57% to $21.23, nearly cut in half from its 52-week average of $40.64 and close to its 52-week low of $20.90 per share. This provides a high growth opportunity as heavier ZBRA is less agile than SYM, with its average price target of $44.9 per Nasdaq forecasting data.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top-Performing Growth Stocks That Should Keep Running From Here",
        "content": "The past decade and a half have truly been incredible for investors. Most could have chosen from a list of top-performing growth stocks and done just fine for themselves. Many of the largest and what many consider the “best” growth stocks have outperformed smaller counterparts, which isn’t usually the case.\n\nIn recent months, the stock market environment has been much more turbulent than in the past. Volatility has picked up as various macro forces continue to shift, and global dynamics remain in flux.\n\nHowever, many analysts remain optimistic that top-performing growth stocks will continue to outperform over the long term. A number of the companies on this list are widely regarded as buys and have been for a long time. They’re just picks I tend to agree with on a consensus basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive in!\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough it’s difficult to predict stock movements, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock price has historically correlated with its operating profit. This e-commerce giant’s stock generally peaks when its operating profits increase and falls when they decline. That makes a strong fundamental case for buying in times like this when Amazon sees strong fundamental growth.\n\nDuring 2024’s first half, Amazon’s operating income surged 141% year-over-year, marking a new record peak. Most of the profit came from Amazon’s Web Services (AWS). The segment has contributed 84% of its second-quarter operating profit. It is important to consider Amazon’s performance, especially when forecasting its profit. With AWS being a leading cloud platform, industry forecasts suggest annual growth between 15% and 21% through 2028. The fundamental trends certainly point in the right direction for long-term investors.\n\nAmazon’s growth story remains strong despite recent market volatility and disappointing Q2 earnings. Analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) maintain positive ratings on AMZN stock, noting the company’s long-term potential. Despite a 15% stock drop this month and rising e-commerce competition, Amazon’s dominance suggests now is a prime time to invest.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) stock has surged 21.3% year-to-date after a slow 2023 despite recent earnings misses. Boosted by a strong backlog and AI deals, Oracle’s recent stock dip presents a buying opportunity. Its advancements in AI and cloud services have shown strength and increases, making ORCL stock worth adding.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle’s balance sheet showed $131.7 billion in liabilities against $19.4 billion in total receivables and cash. That’s a rather large discrepancy, which could lead some investors to look for other more fundamentally sound options in the tech space. However, despite this large shortfall, Oracle’s $363.9 billion market cap and ability to raise capital over time do provide a buffer.\n\nWith debt currently 3.6 times its EBITDA and interest expenses covered 5.1 times by EBIT, Oracle’s leverage is manageable, provided it maintains strong EBIT growth over time. That’s to say nothing of the company’s recent layoff announcements, which should bolster efficiency and improve these metrics meaningfully over time.\n\nIn recent news, Oracle and AT&T (NYSE:T) have teamed up to enhance 5G and IoT integration, incorporating AT&T’s network APIs into Oracle’s Enterprise Communications Platform. Despite 5G’s underwhelming impact compared to its hype, the partnership aims to improve IoT connectivity through Oracle’s industry cloud solutions, offering unified management of IoT devices. This collaboration is expected to benefit large enterprises and global organizations by streamlining IoT provisioning in the cloud.\n\nByd (BYDDF)\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), often dubbed the “Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) of China,” briefly surpassed Tesla as the world’s top EV maker. Despite Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) typical tech aversion, the Warren Buffett-led giant holds 6% of the company’s outstanding float, a move praised by late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. Initially a battery supplier, BYD’s shift to EVs leveraged its battery expertise, which is now complemented by vertical integration for cost advantages. With a 35% market share in China and trading at 21 times earnings, BYD appears poised for further growth.\n\nThe company leads the global EV market with an 18% share and is the second-largest power battery producer. Its power capacity and storage grew 35% over the past year. Expanding aggressively into international markets, BYD sold 26,995 vehicles abroad in June. In Q2 2024, the company sold nearly 1 million new energy vehicles, up 58% from the previous quarter.\n\nBYD’s international sales surged 156% in June 2024, with a 58% increase in Q2 new energy vehicle sales. Despite robust July sales, BYD’s U.S. stock fell 3.8% due to market concerns. Uber’s deal with BYD will add 100,000 EVs to its platform in select regions, enhancing global EV adoption. Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD remains a strong Chinese EV stock choice.\n\nFinding the best of the best in terms of top-performing growth stocks is easier said than done. Amazon (AMZN): Despite market volatility and disappointing recent earnings, the company’s strong growth potential is hard to match, given its size. Oracle (ORCL): With additional partnerships in the cloud and IoT sectors, this is a growth stock many may be overlooking right now. BYD (BYDDF): Given China’s quick adoption of EVs, the world’s largest EV maker could be poised for much greater growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "Last Monday’s market rout saw tech stocks, specifically AI stocks experience major selloffs as investors across the board decided to take profits from overvalued positions.\n\nIn fact, for many of the companies that experienced the correction, the selloff was a long time coming. As such, oversold AI stocks could be poised for a strong comeback as investors flock back to bullish sentiments on AI.\n\nMoreover, these three AI stocks could see their prospects improve as a result of broader tech success beyond the news-cathing AI products. As a result, these companies might offer investors more long-term stability than companies that trade as pure plays in AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, as a word of caution, the market itself has not escaped the downward pressures of a potential U.S. recession. This means that at any time, these stocks could experience another downturn as the one seen last week.\n\nAs such, investors should look cautiously upon these three AI stocks with potential comebacks in the making.\n\nMonday.com (MNDY) Monday.com (MNDY) logo displayed on smartphone held by two hands\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/monticello\n\nAs a provider of project management software, Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) doesn’t seem like one of the most obvious plays among AI stocks, its prospects appear strong to most analysts. Much of the recent excitement comes from the company’s exceptional second-quarter earnings report.\n\nSpecifically, the company excelled in revenue growth and soaring net income.\n\nAs a result, the company posted a beat of EPS expectations by 67% with a more modest revenue beat around 3%. This has turned broader media attention positive on the stock, with investors buying into it after last week’s tech selloff left it slightly discounted.\n\nMoreover, the company’s notable metrics increases in net dollar retention rate which came in at 110% overall suggest it will not struggle to keep up this momentum heading into the next quarter. This could bode exceptionally well for investors who buy in during this comeback run.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith heavy investment into AI spending, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has a lot to gain from a comeback story, though its stock did not suffer as much last week as others.\n\nHaving largely avoided a major loss in value, Meta has more of a solid upward trajectory ahead of it rather than s standard comeback.\n\nMuch of the company’s momentum has come from healthy increases in valuation as its fundamentals continue to project serious growth. This, alongside major news about its augmented reality projects and AI platforms, could push the stock even higher by the end of the year. This makes the $600 mark possible in the face of continued growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company has successfully pulled off a pivot from the standard social media image to one of a tech investment firm working to push the edges of innovation. As such, investors should seriously consider Meta stock as a strong option for a growth-focused portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, no company has as much flexibility, thanks to diverse revenue streams as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) does. That’s because recently, the company has shown dominant sales performance, despite the slowing consumer market. Moreover, many of its services are still in demand, thanks to a 14% increase year-over-year in service revenues.\n\nAs such, through its strong data collection efforts with Amazon web services, AMZN stock is likely to have no issues with recovering from last week’s text stock so off. Looking at the companies price to earnings ratio of 40x, it’s likely that Amazon will be able to sustain further growth once it goes back on the uptrend following last week’s market crash.\n\nAmazon’s expansion could, however, slow. This would be the case if the U.S. enters a full recession, or if the Federal Reserve does not cut interest rates over the next few months, both of which cases are likely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "'Sheriff of Silicon Valley': How Kamala Harris's tenure as California AG could shape her approach to Big Tech",
        "content": "During Kamala Harris’s stint as California’s top prosecutor, few knew her better than Travis LeBlanc — the special assistant attorney general of California and one of her most senior advisers.\n\nWhile working for Harris, LeBlanc’s responsibilities included tech regulation, cybersecurity, privacy, and antitrust. Yahoo Finance spoke to LeBlanc exclusively about Harris's moves during her tenure from 2011 to 2017, including her business track record and pro-growth approach to tech companies.\n\n“She is mindful that there are large players and small players in tech, and those aren't the same,” LeBlanc said. “One of the biggest concerns is that disruptors are given an opportunity to succeed, and that they aren't squelched by either an incumbent or a very large player in the market before they've had a chance to flourish.”\n\nInsight into a Harris administration\n\nLast week, the US Dept. of Justice ruled that Google (GOOGL, GOOG) violated an antitrust law with its search business. The ruling, a major victory for the Biden administration, could serve as a template for future cases. However, Harris has so far stayed silent on what an antitrust environment would look like if she were elected president.\n\nLeBlanc said one of Harris's biggest goals has always been “giving disruptors an opportunity to compete, recognizing that the incentives of incumbents and larger companies may be to use the power of the government to help exclude them from competing in the marketplace.”\n\nIn 2012, Harris sued and reached a $3.75 million settlement with eBay (EBAY) over allegations the company violated anti-competitive laws regarding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit.\n\nOne of the biggest antitrust cases Harris handled came in late 2011 when she successfully blocked AT&T’s buyout of T-Mobile’s US operations. At the time, Harris joined 10 other states that banded together following several meetings with AT&T's leadership.\n\n“That was a very big deal,” LeBlanc said. “T-Mobile used that to become the T-Mobile that we know of today. They now compete directly with AT&T and Verizon.”\n\nWhile her prosecutorial record in California provides some hints on how she would run the country, LeBlanc and several former staffers Yahoo Finance spoke to describe Harris as an effective communicator who wouldn’t always use litigation as a tool.\n\nOne of Harris's key accomplishments as attorney general was in 2012 when her office reached an agreement with six tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google, Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ), and Research In Motion, requiring the companies to include clear privacy policies for users before they downloaded apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I can't imagine that today those companies would all sign an agreement with any attorney general or department of justice,” LeBlanc said. “It was a real testament to her ability to convene, to work with the stakeholders, and to try and achieve a resolution that would benefit everyone.”\n\nAs vice president, Harris has played a key role in the Biden administration’s efforts around artificial intelligence.\n\n“President Biden and I reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation,” Harris said at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London last year. “We can and we must do both.”\n\nLeBlanc said a Harris administration would likely continue parts of Biden’s AI policies, adding she will “be mindful that the technology is evolving, and if we're going to regulate it, we need to do so in a way that’s nimble, so that we don't end up impeding the progress of technology in the future in ways that no one intended today.” Vice President Kamala Harris swearing in Travis LeBlanc to his second term on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in October 2022. (Twitter.com/VP)\n\nBig Tech vs the FTC\n\nWhen Harris was running to become California’s attorney general in 2010, wealthy supporters included Salesforce (CRM)’s Marc Benioff, Apple’s Jony Ive, Meta (META)’s Sheryl Sandberg, and the wife of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs (who is also the founder and president of Emerson Collective).\n\nOn Sunday, Harris returned to the city where her political career began for a fundraiser. It was her first trip back to San Francisco since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket. “This is a room full of dear, dear, dear friends,” Harris said to the gathering of Silicon Valley elites. She raised $13 million that day.\n\nThe pro-Harris movement in tech includes donations and endorsements from Netflix (NFLX)’s Reed Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Box (BOX)’s Aaron Levie, Khosla Venture's Vinod Khosla, and Melinda French Gates, among others.\n\nBut Harris faces a delicate balance between appeasing her donors and regulating the tech industry. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who donated $7 million to her campaign, told CNN last month that if Harris is elected she should replace Lina Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nKhan’s term expires in September and her future as FTC chair remains unknown. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft — a company with a history of clashing with the FTC. According to Hoffman, Harris should elect a new antitrust chief, as Khan is “waging a war on American business.”\n\nWhen asked if Hoffman or the opinion of her deep-pocketed tech donors would impact Harris's decision on who should lead the FTC, LeBlanc said, “I think she will ultimately make any personnel decisions based on who she thinks is the right person for the job.”\n\nFormer staffers say Harris helped shape Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley shaped Harris, who once campaigned on being the “sheriff of Silicon Valley.” It remains to be seen if she will have the same moniker if she’s elected commander in chief.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The energy company uses a generative AI platform built on Amazon Bedrock to provide its workforce with access to a choice of the world’s leading foundation models and tools to easily and securely build generative AI applications. For example, the company is building a generative AI application that will help the Iberdrola legal team quickly find and ask questions about corporate contracts. In addition, Iberdrola is developing generative AI assistants that use real-time internet of things (IoT) data to provide field maintenance workers with specific instructions on how to service and repair power infrastructure and renewable sites more efficiently. Iberdrola is also using generative AI-powered voicebots that help sales teams answer customer questions around products and tariffs in real time.\n\nExperts from AWS Professional Services will develop a next-generation data platform that will help Iberdrola to further optimize the electricity being generated from its renewable energy assets. This centralized data lake will consolidate data from Iberdrola's renewable energy assets and business operations, enabling the company to better gain operational insights. By integrating the data from over 400 renewable energy sites globally, Iberdrola will use AWS generative AI, Renewables Data Lake and Analytics, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon SageMaker to conduct real-time asset monitoring, initiate predictive maintenance, and generate power-demand forecasts to increase operational efficiency.\n\n\"We see AI playing a central role in helping us to deliver the smart grid, renewables, and storage technology that will drive the energy transition forward,\" said Sergio Merchan, global CIO at Iberdrola. \"As our preferred cloud provider, AWS will provide an innovative technical foundation to support us on this journey. Combining our unified data approach with AI and machine learning capabilities will help us build smarter and more secure networks to automate smart grids and more easily integrate renewable energy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We're excited to work with Iberdrola to help them use data and generative AI to transform their customer and employee experience, while driving large operational efficiency gains that will help meet the growing demands for electricity powered by carbon-free energy,\" said Howard Gefen, general manager of Energy & Utilities at AWS. \"By harnessing AWS, Iberdrola can unlock new opportunities for innovation and efficiency across their operations. Our generative AI capabilities will empower Iberdrola to streamline processes, enhance customer experiences, and drive safe, energy solutions for a better future.\"\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "title": "3 Russell 2000 Stocks to Sell Before You Regret It",
        "content": "The Russell 2000 index is a collection of the smallest 2000 stocks within the overall Russell index. It is a controversial pick for many investors. While it provides significant exposure to the small-cap market, it also carries with it some of the risk (and reward) small-cap companies hold. This means that it is much more volatile than other similarly diversified indices. Additionally, historically speaking, it has underperformed several indices, including the S&P 500, which is essentially the opposite of the Russell; it is a collection of the 500 largest American companies. Today, we’ll take a look at the Russell 2000 stocks to sell that are simply too volatile to risk.\n\nWhile there are many companies in the Russell that are great picks and have offered investors tremendous growth, there are also companies that disappoint investors time and time again. This includes everything from meme stocks to companies that have been underperforming and have seen a sustained drop in revenue. Thus, investors should stay vigilant, especially if they invest in companies in the index instead of the index itself.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) After the pandemic, almost all of us got familiar with GameStop. The quintessential video game retailer turned into a meme stock overnight with Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) behind it. Especially after a recent resurgence, GME remains a company you should sell, especially at the price of almost $22, which is at risk of an implied downside of 62%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company hasn’t been profitable or has operated on negligible profit for the last few years, essentially being a billion-dollar cash-burning machine. However, it gets worse for investors; GME has missed both Q1 and Q2 2024 EPS estimates. Even in the bull case, analysts estimate the company will lose up to half of its current value within the next year.\n\nA lack of strong catalysts also plagues GME. Consumers are increasingly relying on online shopping, and GME simply doesn’t have the infrastructure to compete with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which offers same-day or overnight delivery — something GME is lacking. While subscriptions like GameStop Pro, the GameStop credit card, etc. are things to look out for, lots of debt and negative growth will be a significant risk. Thus, GME is on our list of Russell 2000 stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC movie theater front glowing in the setting sun with the name shining bright red. AMC stock.\n\nSource: Ian Dewar Photography / Shutterstock\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is yet another pandemic-era meme stock that will leave return-hungry investors starving. While it is quite volatile as it stands, the company’s niche market of screening movies is also likely to fail in the long run. At a stock price of just over $5, it is down nearly 18% year-to-date, and I expect it to keep falling.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC’s financial details are, in short, a mess. The company has a negative profit and operating margin, as well as a significant quarterly revenue decline of 23.5%. The company has over $8.5 billion in debt, with only $770 million in cash. Additionally, approximately 15% of floating shares are shorted, showing waning industrial support and rising skepticism.\n\nAdditionally, the movie theater industry in the U,S, has declined significantly — around 6.8% per year on average between 2018 and 2023. The rise of home entertainment systems — popularized by the pandemic — plays into this heavily. Thus, I believe that should the overall industry continue to deteriorate, AMC will remain a sell.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding cellphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a company that many of you will be unfamiliar with. This is because of the fact that PLUG makes hydrogen and other fuel cell based technology. PLUG seems to be betting heavily on hydrogen-powered electric vehicles, something that remains a distant and seemingly increasingly unlikely possibility due to supply chain issues.\n\nPLUG is currently trading at a price of $1.98. It has missed earnings per share estimates for the last four quarters, indicating that there is something “wrong” with the company. The profit margin is -216.8%, which is extremely bad, even for a company that is as innovative (read capital intensive) as PLUG.\n\nAdditionally, all that investment into PLUG doesn’t seem to be paying off; the company is staring at a year-over-year quarterly revenue decline of almost 45%. And while leadership changes are occurring, the company has no strong catalyst right now, which is a big threat and appears to be priced in, as 30% of the float is shorted right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Have Entered Correction Territory",
        "content": "Wall Street pays significant attention to the technology sector as tech companies typically deliver substantial returns to investors. However, the volatile nature of this industry means that tech stocks can especially short-term experience downturns. This volatility is typically a result of macroeconomic factors, company-specific challenges and market sentiment. Recently, the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC) has seen a decline of nearly 4% in July and another 6% in August, although it remains up 1.5% year-to-date.\n\nWhen the broader economy raises concerns, investors become increasingly wary of tech companies that deliver less-than-perfect growth rates. This earnings season, we are witnessing notable declines in share prices of many tech names. In most cases, they have failed to announce strong results that justify high valuation metrics.\n\nTherefore, in this article, we will discuss three tech stocks that have recently entered correction territory, each seeing a decline of more than 10% from their recent highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConfluent (CFLT) Cloud graphic with wires coming out of it symbolizing cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOur first stock is Confluent (NASDAQ:CFLT), a player in the real-time data streaming space. Confluent offers two main products: Confluent Cloud, a managed cloud-native service, and Confluent Platform, an enterprise-grade self-managed software. These products facilitate the connection and processing of data in real-time.\n\nAs we write, Confluent’s stock is trading around $20.00. Yet, the company has seen its stock price dip significantly in recent months. For example, over the past month, it has lost well over 20%. Similarly, since the start of the year, CFLT shares have shed more than 13%.\n\nConfluent went public in June 2021 amid high expectations, but it has struggled to maintain its lofty valuations as market conditions have changed. At present, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for CFLT stock is over 87x. Overall, its valuation metrics are a lot higher than the industry average.\n\nWhile Confluent continues to expand its customer base and revenue, growth has slowed compared to the earlier stages of its public life. This deceleration has made it challenging for the company to achieve profitability, with the most recent earnings reporting a loss of nearly $90 million.\n\nConfluent also faces competition from larger players like Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, which offer their own real-time data streaming solutions. Although Confluent’s platform is specialized, the presence of such formidable competitors raises concerns about its ability to capture market share in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Wall Street is still bullish on CFLT shares with a 12-month median price target of $31.00. Such an up move would mean a gain of well over 50%. Yet, we believe the immediate market sentiment appears cautious for tech stocks like CFLT, with concerns over competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nThe social media platform Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has also entered correction territory. The company is known for its visually-driven search and discovery engine. In late June, PINS shares were trading over $45, but now, Pinterest stock is around $29.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for Pinterest’s stock decline is the slowdown in user growth. After a pandemic-driven surge, the platform has struggled to maintain its user base, particularly in the U.S., its most lucrative market. There are concerns that Pinterest may have reached saturation in some areas, and its ability to reignite growth is uncertain. Following recent quarterly results, management provided a lower-than-expected sales outlook.\n\nIn addition to slowing user growth, Pinterest has struggled to effectively monetize its platform. Despite progress in building its advertising capabilities, it still lags behind social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, both owned by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In a tightening economic environment, advertisers remain cautious. And Pinterest has had difficulty convincing them it can deliver the same return on investment as its larger rivals.\n\nMoreover, the shift towards video content on social media platforms has not played to Pinterest’s strengths. At present, platforms like TikTok and Instagram continue to dominate the short-form video space. As a result, Pinterest’s relatively static content offering may be seen as less appealing to both users and advertisers.\n\nNonetheless, analysts have a favorable long-term opinion on PINS stock as evidenced by a price target of $44.00. Such a move would mean a return of about 52%. As Pinterest continues to navigate numerous challenges, its ability to innovate in a competitive market will be crucial for its long-term success.\n\nProcore Technologies (PCOR) A laptop displays the logo for Procore Technologies (PCOR).\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe conclude our discussion with Procore Technologies (NYSE:PCOR), a cloud-based construction management software company, which went public in May 2021. Like many recent IPOs especially among tech stocks, Procore’s stock initially soared but has since entered correction territory.\n\nSince late July, PCOR shares have declined around 25%. A significant factor behind this decline is the market’s shift away from high-growth, unprofitable tech companies. More investors want to put their hard-earned cash into toward more stable, profitable enterprises.\n\nProcore has yet to achieve profitability, which concerns investors despite strong revenue growth. The latest earnings report showed a reduced net loss of $6.3 million, down from $52.9 million a year ago. However, revenue guidance for the next quarter fell short of expectations, and slowing customer growth raised concerns about future prospects. In the current high-interest-rate environment, unprofitable tech companies like Procore are particularly vulnerable, as the cost of capital rises and investors become more risk-averse.\n\nMeanwhile, the construction industry Procore serves faces challenges, including economic cycles, rising material costs, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions. These factors may limit construction companies’ ability to invest in new software solutions like Procore’s.\n\nYet Wall Street believes the decline should be over for Procore share price. Analysts currently expect PCOR stock to rally around 21% from the current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "25 Cities with the Highest Electricity Consumption in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we explore the top 25 cities in the US with the highest electricity consumption. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go to 5 Cities with the Highest Electricity Consumption in the US.\n\nElectricity is vital for our daily life and the world economy. It is the source of lighting, heating, cooling, refrigeration, appliances, computers, electronics, machinery, and public transport. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average American family spends approximately $2,060 annually on utility bills, covering electricity, natural gas, water, and trash services. This translates to about $171 per month for electricity, $68 for natural gas, $75 for water, and $14 for trash collection.\n\nIn 2023, the United States consumed about 4,014 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, a 1% drop from the previous year due to milder summer temperatures reducing residential demand. Despite this, residential electricity use remained higher than the five-year average because of more people working from home during the pandemic. In 2022, U.S. electricity consumption hit a record high of around 4.07 trillion kWh, which is 14 times higher than in 1950. Between 1950 and 2022, annual U.S. electricity consumption increased most years, with significant declines occurring mainly after 2007.\n\nAmid the pandemic, industrial and commercial electricity usage declined due to shutdowns and increased remote work. However, residential electricity consumption has risen over the past few months, surpassing the last five years' average. This increase is attributed to more people working from home, leading to higher electricity, internet, and phone usage. Additionally, more frequent cooking and dishwasher use has contributed to the rise in energy consumption.\n\nClimate plays a significant role in energy usage. Households in colder regions use more energy for heating in the winter, while those in warmer regions have higher usage in the summer. Data from the EIA shows that households in the Northeast and Midwest have the highest average energy consumption, whereas those in the more temperate West use the least.\n\nHistorically, lighting was the largest electricity user in the commercial sector, but its share has decreased due to efficient lighting technologies. Conversely, electricity usage for computers and office equipment has risen. Space cooling depends on weather, climate, building design, and heat generated by lighting, computers, appliances, and occupants.\n\nAs technology advances, power trends are increasingly shaped by the growing demand for data centers and artificial intelligence (AI). Data centers require substantial electricity to support their vast servers and cooling systems, while AI developments drive further energy consumption due to the need for high-performance computing and large-scale data processing.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies that are likely to benefit from increased AI-driven electricity demand include\n\nVistra Corp.\n\n(NYSE:VST), a major independent power producer and retail electricity provider in the US. Despite facing volatility in domestic electricity demand, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) has strategically improved its capital allocation.\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) has adapted to the weak demand for fossil fuels by shutting down unprofitable coal plants and repurchasing 33% of its shares from 2018 to 2023, as pointed out by Billionaire activist investor Dan Loeb in his Q1 2024 investor letter. As the electricity generation sector experiences significant growth driven by rising global demand from the US, substantial opportunities are emerging for industry leaders. In particular, hyperscalers are expected to increasingly locate their data centers near Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s power plants, positioning the company to benefit from this expanding market.\n\nData centers are projected to increase their share of US power demand from about 3% to 8% by 2030, indicating a major expansion. Additionally, cloud computing leaders are likely to depend more on nuclear energy for their data centers, making Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)’s ability to supply this demand crucial for its positive outlook. As top tech companies seek direct contracts with nuclear power providers for clean and reliable energy, Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is well-positioned to benefit.\n\nVistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s acquisition of Energy Harbor's nuclear assets aligns with the growing shift towards nuclear energy. This strategic positioning, combining both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets, places Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in a strong position to benefit from AI-driven electricity demand, leading to a positive outlook for the company.\n\nOn the other hand, the industrial sector uses electricity for various purposes. For example, industries like aluminum and steel production need electricity for heating processes, while food processing uses it for cooling and freezing. Some manufacturers, such as pulp and paper mills and lumber mills, produce their own electricity, often through combined heat and power systems. They might even sell some of this electricity. According to the Annual Energy Outlook 2023 Reference case, manufacturers were responsible for about 78% of the industrial sector's total electricity purchases in 2022. The remaining purchases were split between construction (8%), mining (8%), and agriculture (7%).\n\nShort-term changes in U.S. electricity demand can vary with yearly weather changes, but long-term trends are influenced more by economic growth and improvements in energy efficiency. According to the AEO2023 Reference case, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow by about 1% per year from 2022 to 2050. 25 Cities with the Highest Electricity Consumption in the US\n\nIkonoklast Fotografie/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 25 cities with the highest electricity consumption in the US, we first collected annual electricity consumption data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

        "content": "It might be hard to imagine, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began only 30 years ago as an online bookseller. Now the site sells a wide range of goods. The business has grown quickly and includes the popular Amazon Prime subscription service, electronic devices, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe shares have also generated a lot of wealth for investors. Investors who bought shares a decade ago, and held them, would have seen an increase of almost 1,000%.\n\nTrouncing the market\n\nAmazon had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997, when its sales were about $148 million for the year. The figure grew to nearly $575 billion last year.\n\nBut you didn't have to buy the shares at the IPO price to make a lot of money. Over the last decade, Amazon's shares have appreciated 945%. That easily bested the S&P 500's 227% total return.\n\nEven starting with a relatively small $1,000 just 10 years ago, you would now have about $10,500. Placing the same amount in the S&P 500 would've resulted in about $3,300.\n\nAmazon's stock will likely have a hard time reproducing those kinds of returns over the next 10 years, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth buying.\n\nAmazon shares have a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39, much higher than the S&P 500's 27 multiple. That suggests the market has high expectations for Amazon's growth.\n\nCloud computing business AWS remains the company's main profit generator. The unit's sales grew 18.6% to $26.3 billion in the most recent quarter, and operating income went from $5.4 billion to $9.3 billion. It also has the highest operating margin, 36.5%, among the company's three segments. Prospects look good given business's demand for data, and the artificial intelligence push could give the business a further boost.\n\nHowever, with the relatively high valuation, you may want to employ dollar-cost averaging to purchase shares over time. That way, you invest small sums at regular intervals, and you won't have to worry about timing the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "META, NFLX, or AMZN: Which Growth Stock Is the Best Pick?",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates in September. This could increase investors’ focus on growth stocks. Companies in the growth phase invest significantly in their businesses. Consequently, they tend to benefit from lower borrowing costs when interest rates reduce. With this backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to place Meta Platforms (META), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN) against each other to find the best growth stock, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms shares have rallied about 46% year-to-date. The company’s upbeat second-quarter results and a better-than-anticipated outlook for the third quarter of 2024 reflected strong execution and a solid position in the digital ad market.\n\nIt is worth noting that Meta Platform’s Q2 earnings per share (EPS) surged 73% to $5.16, driven by 22% revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Remarkably, Q2 operating margin expanded to 38% from 29% in the prior-year quarter, fueled by the company’s streamlining and cost-cutting measures.\n\nMETA is experiencing the benefits of its significant artificial intelligence (AI) investments. AI is improving recommendations and helping users find better content on Meta Platforms’ apps. The company estimates capital expenditure in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion in 2024 and has cautioned that it expects a significant rise in capex next year to support its AI research and product development initiatives.\n\nIs META a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nOn August 1, Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on META stock and boosted the price target to $563 from $550. The analyst views Meta as “the top AI play” in the consumer internet space.\n\nPost explained that his bullish stance is backed by the company’s leading infrastructure and large language model (LLM) capabilities, solid ad growth driven by core AI, and new multi-year growth prospects in generative AI.\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. At $549.35, the average META stock price target indicates 6.5% upside potential.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNetflix reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2024. The company’s revenue grew 16.8%, driven by its crackdown on password sharing and efforts to boost subscribers for the ad-supported tier. Global paid memberships increased 16.5% to about 278 million, with 8.05 million additions in the second quarter.\n\nStrong top-line growth and robust margins drove more than a 48% rise in the EPS. Despite the upbeat Q2 results, shares fell as the company’s Q2 free cash flow declined to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, Netflix’s Q3 revenue outlook fell short of expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix sees continued growth in its ad-supported plans, as they enable the company to offer lower prices to customers and create an additional profit stream through ad revenues. The streaming giant also continues to strengthen its content base to attract more customers.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for Netflix Stock?\n\nOn August 7, Jefferies analyst James Heaney reaffirmed a Buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of $780. The analyst believes that the recent pullback offers an attractive opportunity to buy the stock. He sees the possibility of the company raising its prices in the fourth quarter in the U.S.\n\nMoreover, Heaney believes the combination of an attractive content slate, including Squid Game 2 and NFL Christmas Day games, and price hikes could fuel further adoption of the company’s ad-tier plan.\n\nWall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on NFLX stock is based on 23 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NFLX stock price target of $704.97 indicates 11.4% upside potential. Shares have risen more than 30% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon shares took a hit after the company’s Q2 revenue missed analysts’ expectations due to sluggish growth in the retail business. In particular, the revenue of AMZN’s North America retail division fell short of expectations due to macro pressures and rising competition.\n\nAmazon Web Service (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit, delivered 19% revenue growth in Q2, while advertising revenue increased 20%. Amazon is optimistic about the prospects of its AWS business, as enterprises continue to shift to the cloud and modernize their infrastructure. AWS is also expected to gain from generative AI-led demand.\n\nIt is interesting to note that while Amazon’s Q2 net sales grew 10%, its EPS jumped 94% year-over-year to $1.26. The bottom line gained from the company’s aggressive cost-efficiency measures and enhanced inventory management.\n\nLooking ahead, Amazon is making significant capital investments to bolster AWS infrastructure so that it can support the solid demand in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\n\nIs Amazon a Buy or Sell Right Now?\n\nWhile several analysts lowered their price targets for Amazon stock to reflect the subdued growth in retail business, Maxim analyst Tom Forte increased the price target to $251 from $238 and reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN stock.\n\nThe analyst noted that while Q2 sales were lower than consensus, the company’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin increased 420 basis points, driven by robust expense control and a favorable mix shift to the cloud.\n\nHe highlighted that AWS’ top-line growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on AWS’ strength, Forte increased his sales and EBIT estimates for FY24 and FY25.\n\nAmazon scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys versus one Hold recommendation. The average AMZN stock price target of $223.58 implies nearly 34% upside potential. Shares have risen about 10% so far this year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Wall Street is highly bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon stocks, it is cautiously optimistic on Netflix. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants.\n\nAmazon’s cost-cutting measures, its dominant position in e-commerce, the massive opportunities for AWS, and the growing advertising business are expected to drive continued growth for the company.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Paramount Global (PARA) announced in a memo to staff Tuesday that it will shut down its storied TV studio by the end of the week — the latest move in a series of aggressive cost cuts the company is taking ahead of its expected merger with Skydance Media.\n\n\"Paramount Global has made the difficult decision to close Paramount Television Studios as part of the company's broader restructuring plans,\" Paramount TV Studios president Nicole Clemens wrote. \"This has been a challenging and transformative time for the entire industry, and sadly, our studio is not immune.\"\n\nParamount's TV studio has produced top series like Netflix's \"Thirteen Reasons Why,\" Amazon's (AMZN) \"Reacher\" and Apple's (AAPL) \"Defending Jacob.\" The stock traded flat on the heels of the news.\n\nClemens will be exiting the company as a result of the shutdown. All current series and development projects will transition to CBS Studios, the company said.\n\n\"To be clear, this is not a decision based on how PTVS performed,\" Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks wrote in a follow-up memo to staff. \"This move is the result of significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplace and the need to streamline our company.\"\n\nLast week, Paramount reported a sharper slowdown than analysts expected in its linear TV business as the company took a nearly $6 billion write-down on the value of its cable unit. At the same time, the media giant announced plans to lay off 15% of its US workforce after eliminating about 800 positions in February.\n\nAccording to a separate internal memo from the company's CEO trio, the layoffs kicked off on Tuesday and will continue in three phases through the end of the year.\n\n\"We expect 90% of these actions to be complete by the end of September,\" Paramount co-CEOs George Cheeks, Brian Robbins, and Chris McCarthy wrote to staff.\n\nThe developments come as the entertainment giant preps its balance sheet for an eventual Skydance takeover, set to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSkydance, which will be valued at $4.75 billion following the all-stock deal's completion, said it would inject $6 billion in cash into Paramount, with $1.5 billion going directly into its debt-ridden balance sheet.\n\nSkydance CEO David Ellison will become chairman and CEO of the combined company, while former NBCUniversal executive Jeff Shell, who was ousted last year over what NBC parent Comcast (CMCSA) deemed an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a female employee, will serve as president.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, the new leadership team laid out their strategic vision for Paramount. This includes $2 billion in cost cuts with $500 million already underway. The latest round of layoffs and restructuring announcements highlighted these efforts.

        "title": "3 High-Potential Stocks to Grab Before Anticipated Rate Cuts",
        "content": "As whispers of interest rate cuts circulate, the investment world is brimming with promise.\n\nWhile global markets have been on the edge, history tells us that the Federal Reserve typically saves emergency rate cuts for full-blown crises, like the 2008 meltdown or the COVID-19 shock. However, the recent uptick in unemployment has sparked significant concern regarding the stability of the U.S. labor market. More and more people are finding themselves without work, whether from temporary layoffs or the persistent challenge of finding new jobs.\n\nAlthough certain experts are betting on a half-point cut in September, the odds of the Fed making a sudden adjustment before then seem slim. In fact, they prefer to see how things play out before making any big moves.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough there might be a few challenges along the way, this could be a golden opportunity to rethink your financial strategy. Consider these three stocks with outstanding upside potential before the anticipated rate cuts to maximize the gains.\n\nInterest Rate Cuts: Amazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has long been a global e-commerce and cloud computing titan. Despite a recent 16.53% dip in share price from its $200 peak, the company’s market stance remains robust. This pullback has definitely piqued investors’ interest in good entry points, given its reputation for long-term growth.\n\nOn the innovation front, Amazon revamped its fulfillment network, which means better margins and more efficiency in North America. Plus, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is booming due to the rising cloud demand and a powerful push into artificial intelligence (AI). It even rolled out new AI chips like Graviton4, which keeps it ahead in the tech game.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon’s knocked it out in its second-quarter financials. Its AWS alone saw sales leap to $26.3 billion, up 19% year-over-year (YOY). Even more impressive is the net income, which more than doubled to a whopping $13.5 billion. With this amazing performance, it’s no surprise Wall Street analysts are all in, assigning a ‘Strong Buy’ with an astonishing 31.8% upside potential.\n\nVisa (V)\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe fintech sector is poised for spectacular expansion. Fortune Business Insights projects sales to rise from $340.10 billion in 2024 to a staggering $1.15 trillion by 2032. Visa (NYSE:V) is well-positioned to profit from this trend. Its unprecedented worldwide network, which connects over 14,500 financial institutions and accepts 4.4 billion cards at more than 130 million merchant locations, offers a distinct advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa’s A+ grade and evergreen profitability profile underpin its strong performance, evidenced by a standout Q3 report. Annually, the company delivered a 12% boost in non-GAAP earnings-per-share (EPS) alongside strong double-digit revenue growth, though it fell slightly short of analysts’ expectations due to softer consumer spending. Still, net income rose by 17% to $4.9 billion, and Visa ended the quarter with a robust 54.7% net profit margin, underscoring its enduring financial strength.\n\nBut that’s not all. With 15 consecutive years of growing dividends, Visa offers capital appreciation and provides a solid income stream for investors. These combined attributes have led Wall Street analysts to assign it a ‘Buy’ rating with a lucrative 16.2% upside potential.\n\nGrab Holdings (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the dominant tech company in Southeast Asia, Grab Holdings (NASDAQ:GRAB) is positioned to leverage the increasing digital adoption. Its all-in-one super app is thriving in these rapidly growing markets. Additionally, the World Economic Forum’s projection of the region’s digital economy reaching $1 trillion by 2030 further cements Grab’s competitive edge.\n\nFinancially, Grab isn’t yet profitable on the bottom line, but the signs of progress are undeniable. The Q1 2024 report reveals a sharp reduction in operating losses, dropping from $204 million to $75 million annually, with a $129 million boost in adjusted EBITDA to an all-time high of 62 million. Moreover, revenue surged a solid 24.4%, beating estimates by $14.47 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Grab’s outlook remains bullish. The company’s market share and Southeast Asia’s tourism growth drive its expansion potential. Wall Street analysts are backing it, too. They have assigned it a ‘Strong Buy’ rating with a stellar 46.6% upside potential.\n\nSo, if you are comfortable with higher risk for the potential of higher rewards, Grab can stay in your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "The tech industry has made many millionaires, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector up 362% since 2014. The index has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index, which rose 179% in the same period. Advances in technology consistently push the market forward, with regular breakthroughs requiring consumers and businesses to update their hardware and software.\n\nAs a result, it's no surprise that four of the five most valuable companies in the world are tech leaders, active in industries such as consumer products, productivity software, chip design, and digital advertising. Burgeoning sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing are currently some of the industry's biggest growth drivers, making their respective market leaders attractive investments.\n\nSo, here are two millionaire-maker technology stocks to buy this August before it's too late.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAfter more than a year of soaring share prices and glowing quarterly earnings, it's probably not surprising that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is on this list. The company's stock is up 132% since last August. Meanwhile, quarterly operating income and free cash flow have climbed 112% and 62%, expanding its cash reserves.\n\nA tech sell-off over the last month brought on by fears of a recession has seen Nvidia's stock fall 16%. However, consistent earnings growth and a dominant role in tech means the dip only strengthens a bullish argument for its stock, creating an opportunity to invest at a reduced price.\n\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, Nvidia posted revenue gains of 262% year over year while operating income soared 492%. The company benefited from significant growth in its data center segment, reflecting a boost in AI graphics processing unit (GPU) sales. Total revenue for the quarter outperformed Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\n\nStellar earnings have become a trend for Nvidia, beating expectations for at least the last four quarters. The company will post its Q2 2025 results on Aug. 28 and will likely follow the recent growth trajectory after glowing results from its chip rival, Advanced Micro Devices, last month. AMD has the second-largest market share in AI chips after Nvidia and delivered a record 115% year-over-year rise in revenue in its data center segment in Q2 2024.\n\nAMD's win proves AI still has much to offer tech companies. And as a leader in the industry with an estimated 80% market share in AI GPUs, Nvidia is a millionaire-maker stock worth buying right now.\n\nNvidia's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is high at 62, yet well below its five-year average of 80. The company's stock rose more than 2,000% with that average, making it a value compared to Nvidia's potential.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered impressive gains over the years, with its stock up nearly 1,000% since 2014. Monster success in e-commerce and cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) has seen its operating income and free cash flow skyrocket by 20,000% and 2,000%, respectively, in that time.  In fact, the company's free cash flow hit more than $48 billion this year, with some analysts speculating that it could be gearing up to release its first dividend.\n\nThanks to its thoroughly diverse business model, the retail giant has become one of the best ways to invest in tech. Consistent reinvestment over the years has seen Amazon diversify its revenue streams and extend its reach with solid positions in online retail, AI, grocery, video streaming, digital advertising, and more.\n\nAmazon's Q2 2024 earnings reflected its diversified business. Revenue increased by 10% year over year after mediocre growth in its retail business. However, total operating income more than doubled from the previous year to $14.6 billion after considerable gains from AWS.\n\nThe company enjoyed impressive gains in its digital businesses during the quarter, with AWS sales climbing 19% year over year and revenue from advertising services increasing by 20%. Amazon's role in tech is swiftly expanding and has become a larger part of its business over the years, exposing the company to markets with attractive profit margins. AWS has granted the company a powerful position in AI. Meanwhile, its streaming service Prime Video gives it a powerful advertising tool and a new growth catalyst.\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon's P/E of 40 is considerably lower than its five-year average of 89. The company has made many millionaires in the past but likely isn't done yet, with its stock a compelling option this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "With the recent global stock market rout fueled by sudden weakness in artificial intelligence companies, it’s an ideal time to consider offloading overhyped AI stocks.\n\nFew expected such a massive tumble at the stock market, but denying how overheated AI stocks had become is tough. AI has been the biggest investing theme over the past few years, driving the stock market to record gains. Yet, many on Wall Street predicted a major correction in AI stocks, with investors demanding tangible AI-driven operational improvements.\n\nConsequently, the Magnificent Seven stocks took a huge hit, wiping out nearly $3 trillion in market value. Moreover, the risks are even greater for investors holding AI stocks with massive or overhyped operating losses. With the possibility of a broader market correction, these overvalued stocks could see major declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, it’s best to prune your portfolio from these high-risk assets AI stocks to sell, offering little upside ahead.\n\nSnap (SNAP)\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP), which operates the Snapchat social media platform, was once a thriving player in the tech space, enjoying its heyday when competition was scarce. However, the social media player has been up against stiff competition with the rise of TikTok and industry titans like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) dominating the space.\n\nOver the past year, Snap’s advertising business has taken a sizeable hit, leading to a significant drop in its top-and-bottom-lines. Additionally, SNAP stock has been down more than 88% in the past three years, including a drop of 47% so far in 2024. Amidst the struggle, it is making major investments in AI and augmented reality.\n\nThe firm’s second-quarter results painted an unattractive picture of its advertising business, triggering a decline in its stock price. While its management was quick to blame the market conditions, the lackluster performance is linked to company-specific issues. Advertising sales were up roughly 10% from a year ago, which pales compared to its peers. Moreover, this underwhelming growth comes when some economic indicators point to a recession, which could weigh down ad spending further.\n\niRobot (IRBT) iRobot (IRBT) Roomba vacuum cleaner robots powerful cleaning system with intelligent sensors to clean Pet hair, crumbs, dirt, and daily dust\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) established a bellwether position in the AI-powered home robotics space. Despite the early burst of excitement surrounding the stock, IRBT shed much value on the back of its dwindling fundamental performance. Moreover, following its stock, it is now trading at a fraction of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) takeover offer following the deal’s collapse earlier this year due to EU regulatory scrutiny.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe fallout has been severe, with iRobot laying off more than 30% of its workforce, underscoring deeper operational challenges. As a stand-alone entity, there’s little to get excited about with iRobot, with sales and profit margins consistently in the red over the past several years.\n\nDespite restructuring efforts, the firm remains in a precarious situation, with its cash position dropping 78% from 2021 to $108.5 million as per its latest quarterly update. Moreover, the intense competition and eroding market share in the robotic vacuum space aggravate the company’s bleak outlook.\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) BigBear.ai (BBAI) is a leading provider of high-speed decision-making technologies. They specialize in AI-driven analytics and solutions for critical missions\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nBigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI)is up against major challenges in the AI sector, with its stock expected to drop further. Despite offering various AI-driven analytics solutions, the company’s financials have taken a turn for the worse.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, BigBear.ai just a 3.4% increase in sales from a year ago, missing estimates of $6.75 million. Moreover the company missed estimates on its top-line for the fifth consecutive quarter. Additionally, it missed bottom-line estimates in three out of the past five quarters.\n\nStrategically, BigBear.ai struggled to hold its own against fierce competition from well-established AI giants and agile startups. Additionally, by acquiring Pangiam Intermediate, BigBear.ai aims to stand out in terms of visual AI and biometrics capabilities.\n\nHowever, these efforts have yet to translate into financial performance. Moreover, its aggressive acquisition strategy has added to its massive debt burden, heightening concerns about dilution. It has a $195 million in long-term debt and just $72 million in cash.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia's Earnings Set For 'Drop The Mic' Moment As Investors Anticipate 'Massive' AI Demand Forecast From CEO Jensen Huang, Says Tech Bull\n\nThe upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be a pivotal moment for the company, according to a prominent analyst.\n\nWhat Happened: Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, predicts that the earnings report, scheduled for Aug. 28, will be a significant event for the tech industry.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. This startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nIves emphasized that the earnings call will capture the attention of investors globally, as they await insights from CEO Jensen Huang on the future demand for artificial intelligence chips through 2025.\n\n“Nvidia earnings on August 28th you will be able to hear a pin drop on trading desks around the Street/globe as investors hear from the Godfather of AI Jensen on the massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025 which we believe will be another drop the mic moment for tech,” Ives wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nNvidia earnings on August 28th you will be able to hear a pin drop on trading desks around the Street/globe as investors hear from the Godfather of AI Jensen on the massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025 which we believe will be another drop the mic moment for tech 🔥\n\n— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) August 12, 2024\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia has seen a significant decline in market value, dropping by $900 billion since its peak in June, despite the ongoing surge in AI spending. Major tech companies like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have committed to continued investment in AI infrastructure, which represents over 40% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the “Magnificent Seven” mega-cap stocks, including Nvidia, have been at the forefront of market volatility. Despite a 30% drop from their five-year peak valuations, they remain 50% above their five-year troughs. This group, which includes major players in IT, communication services, and the electric vehicle industry, continues to wield significant influence over the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFurthermore, notable figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)  have shown confidence in Nvidia’s future by purchasing additional shares. Pelosi recently disclosed acquiring more Nvidia shares while selling part of her stake in Microsoft.\n\nLastly, early tech investor James Anderson has predicted that Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, driven by the growing demand for AI chips. This bullish outlook has contributed to Nvidia’s shares soaring by 117% since the beginning of the year.\n\nPrice Action: Nvidia’s stock closed at $104.75 on Friday, down 0.21% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock inched up 0.019%. Year to date, Nvidia’s stock has surged by an impressive 117.46%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500.

        "content": "Some Amazon workers joined Teamsters members July 22 in a march for better pay and work conditions at Amazon’s Western regional air hub in San Bernardino, California. The union is also campaigning to organize workers at the retailer’s primary air distribution center near Cincinnati. (Photo: Teamsters union)\n\nMembers of the Teamsters union may picket outside Amazon’s national air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) without interference from local officials, a federal judge has ruled.\n\nThe Teamsters have ramped up efforts to organize Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) warehouse workers and drivers ever since securing a major contract win at UPS last summer. The union has spent the past three months trying to win the support of workers at Amazon’s primary air hub as their representative in collective bargaining. Last month it conducted a protest march outside Amazon’s regional air hub in San Bernardino, California, that included some warehouse and ramp workers who the union claimed walked off the job to participate.\n\nJudge Danny Reeves of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky issued a preliminary injunction last week against the Kenton County Airport Board’s denial of a protest request, saying it likely violated Teamsters Local 89’s free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe airport authority said it had turned down the union’s application for permission to demonstrate against Amazon because the public road outside the air hub isn’t approved for expressive activity and that its rules permit a maximum of 10 individuals in any designated area at a given time, according to court documents. CVG airport has several designated protest areas, including two new ones closer to the cargo area, but they aren’t near the Amazon facility.\n\nAbout 75 Teamsters and Amazon workers marched with signs outside the Amazon entrance on July 24, despite the denial of the union’s application.\n\nThe District Court said higher courts have previously determined that public streets are constitutionally protected areas for groups to express their opinions and that there were no safety reasons that justified forcing demonstrators to use the designated protest areas.\n\n“Designated areas for expressive activity are available in the cargo delivery area at some distance from Amazon’s entrance, but the defendants concede that the plaintiff’s intended audience would be reduced by utilizing these sites. Further, there is no question that limiting the number of picketers to ten reduces the impact of the plaintiff’s message,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Teamsters have filed unfair labor charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Amazon has resisted unionization efforts. Amazon has steadfastly fought all efforts to unionize its workforce around the country.\n\n“This is a significant victory for Amazon workers in Northern Kentucky and around the country who are sick of being silenced by this trillion-dollar corporation. Amazon workers everywhere are coming together to become Teamsters and win the rights and protections they deserve,” said Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien in a news release.  “You can be sure the Teamsters will carry this precedent to other communities around the country where Amazon is exploiting loopholes and breaking laws to take advantage of workers and inflate its bottom line. Our union of 1.3 million hardworking members applaud the court for doing the right thing in this case.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCVG is a critical part of Amazon’s ability to provide one-and-two day delivery for Amazon Prime members.\n\nAfter initially borrowing space from DHL Express, Amazon opened its own $1.5 billion facility at CVG three years ago. Flights at CVG increased from 57.5 to 63.3 per day in the past 12 months, not including flights by unmarked partner carriers, according to a March report from researchers at DePaul University.\n\nThe Teamsters conducted a one-day “strike” outside Amazon’s Western Region air hub at San Bernardino International Airport on July 22 to complain about alleged retaliation against workers for attempting to unionize and the need for better pay and work conditions.\n\nUnder federal labor law, workers don’t need to belong to a recognized labor union to strike.\n\nThe Amazon Labor Union, a grassroots organization that won a 2022 vote to unionize 5,500 workers at a giant Amazon facility in Staten Island, agreed in June to affiliate with the Teamsters.\n\nAbout 1,100 DHL Express workers at CVG agreed to a contract early this year after joining the Teamsters union in 2023 and going on strike for 12 days in December.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nDHL Express workers at Cincinnati airport reach deal, end strike\n\nThe post Teamsters can protest at Amazon air hub, federal court says appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy the 3 Worst Nasdaq 100 Stocks Since the Tech Sector Selloff?",
        "content": "The tech sector selloff that began in July gave investors the jitters. The best tech stocks were in freefall after carrying the Nasdaq 100 to new heights. In fact, the index is still in correction territory as it is down more than 10% from its all-time high.\n\nSome of the leading names in the tech industry also remain lower by double-digit percentages. They might still be up by large amounts for the year, but Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is down 13% since the Nasdaq selloff, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 14% lower and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down almost 18%. Yet, they weren’t the worst Nasdaq 100 stocks. Quite a few companies fared even worse.\n\nIs this just a temporary setback, or is the rotation out of tech names and more small-cap positions a trend that will continue? Let’s take a closer look at the three worst Nasdaq 100 stocks that are down 40% on average from just one month ago to see whether you should buy them at these deeply discounted prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDexCom (DXCM) DexCom headquarters in San Diego, CA, USA. DexCom, Inc. is a company that manufactures glucose monitoring systems. DXCM stock\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical device maker DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) focuses primarily on the Type 1 diabetes market. Its continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have been the leading product in the space for years, and it was looking to gain a foothold in the larger Type 2 diabetes market. Yet, DexCom stumbled hard in the second quarter, sending its stock crashing.\n\nRevenue rose 15% to $1 billion, just missing analyst expectations. However, it handily beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share, reporting adjusted profits of 43 cents. But what caused DXCM stock to plummet 40% was management slashing its full-year sales outlook. It previously guided toward revenue of $4.2 to $4.35 billion. Now it says to expect $4 to $4.05 billion, or $200 to $300 million less.\n\nDexCom is experiencing significantly fewer patient starts than previously expected. It had 70,000 fewer new patients starts globally in Q2, or 25% fewer than what management forecast. While executives also see Q3 being down, it should regain its previous level in Q4.

INTC stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is falling further behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race. The outlook for ever catching up seems bleak. Sales are falling, profits evaporated and Intel just said it was cutting over 15,000 jobs to control costs. Also, its dividend is now a thing of the past. The chipmaker eliminated the payout to further save money. There is little reason to wonder why INTC stock is down 43% since the tech selloff began.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel’s problems are structural. Although being vertically integrated should offer the chipmaker efficiencies and economies, it is not working out like that. Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Broadcom farm out the chip manufacturing process to third parties. Intel is also a foundry and owning the means of production comes at a cost. It is looking to save $10 billion in costs in 2025.\n\nWall Street has now drastically revised its outlook. Where analysts had been looking for $1.08 per share in earnings, they now see just 27 cents. They are looking for a drop in sales too, down to $52.3 billion. Investors should stay away from Intel stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe worst Nasdaq 100 stock is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). It’s stock is down 42% since the tech selloff began. While it was one of the best performers beforehand, and the stock is still up over 80% in 2024, earnings also did in the AI server maker.\n\nWhile second-quarter revenue rocketed 144% higher to $5.3 billion, its results showed profit margins were dramatically compressing. Gross margins narrowed 580 basis points to just 11.2%, indicating its expenses were significantly rising. As competition in the space is keen, Super Micro seemingly wanted to maintain its market share and didn’t pass along its higher input costs to its customers.\n\nThe impact was felt on the bottom line as adjusted earnings per share shot 78% higher to $6.25 per share but that was way short of Wall Street’s forecast for $8.07 per share.\n\nAlthough management thinks it can get margins back up toward its previous levels, it is not the easy path it once looked like. Wall Street now sees revenue growth quickly decelerating. It forecasts a 77% jump this year to $26.5 billion but then it falls off a cliff in fiscal 2026. Analysts project just 19% growth that year to $31.64 billion.\n\nWhenever a company is expected to see growth falter, investors would be wise to sit on the sidelines until the dust settles.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Beaten-Down Growth Stocks to Scoop Up on the Dip",
        "content": "Many growth stocks have posted stellar figures in recent quarters and rallied significantly of late. However, the party seems to be over for many such companies. Indeed, momentum has reversed as the market turns bearish on the valuations many growth stocks have achieved. And increasingly, investors are scrutinizing tech stocks more closely. In fact, some growth names haven’t joined in on this recent rally and have seen little to no bullish price action.\n\nI believe this recent dip presents a prime opportunity to scoop up shares of beaten-down growth stocks on the cheap. While the market may be souring on growth stocks as a whole, certain companies still have robust underlying businesses that could deliver solid results over the long run. That’s true, even in a tougher economic environment.\n\nHere are three such beaten-down growth stocks to look into right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDellTechnologies (NYSE:DELL) has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past year. However, like many tech and AI stocks, DELL stock has seen some less-than-impressive price action of late. The broader market is still showing signs of uncertainty, so there hasn’t been any momentum to drive the stock back toward new highs.\n\nHowever, I believe this recent dip could provide a decent entry point for long-term investors. The stock is down 43% from its highs back in May, and I think that it’s been over-punished and shouldn’t trade at these levels.\n\nDell is the global leader in the server market, with approximately 20% market share. The AI server market is expected to grow to around $430 billion by 2033. Therefore, there is plenty of room for growth going forward.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Dell posted revenue of $22.24 billion, beating estimates by $591.79 million. However, the company did unfortunately miss on the bottom line, providing $1.27 of earnings per share, which missed by 2 cents. Currently, analysts hold an average price target of $163 on DELL stock.\n\nWhile the company’s recent layoffs may raise some eyebrows, Dell’s increased focus on AI could position it well for the future. It’s a top growth stock I think is being overlooked right now.\n\nRoku (ROKU) ROKU Stock Will Continue Benefitting From the TCL Partnership\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) operates a popular streaming platform, providing access to online video content. The company has faced challenges in recent years. Indeed, the performance of ROKU stock has reflected these concerns, trading sideways between $50 and $100 per share for most of the past year. Notably, the stock dipped as low as $40 in late-2022 amidst the broader tech selloff.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, I believe Roku’s current price (around $55 per share) offers compelling upside potential. As the company turns the corner to solid profitability, there’s a lot to like about its upside potential. In Q2 2024, Roku delivered an impressive 20% growth in streaming hours and a 14% increase in active accounts to 83.6 million. Platform revenue, encompassing ads, original content, and services, rose 11% to $824 million. And device sales surged 39% to $144 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Roku expects to surpass $1 billion in quarterly revenue and is targeting accelerating growth heading into 2025. With more than $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet, I view Roku’s financial position as quite secure. I think the company can easily handle its pace of operating losses going forward. Beaten-down growth stocks: ROKU Revenue, EBIT, cash estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile some analysts worry about competition from tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Roku continues to grow faster than rivals like Vizio (NYSE:VIZO). I think you’d be wise to consider scooping up some shares of this beaten-down growth stock before the market recognizes Roku’s long-term potential.\n\nLyft (LYFT) The Lyft (LYFT) logo on the side of a pink car parked on a street.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nLyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) operates a ride-hailing service in the United States and Canada. Its stock price has declined more than 18% after missing Q2 bookings estimates and providing weak guidance. That’s despite the company achieving its first-ever GAAP profitable quarter. End consumers see Lyft as just an Uber (NYSE:UBER) alternative, and most investors see the same. Uber has kept both investors and users very happy during the rally, so why switch? As such, Lyft has gotten the short end of the stick and appears much less relevant for many investors.\n\nHowever, I believe Lyft is becoming too oversold at current levels. The recent selloff has pushed LYFT stock below $10 per share as of writing. However, I think this discounted stock price provides significant upside potential, given Lyft’s strong Q2 numbers. Revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $1.44 billion, beating estimates. The company also beat on the bottom line, reporting 24 cents of earnings per share. These numbers were driven by key metrics such as active riders and total rides, which hit all-time highs.\n\nYes, Lyft’s weak Q3 gross bookings guidance of $4.0-$4.1 billion missed the $4.15 billion consensus. But at the stock’s current valuation of around 13-times forward earnings, I believe this guidance is more than priced in. You’d be hard-pressed to find another profitable growth stock trading at such a low multiple. Honestly, that guidance miss isn’t that bad, and Lyft could easily surpass those numbers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba BABA is leaving no stone unturned to boost technological innovation driven by generative AI.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Alibaba’s recent launch of Qwen2-Math, a group of maths-specific large language models (LLMs), remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe latest models, built on the Qwen2 LLM, are designed to improve reasoning capabilities in solving complex mathematical problems.\r\n\r\nAlibaba aims to gain solid popularity among students and mathematicians on the back of Qwen2-Math.\r\n\r\nThe latest move will also add strength to Alibaba’s cloud computing unit.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Statista report, the generative AI market is expected to hit $36.06 billion in 2024 and reach $356.10 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 46.5% between 2024 and 2030. Alibaba is well-positioned to capitalize on this solid growth opportunity on the back of its expanding generative AI-backed offerings.\r\n\r\nAlibaba unveiled the “AI programmer,” powered by the company’s in-house LLM. The AI programmer combines software architect, development engineer and test engineer roles to help developers shorten application development times, sometimes to minutes.\r\n\r\nThe company also updated Model Studio, its AI model and application development platform, to offer a wider range of models and sophisticated AI tools. Developers can now access more than 100 models from AI companies like Baichuan AI, and the platform also incorporates an open-source framework for application development.\r\n\r\nAlibaba is currently leveraging generative AI technology to strengthen its global marketplaces, including AliExpress and Lazada. It is using AI-powered tools to assist cross-border merchants with translation, content creation and product returns.\r\n\r\nAlibaba’s launch of its AI programming assistant, Tongyi Lingma, remains noteworthy. It enhances software development efficiency, reducing test code implementation time by over 70% and saving developers hours of manual work.\r\n\r\nAlibaba’s growing generative AI efforts are expected to boost its long-term prospects. \r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 total revenues stands at $141.05 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 8.1%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BABA’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.20 per share, indicating an 4.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.\n\nStiff Competition Hurts Alibaba\n\nHowever, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company faces stiff competition in the generative AI market from players like Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL, which are making concerted efforts to strengthen their dominance in the market.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAlibaba’s shares have gained 5.4% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s return of 6.8%. BABA shares have underperformed Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet’s gain of 8.4%, 9.9% and 17.3%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft introduced new generative AI and data solutions for retailers, enabling personalized shopping experiences, empowering store associates, and unifying retail data. These solutions include Azure OpenAI Service copilot templates, retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights copilot features and Retail Media Creative Studio.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Amazon is riding on its AI-powered assistant, Amazon Q, allowing conversations, problem-solving, content generation, and insights. It connects to company information repositories, code, data, and enterprise systems, promoting task efficiency, decision-making and innovation.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google recently launched three new open generative AI models, Gemma 2 2B, ShieldGemma and Gemma Scope, which are part of Google's Gemma 2 family. Gemma 2 2B is a lightweight text analysis model licensed for research and commercial applications, while Gemma Scope allows developers to zoom in on specific points within a model. ShieldGemma is a safety classifier that detects toxicity in content.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Last week was pretty ho-hum if you zoom out. The major market averages were essentially flat. Zoom in, and you get wild volatility. Last week contained the largest single-day drop -- and single-day rise -- of the year. This is the kind of uptick in volatility that makes Ark Invest co-founder, CEO, and chief investment officer Cathie Wood more pecking than usual.\n\nWood was actively buying and selling stocks last week. She added to her existing positions in Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN), Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), and Guardant Health (NASDAQ: GH) on Friday. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe leading online retailer was the belle of the buying ball on Friday. Wood raised her stake in Amazon in five of the six Ark Invest growth stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The stock has fallen nearly 10% since posting disappointing second-quarter results earlier this month.\n\nAmazon did get better during the last six trading days since the uninspiring financial update. It announced late last week that it was teaming up with TikTok to make it easier for influencers on the short-form video platform to make some money by promoting products sold on Amazon. The partnership will allow TikTok's massive audience to buy promoted Amazon products without leaving the video app. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's fair to say that Amazon's latest quarter wasn't great. Revenue rose a weaker-than-expected 10% in the second quarter, and its guidance calling for an 8% to 11% increase is more of the same. It was a different story at the other end of the income statement, with earnings per share more than doubling to land ahead of Wall Street profit targets. However, Amazon's slowest year-over-year top-line growth in more than a year is not a good look for a stock that hit an all-time high earlier this summer.\n\nThis is also more than just an e-commerce company. Its huge Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-hosting platform accounted for 89% of the operating profit in its latest quarter. That's some lush greenery. Picking up shares at a nearly 10% discount to where they were six trading days ago -- and 17% off the all-time high it scored just last month -- doesn't seem like a bad idea for long-term believers in Amazon's reign and forest.\n\n2. Roku\n\nRoku is another stock trading lower after announcing fresh financials earlier this month, but this markdown seems even more unfair. The TV streaming pioneer exceeded expectations on all fronts with its second-quarter report. It was a \"beat and raise\" performance, as guidance also surpassed analyst forecasts.\n\nThe platform's popularity continues to grow, and not just because it has now posted double-digit revenue growth for five consecutive quarters. Roku is reaching 83.6 million streaming households, an increase of 14% over the past year. The number of hours streamed on the platform surged 20%. So, once again, we see engagement on the rise as usage is outpacing Roku's audience growth.\n\nRoku's still in the red on a reported basis, but the losses are narrowing. Trailing free cash flow is in the nine figures, so it's not as if the company isn't a money maker. Its namesake Roku Channel has been particularly resilient, with streaming on that free ad-supported channel soaring 75% over the past year.\n\n3. Guardant Health\n\nShares of Guardant Health declined 4% on Friday, making it the worst performer of these three Wood purchases on the day. There wasn't bad news put out on the developer of oncological tests. It actually posted blowout financial results earlier in the week. It exceeded top- and bottom-line expectations in its latest quarter, boosting its full-year revenue guidance in the process.\n\nGuardant has a limited number of products currently available for clinical or biopharmaceutical tests, but its pipeline is growing more attractive. It has a colorectal cancer screening tool -- Shield -- that is getting close to clearing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory hurdle for approval. It would join Guardant360 -- a portfolio of liquid and tissue precision oncology tests -- in the market, ramping up its growth potential.\n\nGuardant doesn't expect to be profitable until 2028, but patience could pay off for long-term investors. Guardant also sees its revenue more than tripling to $2 billion by then. Sometimes, the best growth stories take time to play out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Do Options Traders Know Something About Amazon (AMZN) Stock We Don't?",
        "content": "Investors in Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 20, 2024 $45.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amazon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Commerce industry that ranks in the Top 25% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.18 per share to $1.15 in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Amazon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "Shopify Has Gotten Its Mojo Back As It Flexes Its Pricing Power Muscles",
        "content": "Shopify Has Gotten Its Mojo Back As It Flexes Its Pricing Power Muscles\n\nOn Wednesday, Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP) topped estimates with its second quarter results. The Canadian e-commerce rival of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY) and Wayfair Inc (NYSE: W) enjoyed strong demand despite “a mixed consumer spend environment.” Its rival Etsy missed estimates with second quarter net income and pulled its fourth quarter guidance because of an unpredictable macroenvironment. Etsy also sees the upcoming election to be another distraction for the weakened consumer. Even the mighty e-commerce titan such as Amazon spoke of a cautious consumer as its online sales were a bit short of estimates. Although Amazon reported its online sales grew 5%, growth has slowed down from previous quarter’s 7% growth rate. Last but not least, even Amazon provided a cautious guidance.\n\nSecond quarter financials For the quarter ended on June 30th, Shopify reported  revenue grew 20.7% to $2 billion, fueled by more spending on Shopify powered commerce websites with gross merchandise volume rising 22% YoY.\n\nRising from 58% from last year’s comparable quarter, 61% of Shopify's payment volume is now processed by its internal payment systems, which come with a higher take rate.\n\nShopify hiked prices of monthly subscription fees, and a testament of its impressive pricing power subscription is the fact that revenue grew 26.8% YoY to $563 million.\n\nWhat is perhaps most impressive is the fact Shopify significantly improved its profitability while investing in its growth. Over the past year, the operating margin reached the positive shore after last year’s losses and free cash flow margin more than doubled on a YoY basis as it amounted to 16%. During the quarter, Shopify generated more $333 million, which means it generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.\n\nShopify reported a second quarter net income of $171 million or 13 cents per diluted share while adjusted earnings amounted to 26 cents per share.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nShopify guided for YoY revenue growth from low-to-mid-20s percentages. FactSet analysts expected YoY growth of 21% YoY to $2.07 billion.\n\nThe macroeconomic is challenging, but Shopify is doing a good job at navigating it.\n\nLike Amazon, Etsy and Wayfair, Shopify also noted consumers being cautious about their spending. But with a diverse set of businesses, its merchants managed to navigate the slowdown.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 Retail Stocks Poised for a Comeback After Last Week’s Market Meltdown",
        "content": "Last week was one of the worst weeks for the market this year. The S&P 500 was up more than 15% this year prior to the meltdown. Yet, this last July happened to be the worst July in the past 10 years of market history. Despite the meltdown, some retail stocks are showing a bit of promise.\n\nThere are a number of things that led to this market meltdown. First, the employment data revealed that the job market was not as strong as we expected. Out of the 180,000 anticipated new jobs, only 114,000 were added to the labor market in July. This resulted in the highest unemployment rate since October 2021. Another reason for a market meltdown was the Yen carry trade. Historically, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept extremely low interest rates. This motivated American investors to borrow money from Japan and invest in U.S. dollars with higher interest rates. When BOJ quickly raised its interest rate last month, the Yen appreciated and American yen shorters took a massive hit.\n\nHowever, on the other side, a market meltdown presents a phenomenal opportunity to buy stocks. This is especially true for long-term investors who are willing to wait. Below are the three retail stocks to buy before they bounce back again.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHot Retail Stocks: Amazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe miracle growth story of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well known. However, the question is whether the e-commerce giant can continue its success in the future. This is especially a hot topic as a lot of the mega tech companies took a major hit in the past month. While there is certainly market volatility and the second quarter earnings proved to be a disappointment to many investors, there is still so much growth potential in the company in the upcoming years. This is backed up by many analysts’ ratings. Even though Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan slightly reduced the price target, they both still kept an overweight rating just last week.\n\nDespite rising competition in e-commerce, like Walmart in the retail industry, there is no one that will overtake Amazon in e-commerce. As of writing, the stock is down almost 15% this past month, and there is no better time to buy Amazon than right now.\n\nLululemon (LULU) the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wall\n\nSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com\n\nLululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) is trading at its 52-week low, and the stock is essentially down back to its pre-pandemic price. This year alone, the stock has more than halved, and while it might seem like there is no hope left after years of decline, I would argue that Lululemon might be ready for a surprising comeback in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nLulu grew in popularity and dominated the athletic apparel market over the past few years, but as the competition increased, Lululemon has struggled to keep up with its rapid growth.\n\nIf you are only looking at Lulu’s domestic sales, you will find it a disappointment. However, if we are talking about international sales, it becomes a completely different story. In the latest earnings report, Lulu revealed that revenues in the U.S. only went up by 3% year-over-over while international net revenue grew by 35% in that same timeframe. This is primarily due to the 25% increase in global sales Lululemon experienced. While the initial Lulu hype might be gone in the U.S., there is still a lot of room for growth abroad, making Lululemon a good stock to buy on the dip.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) An image of a Dick's Sporting Goods retail location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is another stock that took a hit from the recent market plunge. The stock is up more than 40% this year as of writing, but last month, it took a 7% dip. But unlike other retailers, this appears to be a short-term volatility, and DKS will most likely bounce back soon, which makes it a good buy opportunity.\n\nIn terms of financials, the company looks strong. According to the latest earnings report released in May, Dick’s Sporting Goods beat the analysts’ earnings per share (EPS) expectation by 0.35 cents at $3.30. Revenue reached $3.02 billion, which is a 6% increase from the previous year. This was primarily driven by increased consumer spending on athletic apparel and items.\n\nFollowing the positive earnings report from the first quarter, Dick’s Sporting Goods adjusted its guidance for the full year. The sporting company now expects $13.1 to $13.2 billion in total revenue this year.

        "title": "Walmart, Home Depot, Target and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 12, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Home Depot HD, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nRetail Earnings Loom: A Preview\n\nWalmart shares held their own in the market’s recent turmoil, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning. With the company on deck to report quarterly results on Thursday, August 15th, Walmart’s results will provide us with an important window into the health of the consumer economy. Worries about the economy and recession risks were a big driver of the market sell-off.\n\nThis week also brings quarterly results from Home Depot on Tuesday, August 13th. But Home Depot is primarily a housing play, which has been struggling lately due to higher mortgage rates.\n\nIn addition to Walmart and Home Depot, we will also get the July inflation and Retail Sales readings, with the CPI report coming on Wednesday, August 14th, and the Retail Sales report the same morning as Walmart’s release (Thursday).\n\nThe inflation report has been the market’s primary preoccupation in recent months, given its significance to the coming Fed easing that is widely expected to get underway in September. In the wake of the recent market turmoil, many expect that the central bank will opt for a bigger magnitude of cut at the September meeting than would have been the case otherwise.\n\nThe inflation trend has been favorable over the last couple of months after coming out on the hot side in the first few months of the year. The Retail Sales reading will most likely get much more scrutiny this time, given the market’s focus on the economy’s growth momentum, which has notably eased in recent months.\n\nGetting back to Walmart’s quarterly release, please see below how Walmart shares performed relative to the Home Depot, the S&P 500 index, and the Magnificent 7 stocks.\n\nWalmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under growing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.65 in EPS on $168.4 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.6% and +4.2%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, though management had pointed to some early signs of stabilization in a few discretionary product categories at the last earnings call. Any favorable turn in the demand trends for the retailer’s discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\n\nThe chart below uses a longer time span than the four-week period we used earlier, with the one-year performance of Walmart relative to Home Depot, Mag 7, and the S&P 500 index.\n\nWalmart shares were up big following the last quarterly release on May 15th, which was the second quarter in a row of market participants cheering the retailer’s quarterly results. One relatively less noted part of Walmart’s growing digital footprint is the retailer’s growing advertising business. It is still a relatively small part of Walmart’s total revenues, but this revenue stream is growing fast and enjoys a much higher margin.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 23 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +26.2% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 52.2% beating EPS estimates and only 34.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\n\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top- line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart)\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q2 earnings calls, as we did from Amazon, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 2nd, we have seen Q2 results from 456 S&P 500 members, or 91.2% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +9.1% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating EPS estimates and only 59% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have seen results from more than 90% of S&P 500 members already. This week brings in results from more than 400 companies, including 8 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include the aforementioned Walmart and Home Depot, Brinker International, Cisco Systems, Tapestry, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, Applied Materials, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). Revenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows.\n\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods.\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.3% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July.\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter got underway. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are going up, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.2% on +1.7% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -11.1% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.8%.\n\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.1% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.9% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nUnlike the calendar year view that the above chart shows, the chart below the earnings data on a rolling four-quarter basis\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>A Closer Look At the Current Earnings Picture\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Why Is It the Best Self Driving Car Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\n\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\n\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let’s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\n\nThe Global Autonomous Vehicle Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\n\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\n\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\n\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\n\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest Trends in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry\n\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\n\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates in the retail sale of consumer products in North America and internationally. The company also offers Amazon Web Services and manufactures and sells electronic devices. The stock was held by 302 hedge funds in Q1 2024, with total stakes worth $60.37 billion. Diamond Hill Capital is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $474.3 million.\n\nThe company expanded its operations in the autonomous vehicle segment when it acquired Zoox in 2020. Since then the company has made significant strides in autonomous vehicles and is developing fully autonomous robot taxis. Zoox unlocked a key milestone in February 2023, when it released its fully automated robot taxi on the roads of Foster City, California. Unlike its competitors, Zoox taxis are completely autonomous and have space for 4 adult passengers.\n\nMoreover, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also plays a critical role in developing and deploying Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). AWS offers a range of solutions tailored for the autonomous mobility industry, enabling companies to develop, test, and deploy their self-driving technologies efficiently. The company has entered into notable strategic partnerships with BMW, Lyft and Toyota for data processing, machine learning, and simulation capabilities.\n\nThe company posted a successful second quarter of 2024. Net sales of the company increased 11% year-over-year to reach $148 billion. Net sales were driven by strong growth in the AWS segment and grew 19% year-over-year to reach $26.3 billion. The AWS segment, which also provides ADAS to automotive companies, was able to grow its operational income by 7.2% subsequently reaching $9.3 billion.\n\nWhat sets Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) apart from its competitors is its robust cloud infrastructure, which provides scalable computing power, storage, and advanced data analytics capabilities. For instance, Amazon EC2 enables high-performance computing, Amazon S3 allows data storage, and Amazon SageMaker service has accelerated the autonomous driving capabilities of its subsidiary Zoox.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has grown its top line by 22% and bottom line by 74% during the last 10 years. 65 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, with their 12-month median price target of $220 presenting an upside of 32% from current levels.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best self driving car stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Powered by Nvidia and AI, humanoid ambitions take shape",
        "content": "When the Department of Defense commenced its robotics challenge in 2015, the stated goal was to develop ground robots that can aid in disaster recovery with the help of human operators. Each android was given an hour to complete eight tasks, which included driving a car and climbing some stairs.\n\nNearly a decade later, generative AI is accelerating that learning curve, pushing human-like machines to pick up new tasks in real time.\n\n“The holy grail for us is what we call zero-shot learning, or the ability to show the robot what to do, and it can do it the same way that you do that task,” said Jeff Cardenas, co-founder of Apptronik, an Austin-based robotics maker.\n\nThat vision is slowly becoming reality. Last week, OpenAI-backed Figure unveiled the latest iteration of its humanoid robot. The robot is equipped with a vision language model that allows the machine to reason visually and self-correct learned behavior, according to the company’s claims.\n\nAnd in June, Tesla (TSLA) presented an updated version of its Optimus robot at Tesla’s Investor Day and showed it roaming a factory floor. CEO Elon Musk touted the robot’s potential, saying it had the ability to push the company’s market cap to $25 trillion. Tesla's humanoid robot is displayed at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China, on July 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nRobotics have been integrated into factory floors and warehouses to improve efficiencies for years. But current machines in use have largely been limited to moving from point A to point B and tackling a handful of tasks.\n\nHumanoids that can adapt to existing environments have long been seen as the ultimate test if they can work alongside humans in spaces built for them.\n\n“If you want a versatile robot, then having a robot that can retrofit into our environment so you don’t have to change anything seems important,” said Cardenas. “Today, three to six [times] the price of the robot is spent just integrating that robot into a new workflow.”\n\nNvidia humanoid ambition\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is driving rapid development through an ecosystem built specifically for humanoids. It combines high-powered chips that process data at high speeds with the omniverse, a digital world that allows users to train robots on skills applied in the real world.\n\nThe company announced the development of AI foundation models earlier this year. Just last month, Nvidia unveiled “NIM Microservices,” a visual training ground that allows generative AI models to visually interpret their surroundings in 3D.\n\n“Before, when we used to do an AI model for doing a particular task, we had to train it with specific data for that task … and if you needed that AI model to do something different, you needed to retrain that model,” said Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president of Robotics and Edge Computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s ecosystem now enables robots to train using text and speech input, in addition to live demonstrations. Apollo, the humanoid robot, completes tasks in a kitchen. (Apptronik) (Apptronik)\n\nThose advancements have helped supercharge development at Apptronik, one of a handful of robotics companies Nvidia has partnered with. The company recently achieved a big milestone at its Austin headquarters when its humanoid robot, Apollo, autonomously performed tasks trained through visual learning. The machine was seen picking up a pair of socks and a hat and packing it into a box. A task that once took thousands of hours to train on took just 10 hours, according to the company.\n\n“If we build big data sets of humans doing tasks in these environments and we have robots with the same morphology as a person, then that allows us to have robots that can do a whole wide range of tasks over time,” said Cardenas.\n\nThat potential has attracted record funding from investors. Humanoid robotics companies raised nearly $793 million in the first half of 2024, according to data from CB Insights.\n\nGoldman Sachs projects the android market will reach $38 billion by 2035.\n\n“If you have a robot that can really do anything a human can, then that fundamentally changes the economy as we know it, right?” said Sam Korus, director of Research, Autonomous Technology, and Robotics at Ark Invest. “Then there’s no more constraint on human labor.”\n\nTech leaders have been quick to caution that more humanoids won’t necessarily mean fewer human jobs. However, a report by Goldman Sachs estimates the machines are likely to substitute people in 5% to 15% of existing jobs in car manufacturing as well as in dangerous jobs, such as disaster rescue and nuclear reactor work. That demand is likely to push 1.1 million to 3.5 million units globally, according to the report.\n\nHumanoids have already begun taking their first steps into reality. Musk has said two Optimus robots are working at Tesla’s Fremont factory, and he expects a few thousand to be deployed by next year. Amazon (AMZN) has partnered with Oregon-based Agility to utilize its Digit robot at a test facility. Apptronik is working with Mercedes-Benz to integrate Apollo into its manufacturing line.\n\nTalla sees a humanoid future beyond industrial use. He expects androids to become as ubiquitous as smartphones and EVs, if companies are able to scale and bring costs down to $10,000 per machine.\n\n“It needs to be economical, it needs to be intelligent, and it needs to be safe,” he said. “If those three conditions are met, then there’s no reason why every home should not have at least one humanoid or more.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon is an important part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Paul Singer believes might be in a bubble.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company’s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying.

        "title": "Prediction: This CEO of a Boeing and Lockheed Joint Venture Sees Billions of Dollars in His Future",
        "content": "In November 2024, Tory Bruno, CEO of space giant United Launch Alliance (ULA), had reason to be thankful.\n\nSeveral years prior, Bruno had promised investors he would lower the cost of rockets manufactured by ULA, a joint venture between Boeing(NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT), and price ULA rocket launches competitively with rockets launched by SpaceX. In November, he delivered on that promise, winning 11 U.S. Space Force launch contracts for $118 million each. SpaceX, meanwhile, won 10 launch contracts at an average cost of $120 million.\n\nAdvantage: ULA.\n\nSpace math: What's $118 million times 23?\n\nIt's been a long time since ULA prices were anywhere near competitive with SpaceX prices, but now that they are, ULA is making the most of its opportunity. In a short boast posted on Twitter last month, Bruno revealed that ULA currently has 23 new Vulcan Centaur rockets under construction at its Alabama rocket factory.\n\nAnother #VulcanRocket departs Alabama and heads to Florida, making room in our crowded rocket factory. 23 Vulcans in production!!! pic.twitter.com/CIfBl8yKMS\n\n-- Tory Bruno (@torybruno) July 26, 2024\n\nAt $118 million per launch, that implies ULA is laying the groundwork to generate $2.7 billion in revenue with these rockets.\n\nThe question investors may ask is whether ULA can find enough customers for all these rockets. After all, so far this decade, ULA has launched only 20 rockets, including five launches in 2021, eight in 2022, but just three in 2023 (and four so far this year). What's more, almost all of these launches had just one customer: the U.S. government. So few launches, servicing such a small customer base, suggests ULA may be overproducing for a market that doesn't exist. But here's the thing: The market does exist.\n\nTwo years ago, Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) tapped ULA to support its effort to build a Kuiper satellite communications network around Earth. And the 23 rockets ULA is building today are only a part of that effort. In all, Amazon has hired ULA to launch 47 times for it as part of Project Kuiper, giving ULA its first real shot at becoming a commercial launch contractor, as opposed to just a launcher of government and military satellites.\n\nThanks largely to Amazon, therefore, Bruno now anticipates that ULA will launch as often in 2025 as it has launched in all of this decade so far -- 20 times -- and accelerate to \"25+\" launches per year after that.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven on time spacecraft deliveries, 20 next year and 25+ the following\n\n-- Tory Bruno (@torybruno) July 26, 2024\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nAnd so it turns out that this story is even bigger than just \"23 rockets\" generating $2.7 billion in revenue once. It's a story of ULA transforming itself to roughly quadruple its launch cadence so it can consistently generate annual revenues of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion from launch operations alone.\n\nAt the same time, ULA may have reached an inflection point in the profit margins it earns on those revenues. According to a February report by Payload Space, from 2016 to 2023, ULA profits collapsed 88% -- from $650 million to just $80 million. 75% of this decline was from a slowing in launch cadence (from 12 launches in 2016 to three in 2023). The rest came from lower profit margins -- but this may be changing.\n\nWhile ULA is privately owned and does not release detailed information about its financial performance, its 50% part-owner, Lockheed Martin, does. And according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin space division profit margins, which were 13.2% in 2016 and fell to 8.9% by 2023, rebounded to a solid 10% in the first six months of 2024. If we use Lockheed's performance as a proxy for ULA's, therefore, it would appear that at the same time that ULA's revenues are starting to improve, so too are its profits!\n\nSo what does this mean for investors in Boeing and Lockheed? One possibility is that more profit will soon be flowing from ULA onto the parent companies' income statements.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "With shares down almost 20% in the last 30 days, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AI-powered rally is beginning to falter. There are also concerns that a potential economic slowdown could hurt its consumer-driven business model. Let's explore how these near-term challenges could affect the stock's performance over the next three years and beyond.\n\nRecession fears mount\n\nIt is impossible to predict the future, but investors should pay attention to macroeconomic factors that could affect their thesis. For Amazon and other consumer-goods-focused companies, the main near-term threat could be a recession, which many economists see as more likely after the July unemployment rate (4.3%) came in higher than expected.\n\nWhen people lose their jobs, they have less money to spend on online shopping, which leans toward discretionary items over necessities. However, the good news is that Amazon's customers still look strong.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue increased 10% year over year to $148 billion, driven by expansion in North American and international e-commerce.\n\nBoth segments are relatively mature, so investors shouldn't expect explosive growth in the future. However, Amazon has focused on juicing profitability through workforce reductions and supply chain efficiency, and these efforts are bearing fruit. Operating income increased 59% to $5.1 billion for North America, while the international segment jumped from a loss of around $900 million to a gain of around $300 million.\n\nNew growth and profitability drivers\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce business has transitioned into a stable cash cow, new segments will help power the next leg of long-term growth. Following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-related demand has boosted the company's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS focuses on the infrastructure side of the AI opportunity, offering clients pre-trained AI services like Amazon Rekognition (which helps with image recognition and video analysis) or Amazon Macie, designed to use machine learning to protect clients' sensitive data.\n\nAmazon also boasts a foundational large language model (LLM) called Bedrock, which allows clients to create customized conversational algorithms in the same vein as ChatGPT, but trained on their own data. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon's picks-and-shovels take on AI could shield it from some of the competition on the consumer-facing side of the opportunity. And the fact that these new AI offerings are integrated into the AWS platform could serve as an economic moat by making AWS a one-stop shop for all of a client's cloud-related needs. Segment revenue jumped 19% year over year to $26.3 billion, while operating income surged 72% to $9.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat might we expect in the next few years?\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing businesses are looking stronger than ever, the next 12 months could present some challenges. Data analytics company Statista gives the U.S. economy a 52% chance of entering a recession by May 2025.\n\nEven if a downturn doesn't occur, cracks are beginning to form in the AI growth narrative as consumer-facing start-ups fail to justify their infrastructure spending with revenue and earnings. According to Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, the industry is debating whether these companies will ever be able to monetize these algorithms, considering the huge amount of capital expenditure needed to train and run them.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35, Amazon stock trades at a modest premium over the NASDAQ 100 estimate of 28. This might be a little high considering the near-term challenges it faces. Over the long term, Amazon is still a winner. However, investors may want to wait for a better price before taking a position in the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The tech sector is filled with companies that have outperformed the S&P 500. In fact, more than a quarter of the S&P 500 consist of tech companies. The preference toward tech stocks is even more apparent in the Nasdaq 100. Part of that distribution is due to the outsized presence of the Magnificent Seven stocks. This is a group of some of the best tech stocks, as almost all of the companies have delivered impressive long-term gains.\n\nMany Magnificent Seven stocks continue to innovate. They’re investing heavily into initiatives like artificial intelligence while strengthening their product lines. However, there are other tech companies that continue to innovate in their industries. Investing in companies that continue to tackle innovative projects can result in long-term returns. However, some corporations are doing a better job than others.\n\nIf you are looking for the best tech stocks that can charge higher due to their promising pipelines, you may want to monitor these three promising opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) 2 Billionaires who Could Push Jeff Bezos Out of Top Spot\n\nSource: alexfan32 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been innovating in multiple industries for decades. The company popularized free 2-day shipping, Prime Day and other trends. Shares continue to perform well, logging an 8% year-to-date gain while increasing by 79% over the past five years. The tech conglomerate is in the middle of a correction that presents a buy the dip opportunity.\n\nThe e-commerce giant reported 10% YOY revenue growth in the second quarter. It was a bit lower than expected, and third quarter guidance didn’t please analysts. Any long-term stock will go through ebbs and flows, especially innovative companies that tend to have high valuations.\n\nAmazon is the leader in the cloud computing industry which is poised to benefit from the AI boom. The tech firm is also investing heavily into artificial intelligence to expand its market share in multiple industries. Amazon Web Services was a bright spot, as that segment grew by 19% YOY.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second largest cloud provider, and cloud computing makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue. The tech giant reported 15% YOY revenue growth and 10% YOY net income growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Those results were largely fueled by Microsoft Cloud’s 21% YOY revenue growth. Cloud revenue made up $36.8 billion of the firm’s $64.7 billion in Q4 FY24 revenue.\n\nAI investments have positioned Microsoft to expand its market share in various industries. The technology also presents Microsoft with several opportunities to innovate. Copilot has been the catalyst for Microsoft’s AI expansion, and investors saw a glimpse of its possibilities with Copilot for Security. This generative AI-powered assistant helps cybersecurity professionals keep data safe, and it simplifies mundane, repetitive tasks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has been a reliable long-term winner in the stock market. Shares are up by 8% year-to-date and have gained 190% over the past five years. The stock is in the middle of a correction which presents a greater margin of safety for investors.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) Person holding smartphone with website of US financial company Social Finance Inc (SoFi) on screen with logo Focus on center of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a digital bank that continues to report significant increases in total members. The fintech firm has attracted members due to its competitive financial products. Since SoFi doesn’t have physical branches, the bank has less overhead and passes the savings onto consumers.\n\nSoFi’s stock gains haven’t been stellar or worth mentioning for several years. It’s an underdog story, to be quick and concise about the 5-year returns. However, some underdogs go big with time, and financials support the bullish thesis. Revenue increased by 20% YOY in the first quarter while net income came in at $17.4 million. SoFi reported a net loss of $47.5 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nRising profit margins with continued revenue growth indicate an opportunity is emerging for the innovative fintech firm. Analysts are mixed and have rated the stock as a “hold.” The average price target implies a 27% gain from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AMZN, MSFT and SOFI.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AdTech stocks.\n\nIt goes without saying that the advertisement technology industry happens to be an exciting and ever-evolving sector, as digital advertising continues to dominate the market trends and remains at the forefront when it comes to strategic marketing. According to industry data by Allied Market Research, the global AdTech market was pegged at $748.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This demonstrates a CAGR of ~14.7% from 2022 to 2031.\n\nThis growth comes off the back of growing digital and internet penetration, increased usage of advanced technology like AI and machine learning, improved prospects for the gaming industry, and growth in social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. Some of the top trends dominating the AdTech industry include higher usage of connected TV (CTV) advertising, in-app advertising, and interactive ads.\n\nGrowth prospects of the AdTech industry\n\nThe AdTech market has been bifurcated into solution, advertising type, size of an enterprise, platform, etc. The AdTech industry includes a wide range of companies and products, such as demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, data management platforms (DMPs), and more. Experts are of the view that the global supply-side platform (SSP) market size should touch ~$117.32 billion by 2033. This means that the industry should compound at ~13.3% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is expected to stem from technological advancements, higher consumer demand, and supportive government policies.\n\nIn the same vein, the demand side platform software market size should touch US$120.1 billion by 2033 on the heels of an improved trend of programmatic advertising and, the need for better targeting along with measurement capabilities for online ads. While the AdTech industry seems promising, inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) makes it even more appealing.\n\nAI's Role in AdTech – Opportunities and Challenges\n\nGlobal AdTech industry continues to prepare for the complete deprecation of third-party cookies by Google, which makes up ~65% of the web browser market share. This transition seems to be a critical step for enabling user privacy and data security. Artificial Intelligence, because of its capability to process vast amounts of data, should play a crucial role.\n\nResearch suggests that ~54% of businesses believe that AI offers advertising cost savings and efficiencies and ~30% of marketing professionals decided to earmark more than 40% of their marketing budget to campaigns that are AI-executed. The advent of smart speakers, voice search, and podcasting can help advertisers in creating fresh avenues to connect with target audiences with the help of audio and voice technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile advertisers can exploit the opportunities available in the AdTech industry, they need to be wary about challenges such as Ad fraud. These frauds are caused mainly because of bot traffic, domain spoofing, or ad stacking. Some other challenges include inventory quality, ad creativity, and brand safety.\n\nAI and ML are revolutionizing digital advertising by enabling advertisers to assess vast amounts of data in real time. As a result, the advertisers can make data-driven decisions for optimizing ad campaigns. Advertisers now use algorithmic advertising, personalization, and performance metrics to maximize ROI.\n\nAI algorithms help in automating media buying, making sure that ads reach the target audience. Personalized ads can be delivered using AI-powered recommendation engines and these engines enable real-time tracking, which can help make quick adjustments to fuel success.\n\nThe global AdTech industry is expected to compound in the mid-teens range over the next decade. Given that it's still early in its growth story, now is the time to look at some of the best AdTech stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected the holdings of SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. For the purposes, we sifted through Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for 1Q 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading online retailer and one of the highest-grossing e-commerce aggregators. The company’s focus areas include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and AI.\n\nThe stock of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) came under pressure after the internet giant missed analysts’ expectations on revenues. The company’s revenues fell short by $760 million. This was mainly because of the subdued growth of North American and international retail segments. This slowness in growth offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\n\nHowever, it seems that the knee-jerk reaction that broader markets saw has impacted the shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has given a healthy outlook, with operating income expected to come in the range of $11.5 billion and $15 billion in 3Q 2024. Even at the mid-point, the company should be able to see an 18% YoY improvement. This compares to the analysts’ expectations of ~6.1% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 for S&P 500 companies.\n\nSecondly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to benefit from the opportunities in cloud computing. The company’s management is of the view that most of its customers have ended their cost management initiatives. These initiatives had earlier led to a slowdown in AWS sales growth. With these initiatives coming to an end, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cutting-edge AI developments should help AWS grow its lead in cloud computing.\n\nThe company’s CEO said that the generative AI boom has been prompting more companies to upgrade their cloud services. AWS tends to have much higher operating margins as compared to the company’s e-commerce marketplaces.\n\nAnalysts at TD Securities increased their price objective on shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from $225.00 to $245.00 on 10th July. A total of 302 hedge funds tracked by the Insider Monkey database held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 293 in the preceding quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best AdTech stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Nowto see the other AdTech stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering strong returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA andJim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Looks Like a Steal Amid the Sell-Off",
        "content": "This week's stock market movement features a lot of fear. Tech stocks sold off heavily, while safe-haven stocks like utilities and pharmaceuticals saw increased interest. The Nasdaq entered correction territory, falling more than 10% off its recent highs. A relatively weak jobs report (114,000 created vs. 185,000 estimates) has some thinking about a recession again and selling stocks. Many investors get understandably jittery during these events. However, market pullbacks are entirely normal.\n\nI look forward to these opportunities. Finally, investors can purchase stocks at reasonable prices rather than at all-time highs.\n\nEven the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are not immune to a correction. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is trading 20% below its recent high, as shown below. AMZN Chart\n\nThe downturn looks like an excellent opportunity for investors to pick up shares at a great price.\n\nHere's why.\n\nWere Amazon's earnings actually \"bad\"?\n\nThe market wasn't pleased with Amazon's second-quarter earnings, but I think some are having trouble seeing the forest for the trees. Net sales increased 10% to $148 billion in Q2, a slowdown from the 13% growth in Q1. This should not be a surprise, given the economy-wide slowing of consumer spending. Amazon's operating income jumped 91%, from $7.7 billion in Q2 last year to $14.7 billion this year. While this looks terrific compared to 2023, it is 4% less sequentially. The slight slowdown in growth from Q1 to Q2 and new recession fears are worrying Wall Street. But Amazon's results were stellar where it matters most: AWS.\n\nAWS is Amazon's cash cow. The cloud segment accounted for $66 billion in operating profits for 2021-2023 combined, a whopping 89% of the company's total operating profit. This is despite a rough 2023 when companies cut data budgets in anticipation of a recession that never came. But artificial intelligence (AI) is now a massive tailwind for cloud service providers. Generative AI programs require incredible data and processing power, and AWS will be a major beneficiary.\n\nAs shown below, AWS revenue growth accelerated in each of the last three quarters. Data source: Amazon.\n\nThis trend is encouraging and bodes well for Amazon's results and stock over the long haul.\n\nIs Amazon stock a buy now?\n\nWhen valuing Amazon, I like to look at its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio and its price-to-cash from operations (CFO). Cash from operations, often called operating cash flow, is important because it tells us how much money a company's primary business generates.\n\nAs depicted below, Amazon is undervalued by 13% based on sales and 75% based on cash flow compared to its 10-year averages.\n\nStory continues AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nThis is the lowest it has traded based on cash flow in over 10 years.\n\nValuing Amazon requires looking past a simple price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, but the current P/E ratio of 38 is also the lowest in more than 10 years.\n\nAmazon's overall sales growth could continue hovering near 10%. Management guided for 8% to 11% growth next quarter. However, AWS is the profit center; it has AI tailwinds and accelerating growth. At times like these, I like to remember two things that Warren Buffett says: \"Be greedy when others are fearful\" and \"the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\" This advice could work well for Amazon investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.14 = US$54b ÷ (US$555b - US$158b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\n\nThus, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 14%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 226% in that time. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Amazon.com's ROCE\n\nTo sum it up, Amazon.com has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nAmazon.com could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for AMZN on our platform quite valuable.\n\nWhile Amazon.com may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds.\n\nWarren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19.8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9.9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills.\n\nBuffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally.\n\nThe significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies.\n\nThe investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks.\n\nHigh-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.  Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market.\n\nDiversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10.7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15.8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29.6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake.\n\nThe billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment.\n\nIn the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $1.80 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about, owing to its leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) made a name for itself in selling goods online, it is increasingly becoming a force to reckon with as it continues to leverage artificial intelligence to strengthen its edge on cloud computing.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the company's cloud unit, is already designing its chips and is increasingly integrating AI into its offerings to strengthen its competitive edge against Microsoft (MSFT). In addition, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already eyeing new growth opportunities through its satellite internet subsidiary, Kuiper.\n\nAs of the end of the first quarter, Warren Buffett and a total of 302 hedge funds held stakes in the tech giant, affirming why it is one of the top stocks.\n\nIn its investor letter from May 2024, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund provided an update on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), sharing their analysis and perspective on the company's performance and future prospects:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds. You can visit Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential and 10 Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Amazon 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Full disclosure: I own shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and am bullish about its prospects. I think the company will continue to reign as the No. 1 e-commerce platform and cloud services provider. It won't surprise me in the least if Amazon's market cap doubles or more by the end of the decade.\n\nThat said, Amazon won't be the biggest stock on the market despite delivering strong gains, in my view. I predict the following three stocks will be worth more than Amazon 10 years from now.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) briefly forfeited its throne earlier this year as the company with the biggest market cap. It could do so again. Nonetheless, I expect it will still be worth more than Amazon in 2034.\n\nAmazon's market cap is roughly $1.5 trillion lower than Apple's right now. The only way it could make up that gap is if Apple performs dismally. I wouldn't bet on that happening.\n\nSure, Apple's iPhone sales growth has evaporated in recent years. That could soon change, though. Apple Intelligence (the company's name for its generative artificial intelligence [GenAI] capabilities) will run only on iPhone 15 Pro and later models. Several Wall Street analysts project that GenAI could spark a huge iPhone upgrade supercycle. I agree with their reasoning.\n\nDon't overlook the potential for 6G to be another massive growth driver for Apple. The next generation of wireless technology could be available early in the next decade. It could be a game-changer in ushering in widespread adoption of augmented reality and perhaps even holographic displays on Apple's iPhones.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't too far behind Apple, with a market cap hovering around $3 trillion. I don't see Amazon vaulting past the tech giant over the next 10 years, even if it delivers stronger growth (which I suspect could happen).\n\nAmazon and Microsoft share at least one key growth driver: organizations' migration of apps and data to the cloud. Although Microsoft Azure is a distant second to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud services market now, I think the gap will narrow over time.\n\nMicrosoft's ace in the hole could be its relationship with OpenAI. It has already integrated GPT-4 throughout its product suite and cloud offerings. If GPT-5 fulfills its potential, it and future large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI and adopted by Microsoft could fuel tremendous growth for both companies.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap of $2 trillion isn't too much greater than Amazon's. I predict the Google parent will still be ahead of Amazon 10 years from now for a few key reasons.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet could gain ground on AWS in the cloud services market. Its Google Cloud is already growing much faster than AWS. Google's AI expertise could enable it to accelerate this growth.\n\nI also think technologies of the future could provide massive tailwinds for Alphabet. The company is already racing to develop AI-powered agents that perform lots of tasks for customers. It's a leader in quantum computing. 6G could present a fantastic opportunity for Google Pixel smartphones and other Android devices. And with Waymo, Alphabet is poised to be one of the biggest winners in what could be a multitrillion-dollar robotaxi market.\n\nHow I could be wrong\n\nWill my prediction come true? I think so. However, there's a chance I could be wrong.\n\nAmazon's growth could be even better than I anticipate. The company could move into new markets more aggressively than before. It could out-innovate rivals, including those mentioned above.\n\nAny or all of the companies I expect to be bigger than Amazon 10 years from now could stumble. Apple's GenAI initiatives might not ignite an iPhone upgrade supercycle. Microsoft might be unable to capitalize on new AI developments from OpenAI for some reason (perhaps OpenAI stumbles or the two companies' relationship sours). Alphabet's Google Search dominance could disappear due to regulatory actions and/or new AI capabilities.\n\nStill, I wouldn't bet against Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet -- or Amazon either. Instead, I own all four stocks and don't plan on selling them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\n\nCEO Says AI is \"Gonna Keep Providing Value\"\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\n\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\n\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\n\nWest Coast's Smartphone Giant: AI Stock or Not?\n\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\n\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today. Our list includes some of the best AI stocks to buy, according to analysts, and some of the companies offering the top AI SEO tools in 2024 as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected AI stocks that made the top AI stocks lists of various financial news reporters, such as Forbes, Motley Fool, Nasdaq, US News, and NerdWallet. We then shortlisted and ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

        "title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Consumer Discretionary Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nMany experts and analysts are concerned about a slowdown in consumer spending. However, reports show that consumer behavior is changing rather than slowing down. According to a report by Colliers Retail Market Intelligence, retail foot traffic rose by 4.4% in June, indicating strong consumer activity despite flat overall sales.\n\nWhile furniture and home improvement stores saw declines due to reduced monumental purchases and a sluggish housing market, grocery stores, and apparel retailers performed better. Grocery sales grew by 1.7%, with a nearly 5% increase in foot traffic, as consumers managed their budgets despite cutting costs. Apparel sales also increased by 3.8%, driven by early back-to-school shopping and wardrobe updates, leading to an 8.3% rise in foot traffic.\n\nIn July, consumer spending saw a modest increase compared to June, with gains across 10 of 12 retail categories, as reported by the CNBC/National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail Monitor. Retail sales, excluding autos and gas, rose by 0.7% month-over-month, slightly up from June's 0.5%, but the year-over-year growth slowed to 0.9%, down from 3.4% in June.\n\nCore retail, which excludes restaurants, saw a 1% monthly increase. Significant sector performances included a 3.4% rise in gas station sales and a 2.1% increase in restaurant spending month-over-month. Conversely, the healthcare, personal care, and garden supplies sectors experienced slight declines.\n\nJune and July data together indicate that consumer spending remains resilient, supported by strong household finances and a strong job market. While some sectors, particularly furniture and home improvement, are struggling due to reduced consumer confidence and a slow housing market, other categories are performing well.\n\nThe data suggests that consumers are still willing to spend, especially on essential and seasonal items, though they may be more cautious with larger purchases. Despite some areas of decline, the overall retail environment appears stable, with consumers continuing to spend where they find value, which indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2024.\n\nLatest Updates on Interest Rates and Potential Effects On Consumer Spending\n\nIn the July meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the Fed's ongoing focus on achieving maximum employment and stable prices. He noted significant progress in the economy, with inflation dropping from 7% to 2.5% and a balanced labor market with low unemployment at 4.1%. The Fed chose to keep interest rates steady within the 5.25% to 5.5% range and continue to reduce its securities holdings to maintain a restrictive stance, which is aimed at aligning demand with supply and reducing inflationary pressures.\n\nStory continues\n\nPowell mentioned that while inflation has eased, the Fed is not yet ready to lower rates and requires more consistent positive data before making such a move, possibly as early as September. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, all the experts are expecting cuts in September. 50.5% of the experts predict a 25 basis points (bps) reduction in the interest rates while 49.5% expect a 50 bps cut.\n\nRate cuts generally have a positive effect on consumer spending. When interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, which could lead to increased consumer borrowing and spending. This increased affordability can boost consumer confidence and promote spending on discretionary items. That's a good set up for discretionary stocks, and with that, let's look at the 10 best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify over 50 large-cap consumer discretionary stocks then narrowed our list to 10 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors as of Q1, and listed the stocks in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a US-based global technology firm that runs through three main segments, North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It tops our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThrough its famous e-commerce platforms, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides an extensive selection of products ranging from electronics and clothing to groceries. In addition to its retail offerings, the company delivers cloud computing solutions through AWS, digital streaming with Prime Video, and a range of consumer electronics, including Kindle e-readers and Echo devices.\n\nIn the first quarter, 302 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), with total positions worth $60.37 billion. As of March 31, Fisher Asset Management is the largest shareholder in the company and has a position worth $7.68 billion.\n\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has established itself as a dominant force in two of the most significant trends of recent years, online retail and cloud computing. Since its early days in 1999, when it generated $650 million in sales, the company has transformed from a small player into a major force in e-commerce.\n\nEven with its immense size, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to see robust revenue growth. In the second quarter, the company reported a 10% increase in consolidated revenue compared to the previous year, driven by growth across all its business segments.\n\nThe key driver of its profitability is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which leads the global cloud infrastructure market with a 32% share, according to Solganick, an independent investment banking and M&A advisory firm. AWS has proven to be a vital component of Amazon's financial success, supporting its overall growth.\n\nAmazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) website attracts over 3 billion visits each month, underscoring its extensive reach and influence in the online marketplace. Additionally, its advertising services have seen impressive year-over-year growth of around 20%, generating nearly $25 billion in revenue.\n\nWith over 310 million active users in its ecosystem, Amazon.com’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment remains a significant contributor to its success. The company continues to push boundaries in e-commerce by innovating with features like electric delivery vans, drones, and the Amazon Prime subscription service. These initiatives not only enhance customer experience but also drive further growth and market leadership.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

        "title": "Should Investors Buy the Dip in Amazon Stock After Shares Slide on Revenue Miss?",
        "content": "August may have just begun, but it has already been a tough month for Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders. The stock initially sank after the e-commerce giant missed analyst revenue estimates when it reported its Q2 results.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock has continued to drift lower, caught in the global market sell-off. A small interest rate hike in Japan and the unwinding of the carry trade appears to be one reason behind the market's recent weakness.\n\nLet's take a closer look at Amazon's most recent results to see if the sell-off is a good opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nSecond-quarter results and guidance fail to impress\n\nWhen it comes to earnings, how a stock reacts is often linked to the expectations going into the results. If a company falls short of analyst estimates for a key metric or issues guidance below analyst expectations, the stock will often feel some near-term pressure.\n\nWhile Amazon posted solid 10% revenue growth in its second quarter, its $148 billion in sales fell short of analyst expectations for revenue of $148.6 billion. Meanwhile, it forecast that its third-quarter sales would grow by 8% to 11% to between $154 billion and $158.5 billion. However, the $156.4 million midpoint of that range was shy of the $158.2 million analyst consensus.\n\nThe company's cloud computing segment, AWS, led the way with revenue growth of 19% to $26.3 billion. AWS' operating income, meanwhile, soared 72% from $5.4 billion to $9.3 billion.\n\nNorth American sales climbed 10% to $90 billion, while international sales rose 7% to $31.7 billion. Advertising services led the way with 20% revenue growth to $12.8 billion. The company is upbeat about the prospects of incorporating advertising into its Prime Video service and it just inked an 11-year deal with the NBA to broadcast live games. Subscription service revenue, meanwhile, grew 11% to $10.9 billion.\n\nThird-party seller services revenue jumped 13% to $36.2 billion. Online stores only saw 6% sales growth to $55.4 billion, while physical stores saw sales grow 4% to $5.2 billion.\n\nLike its cloud computing competitors, Amazon plans to spend heavily to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to support increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) as well as non-AI workloads. As a result, its second-half capital expenditures (capex) will be higher than in the first half.\n\nAmazon also continues to promote its new AI chips, Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference, which will have next-generation versions coming out later this year. According to management, there is a lot of demand for the chips given their price performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs it time to take a dip into Amazon?\n\nAmazon has a number of strong opportunities in front of it. First and foremost is AI, and the company is attacking this opportunity on several levels from cloud computing, to its own AI chips, to offering large language model (LLM) services.\n\nAdvertising is another big opportunity, and this area showed strong growth in the second quarter. Sponsored product ads are currently Amazon's biggest source of ad revenue, but it will begin bringing more advertising to its Prime Video service as well. Meanwhile, its deal with the NBA will undoubtedly bring in a lot of interest and ad dollars to its streaming service.\n\nOne knock against Amazon is its valuation. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 28 based on 2025 analyst estimates. While that is down from historical P/E levels, revenue growth at the company has slowed down over the years. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nGiven its revenue growth and gross margin profile, I would consider Amazon's current valuation a bit on the high side. Amazon's gross margins are much lower than that of a software company. For example, Microsoft has gross margins near 70%, while Amazon's are under 50%, and around 31% when including fulfillment costs.\n\nWith the recent overall market weakness, I'd most likely take a small starter position in Amazon given the opportunities in front of it, while looking to add more if it continues to sell off and its valuation becomes more attractive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Says No to Nvidia GPUs. Is This the End for Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to invest in since the start of 2023. Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.\n\nAlthough Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?\n\nGPUs have been the most popular option for training AI models\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.\n\nBut because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.\n\nOne of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.\n\nThis is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's investment thesis hinges on customers buying more GPUs\n\nPart of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.\n\nThis could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.\n\nThis is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.\n\nStill, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.\n\nTime will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate. But it's a great point to remember if you're considering investing in Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 E-commerce Stocks That Could Benefit from Changing Consumer Habits",
        "content": "E-commerce stocks have had a relatively easy time growing this year despite the recent economic pressures that have put many consumers on the back foot. Part of this is the sheer diversity of products and price points made available by online stores since there’s no physical location to maintain and sell from. Instead, e-commerce companies enjoy broader margins thanks to low-cost business models that follow a pattern of warehousing goods and shipping them directly to customers.\n\nThen there’s the aspect of consumer habits changing in favor of companies that offer a wide selection of good deals. That’s because the U.S. economy is significantly driven by consumption, and Americans are notorious consumers, even when their wallets are hit by inflation and rising housing costs. As such, the companies that tap into these consumptive habits will likely see their stocks grow even in the face of a potential economic slowdown.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nEarlier this year, I warned investors about PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) and its business practices of using import tax loopholes to offer exceptionally cheap products through its e-commerce platform, Temu. Since then, no major developments have led investors to believe the U.S. government will address PDD’s methods.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, PDD’s stock has seen relatively stable performance throughout the year, with the last week helping it recover from a general downtrend. With a month to go until its next earnings report, PDD could be at a decent price point for buying. Moreover, with Temu continuing to remain central to many Americans’ low-cost online shopping experience, there’s a good chance its next earnings report will continue to impress.\n\nOne final development to watch before buying is the current situation between Temu and sellers on the platform protesting its disciplinary fines. On one hand, Temu claims these fines, which for one seller totaled $110,000, result from after-sale complaints. On the other hand, these could lead to a constraint on sellers on the platform, which could impact product diversity on the site, enabling it to keep prices low.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nAmid a company-wide, soul-searching journey, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has seen nearly 33% of its share value evaporate over the past year. As a result, it’s now trading within a dollar of its 52-week low. Yet, with the determination of its leadership to bring the company back to its artisanal roots, there’s hope for the stock in the quarters to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s because Etsy has always been unique among e-commerce stocks. Its original business model focused on small production quantities from self-employed sellers who produced the goods themselves. This initially helped Etsy carve out a niche in the e-commerce sector that intended to offer buyers a more personalized shopping experience while keeping prices fair and relative to seller quality.\n\nNow, its CEO, Josh Silverman, claims the company is back on track to recapture its goal of keeping commerce human with sweeping policy changes that took effect in mid-July. Time will tell if these policy shifts revamp the stock, but at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 25x and a slight revenue bump of 3.01% year-over-year in its second quarter of 2024, Etsy stock could be a solid buying option.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo discussion of e-commerce stocks is complete without mentioning Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The American e-commerce giant has again managed to dominate North America with $90 billion in net sales for the second quarter (Q2) of 2024. This led to an operating income increase of 91% year-over-year, suggesting the company is doing exceptionally well at capturing consumer spending at a time when consumers are more financially constrained than ever.\n\nMoreover, looking specifically at its net product and service sales for Q2, the company sold $61 billion worth of goods and $86 billion worth of services for a total of $147.9 billion for the quarter. More impressive, however, is that Amazon managed to keep its operating expenses around these sales at $133.3 billion, putting net income at  $14.6 billion for the quarter.\n\nThat’s a serious commitment to sales margins that will likely keep investors bullish on the stock as the company grows its e-commerce presence worldwide.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "Comprised of the 503 largest U.S. companies based on market capitalization, the S&P 500 continues to be the yard stick by which most professional investors and traders measure their returns and performance. Year-to-date, the index is up a healthy 11%.\n\nHowever, the S&P 500 index had been doing a lot better this year before it ran into some turbulence in July, which has spilled over into August. A rotation from technology stocks into value and small-cap names, coupled with fears of a U.S. recession, have pulled the S&P 500 down 5% over the last month with nearly half its constituent stocks in the red for the year.\n\nSome stocks are doing particularly bad and dragging down the index’s performance, not to mention investor portfolios. Here are three S&P 500 stocks to sell in August before they crash and burn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nThings have gone from bad to worse at Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) after the entertainment company delivered second-quarter financial results that can best be described as a train wreck. Warner Bros. announced a loss per share of 36 cents, which was greater than a loss of 22 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter totaled $9.70 billion, which missed the $10.07 billion that was forecast among analysts.\n\nWorse, the company reported a $9.1 billion write-down on its TV networks as the market value of the television assets fell below the book value. The company’s traditional TV channels that include TBS, TNT and Discovery continue to erode as customers and advertisers migrate to streaming platforms. Warner Bros. Discovery also continues to struggle with a big debt load caused by the 2022 merger of the Warner Bros. film studio and Discovery television network.\n\nAs of June 30, Warner Bros. Discovery had $41.40 billion of gross debt on its balance sheet versus $3.60 billion of cash. The company also recently lost its right to broadcast future NBA basketball games to streaming rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). WBD stock fell 10% the day its Q2 print was released and is down 50% over the last 12 months.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nOnce mighty retailer Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is struggling to right its ship amid waning demand and a sales slump. Down 52% on the year, Lululemon is the third worst performing stock in the S&P 500 index currently. The share price hit its lowest level in four years at the end of July on news that the company has halted sales of a new product line it had recently launched.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company paused sales of its “Breezethrough” yoga wear line so that it can adjust and deliver the best possible product to consumers. The move prompted a slew of downgrades on LULU stock across Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) pulled Lululemon from its list of “top stock picks.” The halt of the Breezethrough line of clothing is the latest setback for Lululemon.\n\nManagement had said that revenue was likely to accelerate in the year’s second half helped by new product launches. That forecast now seems in doubt, making Lululemon an S&P 500 stock to sell.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nChipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has the distinction of being the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 index this year. So far in 2024, INTC stock has declined 58%. The company’s share price plummeted 22% after it announced that it is suspending its quarterly dividend payment alongside extremely weak Q2 financial results. The company had previously paid shareholders a dividend of 12 cents per share each quarter, giving the stock a yield of 1.72%.\n\nNews of the dividend suspension was accompanied by Q2 results that missed Wall Street targets. The Silicon Valley-based maker of microchips and processors reported EPS of 2 cents, which was well below the 10 cents expected among analysts. Revenue of $12.83 billion missed a consensus target of $12.94 billion. Sales were down 1% from a year ago. Management also announced that they are eliminating 15% of Intel’s global workforce, equal to about 17,500 positions, as they try to reduce costs by $10 billion.\n\nThere wasn’t a single piece of good news in Intel’s latest financial results. INTC stock is now trading 57% below where it was at five years ago.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy and Never Sell: 2024 Edition",
        "content": "The stock market has shown high volatility despite the rising fears of a recession, mixed earnings season and the anticipation surrounding rate cuts. Apart from the past week, it was an excellent year for the stock market, with several blue-chip stocks hitting their 52-week high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were driven to new highs due to the tech industry. However, the current dip is a great chance for investors to consider blue-chip stocks to buy and hold.\n\nThese are the stocks that stand the test of time. While there are several blue-chip stocks to pick from, a few shine through, and these stocks should never be sold. You will see volatility with them, too, but they will continue to rise from any lows. These blue-chip stocks are gems that will help your money grow. With that in mind, let’s take a look at them.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a stock to buy and hold forever. One of the best companies in the world, Microsoft, has seen incredible growth over the years. Its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and the company generates a significant part of its revenue from the cloud segment. Inflation or recession, Microsoft is one stock that will never disappoint.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp 8% year-to-date, MSFT is exchanging hands for $402 and has a modest dividend yield of 0.74%. Microsoft has a wide range of products and services that have become integral to our lives. With companies switching towards the cloud, the demand for its cloud services will soar.\n\nMicrosoft Azure was disappointing in the recent quarter, but management believes that growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. In the recent quarter, revenue jumped 15% year-over-year while net income was up 10%. However, the company’s big picture looks attractive. Do not make the mistake of judging its potential based on one quarterly result. It is a long-term player with ample growth potential.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) rarely disappoints. While the world aims to move toward renewable energy, it will take many more years to become a reality. Until then, the demand for oil and gas will continue to grow. With oil prices hitting new highs, Exxon Mobil is set to benefit.\n\nUp 15% YTD, the stock is trading for $117 and is one of the best oil and gas stocks to own. It had the best second quarter among all the oil companies. The company reported an EPS of $2.14 and a revenue of $93.06 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt easily beat estimates. Exxon Mobil saw strong revenue due to record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana. It also saw record output after the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, which gave it access to additional assets.\n\nAs a dividend stock, management spent $4.30 billion in dividends in the second quarter. It enjoys a yield of 3.22% and has increased dividends for 42 consecutive years. The world runs on oil, and Exxon Mobil will benefit from it.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), is today’s household name. Driven by Google Search and YouTube, Alphabet reports strong fundamentals and holds a dominating share of the market.\n\nThe business sees steady growth in the cloud segment, search revenue and YouTube ad revenue. In the recent quarter, Alphabet saw revenue of $84.74 billion, with ad revenue standing at $64.62 billion, a major growth contributor. For the first time this quarter, its cloud segment reported $10 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating profit.\n\nMany were concerned about Alphabet’s search engine market share after the launch of ChatGPT; however, Alphabet showed its strength and proved that it was not easy to grab its market share. It is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy and hold.\n\nAlready holding a strong position today, GOOG stock is trading for $163 and is up 17% YTD. The stock has been a buy-and-hold for decades because the demand for Google’s products and services will not slow down, and the company is known for innovation. It will always have something that will grab the market share. It is an unstoppable stock to buy.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Can of Coca-Cola, a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nBeverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is up 14% YTD and is trading for $68. It is a solid business, and buying the stock below $100 is an ideal opportunity. The company has nailed a business model that allows it to keep operating costs low while ensuring steady revenue. Its global presence, an umbrella of products, and a strong brand name work wonders for the business.\n\nCoca-Cola is also a dividend aristocrat with a yield of 2.82%. It is a business that will never disappoint you. Its products are sold in more than 200 countries, and its diverse product offering helps meet consumers’ changing preferences. This ensures steady cash flow, and the company believes in sharing the gains with shareholders.\n\nFor the second quarter, the company beat expectations and raised full-year guidance. It reported a revenue of $12.36 billion and an EPS of 84 cents. The company saw a 3% rise in net sales and a 15% jump in organic revenue. For the full year, it aims for 9% to 10% organic revenue growth.\n\nCoca-Cola is an ideal mix of passive income and capital growth. It is a stock that will steadily keep rewarding you for your patience.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nThe largest retailer in the world, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continues to expand its e-commerce business. Its simple business model has worked wonders for the company. With several fulfillment centers across the United States, Walmart has become the first choice for those looking for low-priced goods.\n\nUp 27% YTD, the stock is trading for $67 and is on an impressive rally. With the rising popularity of e-commerce, Walmart has also invested in the segment and saw a 24% rise in revenue for the second quarter. It broke all records with the grocery segment, capturing 37% of the market.\n\nThe company is also generating revenue from the advertising business, which saw a 35% jump. This clearly shows that Walmart is growing its online presence and is here to stay. Based on the strong financials, management has raised the full-year outlook.\n\nAnother reason to buy the stock is the dividend yield of 1.23%. The company has increased dividends for 49 consecutive years. Buying WMT stock below $100 is a smart choice.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa‘s (NYSE:V) business model is one big reason to invest in it. While the stock hasn’t had a good year, it remains one of the best fintech stocks to own. It holds a strong market position with more than 4 billion cards in circulation. The company’s global presence and successful business model make it a long-term buy and hold.\n\nTrading at $259, the stock has remained flat for most of the year. The company is the largest payment processor globally and makes money whenever a card is used to purchase.\n\nIn the recent quarterly results, Visa saw a 10% rise in net revenue to $8.9 billion and a 7% rise in payment volume. Visa will only gain as we transition from cash to a digital economy. Despite competition, Visa has remained a leader in the industry, and no company has been able to take its market share. Holding Visa stock long-term will ensure steady passive income and capital growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the top e-commerce company, having transformed the way people shop. It has built a heavily diversified business and enjoys a strong presence across multiple industries. In addition to the e-commerce business, the company generates significant revenue from the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the advertising business.\n\nIn the second quarter, Amazon reported revenue of $148.0 billion, up 10% year over year. The cloud segment revenue hit $26.3 billion, up 19% year over year. The net income doubled to $13.5 billion from $6.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nWith a growing market share of AWS, Amazon is in a strong position to make the most of the demand for cloud computing. A leader in the space, this stock will not disappoint you for years. Trading for $164, the stock is up 9% YTD and 17% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe stock has dipped after the mixed results due to low consumer spending, but the long-term picture for the company looks attractive. Amazon has built a solid infrastructure that ensures quick delivery of all goods, and it will continue to dominate the e-commerce industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Sell Before the 2024 Tech Selloff Worsens",
        "content": "The recent carry trade scare sent Japanese stocks into a tailspin, and the contagion spread to other markets faster than a juicy rumor in a high school cafeteria. Even stocks that were already in correction mode got hammered even harder. Some analysts warn that the carry trade debacle could just be the tip of the iceberg for stocks to sell.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough to give investors heartburn, the macro picture also looks pretty grim. All the usual recession red flags are waving – the inverted yield curve, rising unemployment, and now the ominous-sounding Sahm indicator. You don’t have to be an economist to read the writing on the wall.\n\nIn times like these, taking a hard look at your portfolio and considering trimming some of your riskier positions is prudent. High-risk, high-reward stocks can be exciting when the market is soaring, but they can also be a one-way ticket to Painsville when things go south. I’m not saying abandon them entirely, but it’s a good idea to dial back your exposure a bit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech stocks, in particular, could be in for a world of hurt. They’ve had an incredible run over the past two years. However, if the market really takes a nosedive, tech could bear the brunt of it, just as they have contributed to most of its rally.\n\nAs such, I believe now is a good time to consider selling these seven tech stocks before the potential 2024 tech selloff worsens.\n\nFair Isaac Corporation (FICO) An image of a laptop, tablet, and phone with various software and tech imagery on their screens\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFair Isaac Corporation (NYSE:FICO) develops analytic, software, and data management products that enable businesses to automate and improve decisions. The company recently reported mixed Q3 2024 results, with revenue growing 12% year-over-year to $448 million but EPS missing expectations by 7 cents.\n\nWhile FICO is thriving in the booming data analytics industry, I believe now is the time to take profits and sell the stock before the tech selloff worsens. Shares have skyrocketed 95% over the past year and an eye-popping 357% in the last five years, trading at nosebleed valuations of nearly 24x forward sales and 70x forward earnings. Its cyclically adjusted price-sales ratio is at its highest ever. Stocks to sell: FICO cyclically adjusted PS ratio\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nYou’d think those multiples would be justified by explosive growth, but analysts only expect around 13% annual revenue growth and 20% EPS growth going forward. That’s simply not enough to warrant such a premium price tag, in my view.\n\nWith recession fears mounting and interest rates still elevated, I worry that Wall Street will sour on pricey tech stocks like FICO in the coming months. It might be better to lock in your gains now before market sentiment potentially shifts to risk-off mode. The risk/reward is just not favorable at these levels, putting it among stocks to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) CHPT a chargepoint charging station\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) provides electric vehicle charging solutions, but the company has been struggling mightily lately. Even before the recent tech selloffs, ChargePoint was facing major headwinds, reporting an 18% year-over-year revenue decline to $107 million and widening losses in its latest quarter.\n\nI believe the ongoing tech rout could greatly exacerbate ChargePoint’s dire situation. The entire EV sector has been sliding over the past two years as high interest rates weigh on demand. Bigger players like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are already eating ChargePoint’s lunch, and the company is being forced to dilute its stock to keep the lights on.\n\nEven if rates are drastically cut, I think ChargePoint’s losses are simply too steep to overcome anytime soon. A recovery in the EV market will likely be prolonged, and a potential Trump administration could make matters even worse for the industry. CHPT revenue, cash, EBIT chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnd if the cash balance doesn’t go to zero until analysts think it hits profitability, the sales growth would be too sluggish to maintain the current premium.\n\nIn my view, you should steer clear of this sinking ship.\n\nViasat (VSAT) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems like Elon Musk is eating everyone’s lunch these days, and Viasat (NASDAQ:VSAT) is no exception. Despite Viasat’s best efforts, I believe the writing is on the wall – unless they can pivot to a completely new business model, bankruptcy may be inevitable. After all, why would anyone choose Viasat’s sluggish, high-latency service when Starlink offers a superior alternative?\n\nViasat’s most recent earnings report paints a bleak picture, with revenue growth expected to remain in the low single digits for the foreseeable future. However, I suspect even those modest projections are overly optimistic. As Starlink continues to scale and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) prepares to enter the fray, Viasat’s market share will likely erode faster than anticipated, potentially pushing sales growth into negative territory.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dilutive track record is pretty concerning. Viasat dilution\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith the tech sector already in the midst of a major selloff, Viasat’s precarious position looks even more dire. Unless management can pull off a miracle, I fear this once-promising company may not survive the coming storm for stocks to sell.\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) operates as a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin (BTC-USD). The company has been struggling lately, with its recent Q2 2024 earnings missing expectations and showing a significant net loss of $200 million, largely due to lower Bitcoin production and the decreased value of its digital assets.\n\nBitcoin mining businesses have been a major letdown in the current cycle. Sure, Bitcoin’s price more than doubled from its low point in the last crypto winter, but the rally happened well before the halving event that slashed mining rewards in half. Miners had years to prepare for this, yet they’re still posting massive losses and can’t seem to mine Bitcoin profitably.\n\nNow, some folks think Bitcoin’s price could keep climbing, but I’m not convinced. We haven’t seen how Bitcoin will fare during a serious recession, and its performance is increasingly tied to the broader market. With a major tech downturn looming, I think Bitcoin could be in for a rough ride – and that spells trouble for Marathon Digital. The crushing dilution also makes a long-term position in MARA untenable.

The company reported an 11% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2024, and analysts don’t expect it to achieve consistent profitability until at least 2028. I’m skeptical that Sunrun has the cash reserves to sustain itself that long. The debt-powered growth has now turned into Sunrun’s main cause for concern after interest rate hikes. Sunrun cash debt chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nLooking ahead, Sunrun’s projected sales growth also appears lackluster. As I mentioned earlier in this article, a potential Trump presidency could further dampen the outlook for stocks like Sunrun. Jefferies analyst Dushyant Ailani lowered his price target on RUN from $32 to $26, citing concerns about the company’s path to profitability.\n\nGiven these risks and uncertainties, I believe it’s prudent to consider removing Sunrun from your portfolio.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) designs, manufactures, tests, and sells analog and embedded semiconductors. The company has been navigating a challenging environment, with revenue declining 16% year-over-year in Q2 2024 to $3.82 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of sales and profit declines. While TI beat earnings estimates by $0.02 and matched on revenue, the cyclical slump in demand is expected to persist for at least another quarter.\n\nI’ve long considered TI one of the best semiconductor stocks, and I believe its long-term prospects remain bright, given its strong position in the crucial industrial and automotive markets. However, the recent Q2 report gives me pause in the near term. Missing earnings estimates by even a small amount seem out of character when most peers have been handily exceeding expectations. The recent increase in inventory is also concerning. TXN inventory chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith TI trading at a lofty 11 times forward sales and analysts projecting low double-digit growth after this year’s sales decline, I worry the stock has gotten ahead of itself. If TI can’t execute on those modest estimates, shares could be vulnerable to a pullback.\n\nZeta Global Holdings (ZETA) Cloud graphic with wires coming out of it symbolizing cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nZeta Global Holdings (NYSE:ZETA) operates an AI-powered marketing cloud platform. The company has been on an absolute tear lately, with its stock price soaring 168% year-to-date on the back of stellar earnings results.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Zeta’s revenue jumped 33% year-over-year to $227.8 million, beating estimates by over $15 million. The company is nearing profitability as it emerges from its startup phase, with adjusted EBITDA surging 44% to $38.5 million. However, it is still loss-making if you look at it from a GAAP perspective. The Sloan Ratio still points to the quality of its earnings as “low.” Moreover, GuruFocus’ DCF model shows the stock as “Significantly Overvalued.” Zeta GF DCF valuation\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMost stocks on this “stocks to sell” list are struggling with deteriorating fundamentals, but that’s certainly not the case with Zeta. Analysts have been rushing to raise their price targets, with the average now sitting at $21. Zeta was even named a Leader in Forrester’s 2024 Email Marketing Service Providers report.\n\nHowever, I think it’s time to start taking some chips off the table. If the widely anticipated recession hits, marketing and ad budgets could be the first to get slashed, putting Zeta’s growth story at risk. The stock’s huge run-up leaves plenty of room for a pullback.\n\nOf course, I wouldn’t dare short a stock with this much momentum. But if you’re sitting on big gains, now is a good opportunity to do some trimming before we enter a trickier phase of the market cycle.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Cooperating with Pinterest and TikTok, which has 170 million monthly active users in the US, will enable Amazon to drive its revenue through \"social shopping\", the company said.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, competition with Shein and Temu continues to heat up.\n\nTemu's gross merchandise value (GMV) surged to about US$20 billion in the first half of 2024, surpassing overall sales of US$18 billion in 2023, according to a report by Chinese media outlet 36Kr. Temu expects to hit the US$30 billion GMV milestone in 2024, according to a report last December by Chinese media LatePost.\n\nShein, meanwhile, has forecast its 2025 GMV to reach US$58.5 billion, up from US$22.7 billion in 2022, The Financial Times reported in February.\n\nTemu topped the shopping app download charts across 125 markets in 2023 including the US, where Shein ranked second, according to a report by Data.ai.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Walmart WMT shares held their own in the market’s recent turmoil, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning. With the company on deck to report quarterly results on Thursday, August 15th, Walmart’s results will provide us with an important window into the health of the consumer economy. Worries about the economy and recession risks were a big driver of the market sell-off.\n\nThis week also brings quarterly results from Home Depot HD on Tuesday, August 13th. But Home Depot is primarily a housing play, which has been struggling lately due to higher mortgage rates.\n\nIn addition to Walmart and Home Depot, we will also get the July inflation and Retail Sales readings, with the CPI report coming on Wednesday, August 14th, and the Retail Sales report the same morning as Walmart’s release (Thursday).\n\nThe inflation report has been the market’s primary preoccupation in recent months, given its significance to the coming Fed easing that is widely expected to get underway in September. In the wake of the recent market turmoil, many expect that the central bank will opt for a bigger magnitude of cut at the September meeting than would have been the case otherwise.\n\nThe inflation trend has been favorable over the last couple of months after coming out on the hot side in the first few months of the year. The Retail Sales reading will most likely get much more scrutiny this time, given the market’s focus on the economy’s growth momentum, which has notably eased in recent months.\n\nGetting back to Walmart’s quarterly release, please see below how Walmart shares performed relative to the Home Depot, the S&P 500 index, and the Magnificent 7 stocks. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart’s defensive attributes reflect the retailer’s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart’s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nWalmart’s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under growing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart’s same-store sales in its quarterly release.\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.65 in EPS on $168.4 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.6% and +4.2%, respectively. Trends in Walmart’s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, though management had pointed to some early signs of stabilization in a few discretionary product categories at the last earnings call. Any favorable turn in the demand trends for the retailer’s discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target TGT.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below uses a longer time span than the four-week period we used earlier, with the one-year performance of Walmart relative to Home Depot, Mag 7, and the S&P 500 index. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWalmart shares were up big following the last quarterly release on May 15th, which was the second quarter in a row of market participants cheering the retailer’s quarterly results. One relatively less noted part of Walmart’s growing digital footprint is the retailer’s growing advertising business. It is still a relatively small part of Walmart’s total revenues, but this revenue stream is growing fast and enjoys a much higher margin.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players. The 23 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +26.2% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 52.2% beating EPS estimates and only 34.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top- line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart’s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID lockdowns.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q2 earnings calls, as we did from Amazon, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 2nd, we have seen Q2 results from 456 S&P 500 members, or 91.2% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +9.1% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating EPS estimates and only 59% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have seen results from more than 90% of S&P 500 members already. This week brings in results from more than 400 companies, including 8 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include the aforementioned Walmart and Home Depot, Brinker International, Cisco Systems, Tapestry, Deere & Company, China’s Alibaba, Applied Materials, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). Revenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.3% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July.\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter got underway. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are going up, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.2% on +1.7% revenue growth.

        "title": "Nvidia stock registers weekly loss as Wall Street sees 'urgent demand' keeping the chip trade intact",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) closed on Friday with a weekly loss of 2% as investors continue to sort through what's been a challenging last several weeks for the year's hottest trade.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts this week remained confident in the long-term prospects for Nvidia, which is now down about 20% over the last month and off more than 25% from its record closing high.\n\nEarlier this week, Piper Sandler analysts called out a \"tremendous opportunity\" to buy Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and ON Semiconductor (ON) following the sector's recent sell-off.\n\nSome analysts also took the opportunity to upgrade the stock during this sell-off.\n\n\"I think that for 2025 ... things are fairly well set,\" New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. \"We know roughly how much [hyperscalers] expect to grow capex. Plans are already set.\" New Street upgraded Nvidia to a Buy this week with a $120 price target.\n\nOn Friday, chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM), a supplier to Nvidia, posted a 45% year-over-year increase in sales in July — a sign that AI demand remains strong.\n\n\"We still sense an urgent demand across the board, and that mitigates the risk in a pause in shipments as customers wait for the next generation of chips to be available in volumes,\" said Chkaiban.\n\nThe so-called hyperscalers — Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — each remained consistent during recent earnings reports in their commitment to AI investment. And much of this investment flows right to Nvidia.\n\n“Investors will likely revisit the AI-levered names because that within [semiconductors] is still the one area spending is flowing in terms of customer spending as evidenced by increases in capex by multiple hyperscalers this earnings period,” Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nTalk of a possible delay for Nvidia’s Blackwell next-generation chip put added pressure on the stock earlier this week. A two-month wait for the chips wouldn’t be inconsequential, analysts say, but it would still not be enough to move the needle on Wall Street expectations.\n\nCurtis's team stated in a recent note the Nvidia delays \"are real, but not a thesis changer.\" The company is set to report quarterly results at the end of August.\n\nAnalysts and strategists looking at markets more broadly also see the recent cooling in the AI trade as an opportunity.\n\nTruist Advisory's chief marketing strategist Keith Lerner upgraded the tech sector to Overweight on Thursday after a 12% decline from its mid-July peak with semiconductors down almost 20%. Lerner noted that despite the drop in the price of these stocks, tech’s forward earnings estimates continue to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This suggests the recent setback was due more to crowded positioning as opposed to a shift in fundamentals,\" Lerner wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\"Moreover, in a cooling economic environment, we expect investors to come back to tech given some of the secular tailwinds stemming from artificial intelligence (AI) and its premium growth prospects. Moreover, during the current earnings season, we have seen capital spending trends toward AI continue to rise.\"\n\nBut recent sentiment shifts don't necessarily resolve the looming question, which investors will in time want answered — how do these massive AI investments eventually pay off?\n\n\"When it comes to technology, what's very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture but also the fact that people want to see ... evidence that that GenAI trade is actually driving positive outcomes,\" Luke Barrs, managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"We have to just be cautious and let it play out over the next year or two.\"\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Strategist: Why Meta looks like the 'Magnificent 7' standout right now",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks haven't had it easy lately, but investors shouldn't toss in the towel on them during a volatile August for markets.\n\nBe precise with the picks right now given more challenging market conditions, said Wind Shift Capital founder Bill Blain.\n\nBlain — the longtime author of the Morning Porridge newsletter — tagged Meta (META) as the best Magnificent Seven play today.\n\n“The business of advertising is massive,” Blain told Yahoo Finance executive Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). “About 75% of advertising goes through the internet, and the firm that controls that best at the moment is [Meta].”\n\nMeta's second quarter earnings last week underscore Blain's bullish call.\n\nEarnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 73% from a year ago.\n\nIts app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) also walloped expectations with revenues of $38.72 billion. Sales for the app family rose about $7 billion year over year.\n\nMeta stock has rallied 7.5% since the company's Aug. 1 earnings report, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares are still off by 4% in the past month as sentiment has soured on the Magnificent Seven name.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven includes Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta.\n\nUnlike Meta, the other six names have dealt with various negative news in recent weeks that have pressured their shares.\n\nNvidia is reportedly delaying the shipment of its new Blackwell AI chips by a quarter. Tesla had a terrible second quarter. Alphabet preached of needing more time for AI adoption, while market leader Microsoft's AI results didn't live up to expectations. Amazon warned of a slowing consumer in its second quarter.\n\nAll of the non-Meta Magnificent Seven stocks are down since Meta's earnings report, led by a 13% drop in Tesla stock.\n\nThen there is Apple.\n\nBlain, who had been bullish on Apple, has recently shifted perspective.\n\n“When Warren Buffett turned around and dumped the stock, I thought, he must know something I don’t,” said Blain.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) reportedly slashed its stake in the tech giant by as much as 50%. It's unclear as to Buffett's motivation, but it sent a negative signal to an increasingly jittery market.

        "title": "Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum",
        "content": "While some tech companies are suffering a sell-off, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has fallen by 11% in the last 30 days, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has fallen by an even greater 16%, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has continued to advance and reached the $224 mark in the post-earnings period.\n\nThis new valuation level for Apple is justified by its responsibility for spreading artificial intelligence (or Apple Intelligence) technology through its strong user base and possible monetization from this, such as a better cycle for its hardware and maintaining the momentum of service revenue.\n\nApple maintaining this very premium valuation level is explained by its excellent earnings, which have highlighted a clearer scenario for the company.\n\nEarnings were pretty solid\n\nIn its third fiscal quarter, Apple delivered very strong indicators reinforcing its good prospects for the end of this fiscal year and the medium term. Net revenue was up 5%, driven by services and the resumption of growth in iPads and Macs. While the market expected revenue of around $84.40 billion, the reported figure was $85.50 billion. The tech giant also beat earnings per share projections, delivering $1.40 while estimates were $1.34.\n\nOverall, each key performance indicator surprised the market in a positive way. The company also recorded 24% year-over-year growth in iPad sales, 2% growth for Macs and the maintenance of very strong momentum for its services revenue. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nEven iPhone sales, which shrank by 1% but showed slight growth on a constant currency basis, show the continued strength and resilience of smartphones and confirm what was mentioned in the call that the iPhone 15 models continue to be chosen by consumers, with the Pro and Pro Max being able to use Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile only the newest iPhones will be able to make full use of Apple Intelligence features, Macs with Apple Silicon since 2020 will have these features.\n\nOnce again, the positive highlight was the services segment, which reached $24.20 billion and paid subscriptions reaching an all-time high. In addition, the advertising, cloud and payments subsegments achieved all-time highs due to significant operational advances in Apple TV, Apple Pay, Maps and other features.\n\nOn the negative side were results in China, which fell by 6.50% and just under 3% in constant currency. Even if the risk of a slowdown in sales and the exchange rate risk persists, it may not be as severe as the installed base in the region has reached a new record, which may be a sign that the environment remains competitive, but with a greater level of stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, management's expectation is that in the fourth quarter, revenue will grow at the same rate as in the third, which was close to 5%. In addition, they believe the gross margin will be between 45.50% and 46.50%, which is also close to what was recorded last quarter. This guidance was higher than expected by Wall Street.\n\nThe valuation is still reasonable\n\nIf we look only at momentum and the market's reaction to recent earnings, sentiment for Apple is bullish. Operationally, the company has returned to growth, continues to deliver good profitability indicators and its outlook for the AI narrative is excellent, with the main view being the company will offer (and possibly further popularize) these functionalities with its broad user base.\n\nAnd this is mainly revealed by the company's valuation. Apple's forward price-earnings ratio is 30, above its average of 26 over the last five years and very close to Microsoft, which trades at 31 times its net income. One of the things worth reflecting on is whether Apple really deserves the same award as Microsoft since its operations, although resilient and driven by services, still have a greater cyclicality, less recurrence and more timid growth prospects when compared to other big tech players.\n\nThis makes Apple's GF Value rank a low 3 out of 10, mainly due to multiples that exceed its own history and are in line with or slightly above the industry. Therefore, on the GF Value chart, Apple appears to be modestly overvalued, which makes a lot of sense in the current context. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nIn a discounted cash flow model using net income as a proxy, it can be seen that Apple shares really are not a bargain currently, but they are not extremely overvalued either. With very reasonable assumptions, such as average growth of 5% (Wall Street estimates), a net income margin of 27% (made possible by continued efficiency gains and a better mix between services and products) and terminal growth of 4% with a discount rate of 8%, we find a fair price of $193 for Apple, a downside of just over 10% that seems within the margin of error. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nSource: Alpha Spread\n\nDespite the very small margin of safety, the bright side is that as Apple is an excellent company. We are much more likely to see positive surprises than negative ones.\n\nIn other words, if Apple comes up with some new factor that boosts earnings (or the narrative that earnings are going up), this could continue to boost the stock.\n\nApple isn't that attractive anymore\n\nThe downside is that, in relative terms, Apple has lost some of its appeal due to the eroding margin of safety. When we think about increasing exposure to a particular stock, we must always consider the opportunity cost and other allocation possibilities.\n\nAs mentioned, while Apple shares rose post-earnings, Microsoft and Amazon experienced dips. This makes Amazon and Microsoft a much more rational buy at the moment based on the history of the last five years. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\n\nApple does not lose value because of this, but it makes it less attractive in relative terms since Amazon and Microsoft also have great prospects, large moats and will have a large share and benefit from the AI trend. For fiscal 2024, the consensus expects earnings per share growth of 9.33% year over year for Apple, Microsoft growth of 11.70% (for 2025) and Amazon growth of just over 60%. In other words, while they are all good prospects, Microsoft and Amazon stand out with promises of faster growth.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI believe the third quarter was a tipping point for Apple. The company appears to have returned to growth (albeit below other big techs) and managed to catch up with its peers in the AI race, which makes the outlook for the medium and long term much better.\n\nThe downside is this comes with an expansion in multiples that greatly reduces the margin of safety. Even though the stock is not very overvalued, it makes it less attractive when compared to similar options from consolidated technology-related companies with large moats and exposure to the most important trends in the market such as the cloud and AI.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Got $5,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "This month, a sell-off has wiped billions from the stock market, with the Nasdaq Composite down nearly 10% in the last 30 days. Fears of a recession have deeply concerned investors after news broke that the U.S. added 114,000 jobs in July against expectations of 175,000.\n\nHowever, tech's long growth history and reputation for offering stockholders consistent and significant gains over many years make it a compelling place to invest. Despite a sell-off, the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite has risen 280% since 2014. So, recent declines actually present an exciting investment opportunity and the chance to pick up some stocks for a better value.\n\nMarkets such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, semiconductors, and more still have plenty of room to grow over the long term and could fuel the industry for decades.\n\nSo, got $5,000 spare? Here are two tech stocks to buy and hold for the long term. However, even a smaller investment could go far with these companies.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price is down 16% over the last month. The recent sell-off hasn't been kind to the world's third most valuable tech company and the unofficial poster child for AI. However, at 21% below its all-time high in June, Nvidia's shares remain a compelling option for long-term-minded investors.\n\nDespite recent declines, Nvidia hasn't given any indication that its earnings won't continue soaring, thanks to its lead in the chip market. The company is responsible for at least 80% of the AI chip market, 91% of data center graphics processing units (GPUs), and 88% of desktop GPUs (chips sold directly to consumers).\n\nAccording to a study from TechInsights, Nvidia shipped 3.76 million data center GPUs in 2023. For reference, a total of 3.85 million data center GPUs were shipped during the year when including sales from AMD and Intel.\n\nNvidia's success has seen its earnings skyrocket, extending its lead over rivals. Since last August, the chipmaker's quarterly revenue and operating income have increased by 44% and 62%, with free cash flow rising 112% to $15 billion. Meanwhile, AMD's free cash flow reached $439 million this year, and Intel's is at negative $3 billion. Nvidia's market dominance and significant cash reserves will likely prove a formidable combination over the long term as chip demand continues to rise and the company reinvests in its business.\n\nNvidia is trading at 60 times its earnings, which doesn't exactly shout \"Bargain!\" However, that figure is significantly lower than its five-year average of 80, signaling an excellent time to buy its stock and hold it indefinitely.\n\nStory continues\n\nHalf of your $5,000 would buy about 25 shares in Nvidia at its current price.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has seen its stock slip 17% since early July amid a market downturn. However, consistently expanding cloud and advertising divisions illustrate a shift in its business model that could pay off over the long term.\n\nThe company posted its second quarter of 2024 earnings on Aug. 1, revealing a bit of a mixed bag. Revenue rose 10% year over year but missed expectations by $760 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $1.26 beat consensus estimates by $0.23, proving the effectiveness of recent cost-cutting measures. The company suffered from softer-than-expected sales for the quarter, with revenue from its online store rising 5% year over year.\n\nHowever, solid growth from its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its advertising services strengthened its long-term outlook. In Q2, AWS sales jumped 19%, while operating income soared 74%. Meanwhile, revenue from ads on platforms like Prime Video increased 20% year over year as the segment continued on its positive growth trajectory.\n\nRetail remains a lucrative venture. However, it can also be a weak point for Amazon as the business relies heavily on the state of the economy and consumers' spending power. As a result, solid growth in more stable sectors like cloud computing and digital ads is promising for Amazon's future.\n\nAmazon's quarterly operating income and free cash flow have soared 31% and 186% over the last year, mainly thanks to the profitability of AWS. Alongside a price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio that are well below Amazon's 10-year average for both metrics, the company's stock is a no-brainer right now and worth at least half of your $5,000 investment. That $2,500 would yield about 15 shares of Amazon at its current position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Dump After Disappointing Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "The trade in technology stocks is getting more difficult. The mega-cap tech names known collectively as the “Magnificent Seven” lost a combined $1 trillion of value amid the global market rout that occurred on August 5. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost $168 billion in market capitalization as its stock fell 6.4%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended down 4.8% and 4.1% respectively on the day. As you can see, market volatility is impacting even the biggest names, helping identify the top tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nHowever, the declines are more broad-based, with many technology stocks suffering losses since the beginning of July when investors began rotating money out of tech names and into value and small-cap securities. That rotation has only worsened amid rising fears that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession and as many well-known technology companies report poor second-quarter financial results.\n\nIt’s a big reversal from this year’s first half when technology stocks led the market rally as investors bet on the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot even a 10-for-1 stock split could paper over Super Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) horrible second-quarter financial results. SMCI stock is down 18% in the last five days, as the company reported EPS of $6.25, missing Wall Street’s target of $8.07. Revenue totaled $5.31 billion, which was only marginally better than the $5.30 billion that was forecast.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Super Micro Computer said that its gross margin dropped to 11.2% in Q2 from 17% a year earlier. A lower margin means the company is earning less profit on each product it sells. The company’s forward guidance was nothing to write home about either. A Q3 earnings outlook of a $7.48 midpoint fell below consensus estimates of $7.58.\n\nAs for the stock split, it’s due to occur on October 1. But with the stock down 60% from its 52-week high and trading under $500 a share, is a split even needed? SMCI stock has fallen 45% since the start of July, making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost as bad as the Q2 print delivered by Super Micro Computer was the one from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Shares of the company plunged 15% after management reported Q2 earnings that missed Wall Street’s target. Airbnb reported EPS of 86 cents, which was below the consensus forecast among analysts of 92 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue of $2.75 billion slightly beat estimates of $2.74 billion, and sales were up 11% from a year earlier. However, the outlook provided on the earnings call sunk the stock. Specifically, management warned that it anticipates some moderation in its year-over-year bookings during the current third quarter. They cautioned that they are seeing “…some signs of slowing demand from U.S. guests.”\n\nInvestors are carefully watching for signs that consumers are pulling back on spending amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing and might be headed for a recession. ABNB stock is down 22% in the last 12 months.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform.

But that was then, this is now. For the second quarter, Coinbase announced decidedly mixed financial results amid a slump in cryptocurrency prices and trading demand. Specifically, Coinbase posted EPS of 14 cents, which badly missed Wall Street consensus targets of 94 cents.\n\nRevenue of $1.45 billion did exceed the average analyst estimate of $1.37 billion. However, sales in Q2 were down 27% from the previous quarter. The company said that its results suffered due to a decline in trading volumes and losses on its crypto assets. Management said trading activity on its exchange has been subdued with crypto prices slumping and range bound over the past few months. COIN stock has fallen 20% since its Q2 print was made public making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "RIVN Stock Outlook: Can EV Startup Rivian Survive Its Cash Burn Crisis?",
        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN), the high-profile electric vehicle startup, has been a company I’ve watched with great interest since its blockbuster IPO in 2021. As one of the most well-funded EV startups, Rivian’s journey has been closely followed by investors hoping that Rivian stock could emerge as a viable challenger to Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) EV dominance.\n\nHowever, after digging into the company’s latest Q2 2024 earnings report, I believe Rivian’s path to profitability and long-term success remains highly uncertain.\n\nRivian’s Cash Burn Remains Alarming\n\nIn Q2, Rivian reported revenue of $1.16 billion, a modest 3.3% increase from a year ago. While top-line growth is always welcome, it was overshadowed by the company’s staggering net loss of $1.46 billion in the quarter. Let that sink in – Rivian’s net loss exceeded its total revenue!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn a per-vehicle basis, the numbers are even more concerning. Rivian is losing over $30,000 on every vehicle it sells, a sharp contrast to Tesla, which earns a hefty profit on each car. With Rivian’s cash and equivalents falling to $7.9 billion, the current burn rate gives the company a runway of only about two more years.\n\nRivian’s management has spoken about its drive towards profitability, with a goal of reaching positive gross margins by the fourth quarter of this year. However, with an operating margin of -105.9% over the trailing 12 months, Rivian has a long way to go.\n\nEven with potential interest rate cuts providing a tailwind, I struggle to see how Rivian can flip the switch to profitability anytime soon without massively sacrificing growth or further diluting shareholders.\n\nPartnerships Provide Some Hope, But Headwinds Remain\n\nTo its credit, Rivian has made some savvy strategic moves to improve its long-term prospects. A recently announced partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY), which includes a $5 billion investment, should help Rivian reduce costs and accelerate the development of its next-gen vehicles. The ongoing commercial van deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also provides some revenue stability.\n\nHowever, these partnerships don’t change Rivian’s harsh competitive reality. Tesla remains the 800-pound gorilla in the EV space, commanding the lion’s share of the market. Other established automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) are also heavily investing in EVs. Rivian will need to fight tooth and nail for every point of market share.\n\nSignificant macroeconomic and political risks are also on the horizon. With the potential of a Trump presidency starting in 2025, Rivian could face major headwinds if EV subsidies and incentives are rolled back. And while the Fed is expected to cut interest rates, it likely won’t be enough to drastically alter the demand for Rivian’s high-priced vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalyst Opinions and Price Targets\n\nAnalysts have mixed views on Rivian’s prospects. Needham recently cut its price target for RIVN to $18 from $20 while maintaining a “buy” rating. The firm cites high owner satisfaction with the R1 model and the partnership with Amazon for electric van deliveries as key demand drivers. However, Needham also acknowledges uncertainty in near-term demand for the R1 and the need to adjust consensus delivery estimates downward.\n\nOther analysts are more cautious. Cantor Fitzgerald notes that Rivian reported a less-than-expected gross margin loss in Q2, but the company still has a long way to go to reach profitability. InvestingPro tips highlight that while Rivian has more cash than debt, the company is quickly burning through its reserves.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Steer Clear of Rivian Stock For Now\n\nDespite the hype and potential, I believe investors should avoid Rivian stock in the current environment. The company’s cash burn and lack of profitability are too concerning, especially with a looming recession. In a major market sell-off, high-risk speculative stocks like RIVN are often the first to be punished.\n\nIn the long term, I’m still cautious about Rivian’s prospects. While partnerships with Volkswagen and Amazon provide some optimism, Rivian faces immense competitive threats from Tesla and other established automakers pivoting hard into EVs. Rivian will likely require additional dilutive capital raises to stay afloat, which could put further pressure on the stock.\n\nFor these reasons, I’m reiterating my “strong sell” rating on Rivian stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon axes a major fee for sellers ahead of the crucial holiday shopping rush",
        "content": "Amazonangered many longtime sellers earlier this year by tacking on two new fees that merchants said complicated their business operations, even for the most sophisticated of them. The furor was so extreme that the Federal Trade Commission contacted sellers about the fees amid the agency's antitrust suit against the tech giant.\n\nBut on Thursday, Amazon announced the elimination of another fee ahead of the holiday shopping season that impacted hundreds of thousands of U.S. sellers. The so-called \"overage\" fee penalized sellers whose inventory in Amazon warehouses exceeded the limit set by the company, either because customer demand had slowed or for other reasons.\n\n\"The fee removal is in part due to Amazon’s more effective capacity management features, and we are glad to be able to eliminate these fees and allow sellers to not worry about them as we head into peak,\" Amazon vice president Dharmesh Mehta wrote on LinkedIn, alluding to the busy holiday shopping season. \"We hope this will help more sellers ensure they have enough inventory ready for peak demand this holiday shopping season.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company will still set inventory capacity limits for sellers, but they will no longer be charged extra if sales are slow and their in-stock inventory exceeds their threshold. However, sellers will be unable to add to their inventory if their in-stock inventory plus in-transit restocks surpass their limit. The fee cancellation will be retroactive to July 1.\n\nThe holiday season will be crucial for Amazon and its sellers, who account for around 60% of total goods sold on the shopping platform and whose fees contributed $140 billion of revenue to the tech giant in 2023—or nearly a quarter of its total net sales.\n\nAmazon's stock price dropped more than 10% over the past week after its third-quarter sales forecast fell below analyst estimates. Amazon's chief financial officer blamed the shortfall on consumers being distracted from shopping by a busy news cycle and warned that shoppers are cautious about spending and are therefore buying less-expensive brands when possible.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon's rising seller fees have caused widespread angst among merchants using its platform, with outrage reaching a crescendo following the addition of two new U.S. fees earlier this year. One new fee penalized sellers who had too little inventory in stock. Another, known as the \"inbound placement\" fee, penalized sellers who didn't ship their inventory to at least four different Amazon warehouses. Previously, sellers could ship inventory to one Amazon facility and the tech giant would then foot the bill of transferring it between warehouses in its network.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast week, during an earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy referred to the new fee as \"the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money.\" He said the resulting seller behavior of shipping inventory to more Amazon warehouses to avoid the fee is \"getting more traction than we'd even hoped.\"\n\nOn LinkedIn, one Amazon seller responded to a post about Jassy's comments with an image of a carrot and a stick, signaling a belief that the fee creates more of a reward and punishment dynamic than a mere incentive.\n\n\"A refresher may be in order ahead of the next earnings call,\" the seller quipped with a winking emoji, alluding to a difference of opinion with Jassy's definition.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Is Testing Speedy Delivery Service Featuring Kia Souls",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has deployed a new secret weapon in its same-day delivery operation: a convoy of Kia Souls.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution How a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\n\nThe boxy little vehicles, already zooming around metro areas such as Seattle and Dallas, are a recent addition to the company’s six-year-old Delivery Service Partner initiative, which outsources the hiring and management of drivers to small contracting firms that typically lease Prime-branded trucks and vans.\n\nWhile van drivers mostly work full shifts hauling 200 or more packages, the Kia drivers are usually part-timers who might bring 50 items on a four- or five-hour shift, according to job postings and people familiar with the initiative.\n\nThe new service is designed to handle quick deliveries that the company currently delegates to its Amazon Flex gig economy service, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. Broadening out beyond the depots and delivery firms currently piloting the program could give Amazon greater control over deliveries and reduce its reliance on Flex, which has been criticized for treating workers unfairly — a charge the company denies.\n\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is determined to streamline and speed up Amazon’s logistics network, which doubled in size during the pandemic. The company has shuttered warehouses even as it continues to build massive new ones, and is staging goods at facilities closer to customers. Today, Amazon says fewer employees handle each package, which in turn allows them to make shorter trips.\n\nOn a call with analysts earlier this month, Jassy said there were “a number of opportunities to further reduce costs” in logistics, including increasing the use of automation and robotics and expanding the number of same-day delivery sites.\n\nAmazon pitched its new service, the Same Day Delivery Program for Delivery Service Partners, at a conference for contract drivers last September, according to one of the people. The company has launched or plans to launch the service in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Washington, according to the people and job postings. On a website for delivery contractors, Amazon says the program gives drivers more flexible working hours and routes “using smaller passenger vehicles or cargo vans.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’re always testing new ways to support our Delivery Service Partners, and multiple shorter routes in a given day is something that they have requested,” Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement. “This approach also supports our fast same-day orders that Prime customers love.”\n\nThe Kia Soul drivers deliver packages from what Amazon calls “sub-same day” warehouses, depots typically located closer to urban customers than the company’s massive fulfillment centers. Amazon last year said it would double the count of such facilities in the coming years, part of a push to stay ahead of big US retail rivals and upstarts like Temu and Shein that can’t typically match Amazon on delivery speed.\n\nThose sub-same day warehouses now primarily use Amazon Flex drivers, who drive their own vehicles. During periods of peak demand, they have earned as much as $30 a hour, relatively decent money for this kind of work. But four US-based Flex drivers, who requested anonymity to avoid alienating Amazon, say these so-called surge payments have grown vanishingly rare. Three of the drivers, who deliver in large metropolitan areas, say base pay rates at some warehouses they frequent have been cut in the last year. The company says US Flex drivers are paid more than $26 an hour.\n\nThe on-demand employment model, which Flex shares with Uber and DoorDash, remains controversial. Labor activists argue that drivers should be classified as Amazon employees entitled to health care and other benefits, claims drivers occasionally make in court. Some 16,000 Flex drivers filed arbitration claims earlier this year, arguing that Amazon wrongly denied them wages and other compensation. The company has said the program lets workers set their own schedules and be their own boss.\n\n“Amazon Flex is and will continue to play an integral role in our growing last-mile delivery network, and claims to the contrary are inaccurate,” spokesperson Kelly said.\n\nSpencer Patton, who advises Amazon delivery contractors, said shifting deliveries from Flex to Delivery Service Partners gives the company more control. DSPs are technically independent businesses and employ their drivers directly, but Amazon exercises a great deal of sway over how they operate. Patton also said that using part-timers driving inexpensive vehicles is much cheaper than paying delivery contractors using vans with higher fixed costs.\n\n“It make sense for Amazon,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The 77 awardees represent 38.5% of the 200 most popular scripted series, which is a decrease of 8.5% from last year and 20% from the peak in 2020-21. The Stamp acknowledges gender-balanced hiring and demonstrates the potential for every production—regardless of subject matter or the gender of its creator or lead talent—to achieve gender equity\n\nThe ReFrame TV Stamp, launched in 2018, is awarded to scripted series that hire women or people of other underrepresented genders (including those who are trans, nonbinary or gender nonconforming) in at least 50% of key roles including: showrunner, writers, directors, executive and line producers, leads, co-leads, and department heads. Additional points are awarded to productions that hire women of color in these positions, and to those with overall gender parity in their crews. View full criteria here.\n\nReFrame founders, Keri Putnam and Cathy Schulman, responded to this year’s data, \"ReFrame is thrilled to congratulate the 77 series that achieved equity in their hiring this year. However, 38.5% of series reaching this benchmark falls far short of the 100% fair hiring standard we should all aspire to. The ReFrame Stamp’s criteria of gender balanced hiring should be the goal of all productions.\" They continued, \"Positive trends in mitigating bias often flatline or roll-back after a period of progress. It’s a testament to the efforts of many across the field that there are nearly twice as many Stamped series this year as when we began in 2018, but the drop of 20% over the last four years indicates a troubling trend. If this pace of reduction continues, all the progress made in diversifying the talent shaping media in the U.S. will be erased in two years.\"\n\nCEO of WIF and ReFrame Council Member Kirsten Schaffer added, \"The contraction in the business resulted in 204 fewer episodes across the Top 200 series than in prior years analyzed. This should impact writers and directors equally, with lost jobs split evenly between men and women but this year’s findings suggest that women are disproportionately impacted and demands further study.\" ReFrame Council Member and Founding Senior Director of Artist Programs at Sundance Institute Michelle Satter concluded, \"The value of a pipeline of support for underrepresented storytellers on both sides of the camera cannot be understated. Renewed attention to inclusion, collaboration and transparency are needed for our field to be equitable.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nKey findings of the full ReFrame Report on Gender and Hiring in TV, released today and determined by ReFrame’s extensive analysis of IMDbPro data, include:\n\nLead cast surpassed the 50% mark last year with 54% of lead roles being portrayed by women or gender diverse performers; this year representation dropped to 41% (13% decrease). Pilot writing and directing jobs and their many financial benefits remain primarily in men’s hands and pockets. There is a consistent average gap of nearly 12% for directors and 14% for writers year-over-year in hiring for pilot episodes versus episodes overall. Of the 102 pilot episodes in this year’s list, 26 (25.5%) were directed by women, including one trans woman, and 33 (32.4%) were written by women. All 13 series in the top 200 that are showrun by women of color obtained the ReFrame Stamp. Though any project can achieve the Stamp through gender-balanced hiring in key positions, there is still an overwhelming correlation between showrunner identity and overall equity. Nearly 60% of Stamped series are showrun by women, compared to 32.5% of series overall. This year’s gains were for line producers, directors of photography, composers and intimacy coordinators. With the exception of intimacy coordinators (where qualifying candidates hold 49% of positions), even with this year’s increases, women and gender-diverse people hold fewer than 20% of positions in these other important roles. Of the 77 series receiving the Stamp, 59 (76.6%) were released on streaming services, 9 (11.7%) on cable and 9 (11.7%) on networks. For the third consecutive year, the majority of Emmy Nominees for Outstanding Comedy Series received the Stamp. Five of the eight (Abbott Elementary, The Bear, Hacks, Reservation Dogs and What We Do in the Shadows) met the gender-balanced production criteria as well as three of the eight nominated series in the Outstanding Drama category (Fallout, The Morning Show and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and three of the five Limited or Anthology Series (Baby Reindeer, Lessons in Chemistry, True Detective: Night Country).\n\nThe ReFrame Report includes a company report card which further breaks out the streaming, network and cable shows captured in the Top 200 to determine the percentage of series from each distributor that met ReFrame Stamp criteria. With the exception of Amazon MGM Studios (which had 60.9% of their series this year meet ReFrame Stamp criteria), every distributor reflects a lower percentage of gender-balanced series than in 2020-21 (the first year this data was collected).\n\nThe ReFrame Report also highlights actionable resources that empower studios and distributors to find historically excluded cast and crew to hire and collaborate with. The ReFrame ReSource includes more than 100 tools, best practices and insights highlighting the work of countless advocacy experts and organizations. Decision-makers can discover and hire inclusively with IMDbPro and its advanced search feature, which is available to all IMDbPro Premium members. Professionals can find cast and crew based on self-identified demographic information, including gender/gender identity and race/ethnicity. IMDbPro members with a claimed name page can self-identify this information, which is intended to support talent, particularly from under-represented communities, looking to be discovered and advance their careers.\n\nTo determine the 2023-24 Stamp recipients, ReFrame examined IMDbPro data on the 200 most popular narrative television and streaming shows with a full season of episodes released during the Emmys eligibility period of June 1, 2023 – May 31, 2024. See the full list here. Each show was considered for the list based on its top-performing four weeks during the eligibility period on the IMDbPro proprietary ranking of titles, factoring in the removal of sports, news, non-fiction and reality programs. IMDbPro rankings are based on the actual page views of the more than 250 million monthly visitors to IMDb worldwide. IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for information on movies, TV shows and celebrities, and its vast and authoritative database features more than 500 hundred million searchable data items.\n\nReFrame encourages all productions to implement equitable hiring practices and apply to earn the ReFrame Stamp year-round. Through an open application process, numerous television and streaming productions outside of the Top 200 earned the Stamp in 2023-24, including The Ms. Pat Show: Season 3 (BET+), SKYMED: Season 2 (CBS), The Other Black Girl: Season 1 (Hulu) and Station 19: Season 7 (ABC). The list of all 2023-24 Stamped shows is available below, on ReFrame’s website and at IMDb.com/ReFrame.\n\nAbout ReFrame\n\nFounded and led by Sundance Institute and WIF (formerly known as Women In Film, Los Angeles), ReFrame is an initiative that employs a unique strategy: a peer-to-peer approach, in which ReFrame Ambassadors engage with senior industry decision-makers at over 50 Partner Companies to implement ReFrame systemic change programs.

        "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery tanks after massive impairment charge, Wall Street says 'unlikely' things can get worse",
        "content": "Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) stock price fell as much as 12% in early trading on Thursday after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that missed expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe company took a massive $9.1 billion impairment charge related to its TV networks unit following the loss of a key media rights deal with the NBA. The company filed a lawsuit against the league over what it said was the NBA's \"unjustified rejection\" of the company's matching rights proposal.\n\nIncluding an additional $2.1 billion in costs related to its merger, the company took an $11.2 billion hit in write-downs and charges last quarter. Additionally, the company reversed earlier profit trends in its streaming business despite adding nearly 4 million subscribers in the quarter, while its linear TV unit continued to deteriorate.\n\nWall Street analysts on Thursday weighed in on the report, with at least one suggesting it's \"unlikely\" things can get worse for the media giant.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel, who has an Overweight rating on shares, said the company's studios business will likely perform better in 2025 compared to 2024 while streaming can continue to offset accelerated linear network declines.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav maintained on the company's earnings call that profitability within its streaming unit will be positive in the second half of the year with \"even greater subscriber growth\" in the current quarter and \"at least\" $1 billion in segment EBITDA in 2025.\n\nStill, Zaslav pointed to shifting industry dynamics as a key catalyst for impairment charge, telling investors on the earnings call, \"It's fair to say that even two years ago, market valuations and prevailing conditions for legacy media companies were quite different than they are today. This impairment acknowledges this and better aligns our carrying values with our future outlook.\"\n\nWBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels added the second quarter saw a \"number of triggering events, including the difference between our current market cap and the book value of the company, the continued softness in the US ad market and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA.\"\n\n\"While I am certainly not dismissive of the magnitude of this impairment, I believe it's equally important to recognize that the flip side of this reflects the value shift across business models and our conviction and confidence in the growth and value opportunity across studios and our global direct to consumer business,\" he said.\n\nStory continues Warner Bros. Discovery has struggled in recent quarters, with profits hit by a weak linear advertising environment and pressure on affiliate fees REUTERS/Eric Gaillard/File Photo (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $9.7 billion, missing Bloomberg consensus expectations of $10.12 billion and a 6% drop compared to the $10.36 billion seen last year.\n\nThe company reported an adjusted loss per share of $4.07 versus a loss $0.51 in the year-earlier period and below consensus estimates of $0.21 as a result of the impairment charge.\n\nFree cash flow, which served as a bright spot in the first quarter, bucked that trend this time around. The metric dropped 43% year over year to $976 million and also missed Bloomberg consensus expectations of $1.2 billion.\n\nThe company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming business served as a bright spot in the quarter. It added 3.6 million Max subscribers amid the debut of \"House of the Dragon\" Season 2. This was ahead of Bloomberg consensus expectations of 1.89 million and also ahead of the 1.80 million subs added in Q2 2023.\n\nStreaming advertising revenue jumped to $240 million, beating Bloomberg estimates of $191 million and up 98% from the $121 million the company reported in the year-ago period. The DTC division, however, posted a loss of $107 million after reporting a profit in the first quarter.\n\nFuture unclear amid linear struggles\n\nIn its latest media rights negotiations, the NBA passed on WBD in favor of two newcomers: tech giant Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). The league was able to strike a new rights agreement with its other current media partner, Disney (DIS). WBD's current rights will expire at the end of next season.\n\nAnalysts have warned the loss of these rights will impact the future success of its streaming service Max and will likely quicken the demise of its linear networks, which are already in free fall.\n\nNetwork advertising revenue tumbled by 10% in Q2 from the year-earlier period. The company reported network ad revenue of $2.21 billion, missing Bloomberg expectations of $2.26 billion.\n\nThat pressured second quarter EBITDA, with full-year adjusted EBITDA now at risk of falling below $10 billion, according to the latest Bloomberg estimates. That's $4 billion below what analysts had expected at the time of the merger. The stage set for the first 2024 debate between U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 26, 2024, in this handout picture. John Nowak/CNN/Handout via REUTERS/File photo (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nRumors have swirled about the company's next move, with Bank of America analysts laying out possible strategic options in a recent report that could include a split of the company's digital streaming and studio businesses from its legacy linear TV unit.\n\nManagement skirted around the topic of a split during the earnings call, but did seem to acknowledge that it's been discussed.\n\n\"This is a public company. We're all very well aware of our responsibility to have a view on whatever strategic options are out there,\" Wiedenfels said. \"We are very clearly focused on evaluating everything beyond just running the operational business.\"\n\nStill, the company said it's been operating under the \"under the one Warner Bros. Discovery strategy for for the past two and a half year. ...and every day we’re seeing the benefits.”\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the king of artificial intelligence (AI) investing for now, but it doesn't mean it will stay in that position forever. Right now, it's on top because its clients buy thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) and place them in giant data centers to produce and train AI models.\n\nEventually, this demand will decline as companies build out their capacity, making way for the next wave of AI investments. As a result, I think there are three companies that could be worth more than Nvidia five years from now. They are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Although the climb won't be easy, I think they can displace Nvidia.\n\nTaiwan Semi will win regardless of which company sits atop the AI throne\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor may be a surprise pick here, as it's significantly smaller than Nvidia right now (Nvidia is valued at $2.6 trillion versus TSMC's $775 billion). However, some tailwinds will push TSMC higher.\n\nFirst, Taiwan Semiconductor is more diversified than Nvidia. Nvidia is basically a one-trick pony with its GPUs and products that complement them. Taiwan Semi may also be a one-trick pony because all it does is produce chips, but the use case for those chips is so wide that it ends up being diversified. For example, Apple is one of Taiwan Semi's largest customers and could see a huge demand ramp-up soon as Apple Intelligence is only available on the latest generation of iPhones.\n\nSecond, TSMC is working on its 2nm (nanometer) chips, which are capable of the same performance as its 3nm predecessors, except that they consume 25% to 30% less power. That's a huge performance gain, and it will drive the next generation of hardware used to process AI models.\n\nHowever, will the next generation of AI models be run on Nvidia hardware? Not necessarily.\n\nApple Intelligence isn't using Nvidia GPUs. Instead, it's using Alphabet's tensor processing units (TPUs). While this may come as a surprise to some investors, it shouldn't. Nvidia GPUs are fantastic at being flexible and processing various workloads. However, there are more efficient ways to train AI models if the workload is set up properly. That's why Alphabet's TPUs can be a better choice than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nFor most of its customers, these TPUs can only be accessed through Google Cloud. As programmers get better at setting up AI models for efficient calculations, this will shift the workloads from GPUs to hardware specifically designed for processing AI, like TPUs. So, all of the technology that TSMC is innovating may end up being used in products like TPUs instead of GPUs, which could cause Alphabet to rise and Nvidia to tumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut how does Amazon fit in?\n\nAmazon and Alphabet are remarkably similar businesses\n\nWhile most know Amazon as its dominant commerce platform, it's actually the largest provider of cloud computing infrastructure globally. Like Alphabet, Amazon also has purpose-built custom chips to optimize AI training.\n\nIt will benefit from the same tailwinds that will push Alphabet higher in the next few years, except that the effect may be even more profound as Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes up a higher percentage of Amazon's operating profits than Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's commerce business is still doing well. This is another similarity to Alphabet, as Alphabet has huge growth drivers in the AI space, but its advertising business continues to print money. As Amazon's commerce business continues to grow and become more efficient, Amazon will turn into an even larger business, potentially surpassing Nvidia within five years.\n\nWhile Nvidia has undoubtedly won the first round of AI investing, there are still many to go. As companies shift to load-specific hardware, I think companies like Amazon and Alphabet will succeed, bringing Taiwan Semiconductor (the maker of these chips) along with them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Fintech looks to be the next big thing. It is incorporating elements from every sector, from hardware (card readers) to software (online payment processing) and now AI in fraud detection. With this, new opportunities to make money arise, and investors should be cautious about how they participate in these opportunities.\n\nThe financial technology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% until 2029, making it a sector investors should consider. However, like any high-return opportunity, investing in fintech companies carries significant risk. To mitigate those risks, it is important to stay informed and keep an open mind about the general consensus regarding investments.\n\nKnowing when to sell is just as important as knowing when to buy. That said, here are three companies that I believe you should offload for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is a company that offers financial solutions to consumers and businesses. It operates Square and CashApp, both of which are leading payment interfaces. While it operates primarily in the United States, it also provides its services internationally.\n\nWhile SQ’s revenue is increasing significantly, profit isn’t keeping pace. Although the company posted a year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 11.2%, it only had a profit margin of 2.9%. In addition to a return on assets of 1.12%, both metrics are significantly lower than those of its competitors. Insiders only own 0.8% of SQ’s shares. The percentage is quite low relative to other companies and is a negative indicator.\n\nThe company is reportedly reorganizing soon. This will prove to be a big shift for employees, as layoffs are also part of the plan. The long-term impact of these moves creates uncertainty for Block, with their full effect yet to be priced in. For now, investors should be weary and might want to consider selling portions of their investments.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Affirm financial stocks to sell\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) operates primarily as a digital sales facilitator and has point-of-sale terminals. However, one of its most notable features is that it allows consumers to spread payments out — if you’ve ever shopped on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), you’ve likely noticed a “Pay with Affirm” pop-up on your screen. It trades at $24.16, representing a market cap below $7.5 billion.\n\nWhile revenue has been on a progressive uptrend over the last four years, it is important to note that losses have been, too. Additionally, the company currently has a debt/equity ratio of 20.89. The company is operating on significant leverage, which could be a big risk in the long run. Additionally, analysts have lowered EPS predictions recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAFRM faces multiple threats. From a point-of-sales standpoint, there are numerous competing services. Apple Pay is a big contender. AFRM also faces stiff competition in the buy now sell later space, with companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) allegedly coming out with improvements to Apple Pay Later. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) also offers a pay-later service. Due to this, I think that AFRM will face significant challenges in the future and is a stock you should sell.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) An image of the logo for Coinbase Global Inc (COIN).\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the most recognizable crypto exchanges. For readers unfamiliar with the concept of a crypto exchange, think about where you invest your money — just like your broker, crypto exchanges facilitate cryptocurrency trading. As of the market close on 8/6, COIN is trading for $194.17, giving it a slightly over $48 billion valuation.\n\nWhile the company is experiencing solid growth, with revenue surging over 100% in Q2, profits remain nonexistent. The company only barely made a profit in fiscal year 2023. With a beta of 3.4, this company remains a volatile investment. COIN also significantly missed Q2 EPS estimates by $0.79.\n\nThis brings me to my main point—the revenue COIN collects directly affects crypto prices, particularly those of more popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC). This is because it collects revenue on each transaction made on a percentage basis, and thus, generally, if the price of crypto is higher, it will collect more revenue. This represents a significant risk for investors, and thus, any investors who don’t accept this should consider selling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Stock to Buy on the Dip After Earnings?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a “little bit of a reset, obviously.” The analyst said that AI stocks had a “great run” and the latest pullback is a “typical process” of market rotation.\n\n“It doesn’t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that’s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,” Landsberg said.\n\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said “absolutely not” and called the recent pullback “deceleration” from growth and “normalization.”\n\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will “separate the wheat from the chaff” and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\n\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nJeff Bezos of Amazon\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company’s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Hypergrowth Company Will Be Wall Street's First $6 Trillion Stock -- and It's Not Nvidia!",
        "content": "Change is one of the only constants investors will find on Wall Street. Thanks to a combination of innovation, acquisitions, mergers, bankruptcies, legal judgments, competition, and even Acts of God, the stock market's \"leaderboard\" is constantly in flux. This is to say that Wall Street's largest companies today aren't liable to hold their positions five, 10, or even 20 years from now.\n\nJust six years ago, tech goliath Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made history by becoming the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market cap. By June 2023, it had crossed the psychological $3 trillion barrier. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt took less than five years for the stock market's largest company to triple in value, which begs the question: Which hypergrowth company will be the first to double the current peak of a little over $3 trillion in market cap and reach a $6 trillion valuation?\n\nWhile I'll give you my very clear prediction in a moment, let me work my way backwards and show why some of today's most-influential businesses within the \"Magnificent Seven\" aren't the answer.\n\nNvidia and Apple? No chance.\n\nConsidering that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest thing since sliced bread, you'd think AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would have the inside track to becoming Wall Street's most-valuable business. However, I've been pointing out for months just how many headwinds the ace of the AI movement is set to face.\n\nDespite having superior AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) with top-notch compute ability, Nvidia's inability to satisfy all of its customers will open the door for external competitors to grab market share.\n\nLikewise, all four of Nvidia's largest customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, they're going to take up valuable data center space and lessen the need for Nvidia's hardware in the years to come.\n\nThe biggest worry might just be that every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years has navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. With most businesses lacking a clear gameplan with their AI investments, it looks probable that the AI bubble will burst sooner than later, and ultimately drag Nvidia down with it.\n\nAs for Apple, its growth engine has mostly stalled out. Net sales are up by about 1% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). Although a record-breaking buyback program has been a major help to Apple's bottom line, it makes no sense for investors to pay a high multiple to earnings if Apple's sales growth is hardly above the flatline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile subscription services continue to be a bright spot -- up 13.2% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023 -- lagging iPhone sales are liable to drag on Apple's share price.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms? Possibly, but ample headwinds exist.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) do have a path to a $6 trillion valuation, but would need things to go just right for it to happen.\n\nMicrosoft enjoys sustainable moats and exorbitant cash flow from its legacy Windows and Office segments, and should deliver double-digit sales growth from Azure, the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. With plenty of cash on hand, Microsoft can easily invest for the future via organic or inorganic means.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is also heavily tied to the AI revolution via its investments in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT. If the AI bubble were to burst, as I expect it will, it could be hit harder than other \"Magnificent Seven\" members, aside from Nvidia.\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet should benefit nicely from the growth of its cloud infrastructure service platform known as Google Cloud. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early innings, which bodes well for this high-margin operating segment.\n\nThe only true knock I have against Alphabet is its strongly cyclical ties. With roughly 76% of its $84.7 billion in second-quarter sales derived from advertising, Alphabet will always be somewhat tethered to the health of the U.S. and global economy, as well as investor sentiment.\n\nComparatively, Meta Platforms is even more reliant on advertising. Just shy of 98% of its $75.5 billion in net sales through the first-half of 2024 have come from ads on its social media platforms.\n\nAlthough long-winded economic expansions are a positive for Meta's ad-driven operating model, and the company's metaverse investments have a chance to pay off in a big way in the latter-half of this decade, its stock would have to quintuple in value to become Wall Street's first $6 trillion company. This seems a stretch given the potential for U.S. economic growth to slow in the coming quarters. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $6 trillion stock is likely to be...\n\nThough it's going to take some time -- i.e., don't expect the stock market's outsized annual returns to continue indefinitely -- my prediction is that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will cut the proverbial ribbon and cross the $6 trillion threshold before any other publicly traded company.\n\nWhile most people have acquainted themselves with Amazon through its globally leading online marketplace, the nuts-and-bolts that generate the bulk of the company's operating cash flow have little to do with e-commerce.\n\nFirst and foremost, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. AWS held a 31% share of cloud infrastructure services spending as of the end of 2023, with annual run-rate sales topping $105 billion, as of June 30. This segment is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, and it should play a key role in doubling Amazon's operating cash flow by 2026.\n\nAmazon is also just beginning to harness the value of its content via its Prime subscription service. Landing an 11-year streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), coupled with being the exclusive partner of Thursday Night Football, makes Amazon's video platform the wave of the future. It should have no trouble increasing Prime subscription prices, as well as generating boatloads of advertising revenue.\n\nSpeaking of advertising services, Amazon is seeing north of 3 billion visits to its website on a monthly basis. Since many visitors to Amazon are motivated shoppers, businesses are willing to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered year-over-year constant-currency sales growth of at least 20% dating back more than two years.\n\nEven if the AI bubble bursts and takes Nvidia and Microsoft down with it, Amazon's various fast-growing ancillary channels can sustain double-digit growth.\n\nWhat's more, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock during the 2010s. Investors in Amazon today are only paying 11.5 times forecast cash flow for 2025. If Amazon were to be valued at the same median cash-flow multiple it carried throughout the 2010s, and it continues to grow at its existing pace, it would have the clearest path to a $6 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

(VFC) amid consumer pullback in discretionary spending.\n\nRalph Lauren's more refined assortment of high-end styles drove consumers into its stores globally — particularly in Europe, Japan, and China. Sales lifts from Ralph Lauren outfitting the US Olympics team and other events like the US Open also aided performance.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear wherever you look that the overall consumer is being pressured by the cumulative effect of inflationary pressures and interest rates,\" Ralph Lauren CEO Patrice Louvet told me on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination Overtime.\n\n\"As far as our core consumer is concerned, we actually find them to be very resilient.\"\n\nRalph Lauren exited the quarter with inventory levels down 13%, while also reaffirming its sale and profit goals for the fiscal year.\n\n\"Solid [earnings] print with much better than expected results in Europe, North America a bit softer (but some timing shift impact), and Asia strong and in-line with the street (a positive given the negative noises from other consumer companies there recently).

Comparable sales at its physical stores increased 3%.\n\n\"So we've basically guided that this year we'll close about 45 doors in total. I think over the next two to three years, we'll probably close 150 doors,\" Louvet said.\n\n\"We're really clear that we're working for the long term. We're working to make sure that this brand comes through in all the touch-points consistent with Ralph's vision.

        "title": "Rivian Investors, Take Note: 2 Key Drivers That Could Boost RIVN’s Profit Outlook",
        "content": "Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) has greatly reduced its costs and continues to expect to generate positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year and in all of 2025.\n\nThere are multiple signs that the company’s brand remains extremely strong, driven by great, widespread appreciation for its EVs. Importantly, the automaker continues to have tremendous opportunities on many fronts. These include its partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY); the launch of its new, less expensive EVs; its plans to enter Europe on a significant scale and signing new deals with large companies. Given this, I remain very bullish on the longer-term outlook of Rivian stock. I recommend that long-term investors buy the shares.\n\nOn a negative note, I was disappointed that the company’s deal withMorgan Olson, announced early this year, does not yet seem to have generated revenue for Rivian. But considering an automobile’s long production cycle, I still expect the agreement to move the needle for Rivian.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRivian Is Making Meaningful Financial Progress\n\nAs I noted earlier, in conjunction with today’s release of Q2 financial, Rivian reaffirmed its commitment to generating positive gross margins in Q4 and in all of 2025. To move towards fulfilling this goal, the automaker has taken many steps to reduce its production costs.\n\nFor example, Rivian meaningfully lowered its material costs through technology and new deals with suppliers. It also cut commodity costs and sped up its production line by about 30%. Additionally, it plans to increase its gross margins by selling more EVs, lowering its depreciation expenses, selling used EVs for the first time and selling more regulatory credits. Moreover, Rivian intends to increase its revenue per vehicle by offering new, more expensive R1 EVs that feature a more high-powered engine called the Tri-Motor.\n\nThe automaker is already making progress on reducing its gross loss per EV sold. The metric fell to $32,705 in Q2 from $38,784 in Q1. Additionally, about $14,000 of the loss per EV represents non-cash costs such as depreciation and stock compensation. Moreover, Rivian has not yet sold many of its next-generation EVs that cost meaningfully less to produce, CFO Claire McDonough explained.\n\nContinued Brand Strength and Huge Opportunities\n\nSigns continue to mount that Rivian’s EVs are well-appreciated and the company’s brand power continues to improve. For example, CEO RJ Scaringe noted on the automaker’s Q2 earnings call that J.D. Power, in its annual APEAL Study that examines brand strength and product performance, rated Rivian as the top automaker.\n\nRivian expects its deal with Volkswagen to lower its costs by enabling it to pay less for supplies. And the joint venture the companies are establishing should generate significant revenue for Rivian. Additionally, Volkswagen has already invested $4 billion in Rivian. It is expected to provide the U.S. firm with another $4 billion.\n\nScaringe noted the automaker has made “some deliveries” of its delivery van in Germany. Yet the automaker is developing its upcoming R2 and R3 EVs to enable them to be sold in Europe. In light of higher EV adoption rates there than in the U.S., Rivian should generate large amounts of revenue there. That should lift its stock.\n\nSpeaking of the R2 and R3, Scaringe stated these EVs, whose starting price will be $45,000 or less, will be “capturing a sweet spot in terms of addressing demand for midsize SUVs in the U.S. and Europe.” Since the SUVs, which are slated to be launched starting in 2026, are relatively inexpensive, I agree with his assessment.\n\nFinally, the CEO noted Rivian continued running pilot programs with companies other than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that might buy its delivery vans. I expect the sales of these vans to eventually move the needle on the top and bottom lines for the firm, lifting Rivian stock.\n\nOne Disappointing Omission\n\nIn the past, I’ve touted Rivian’s deal to provide its platform to van maker Morgan Olson and a subsequent deal by the latter to build vans for Canada Post using the platform. I was disappointed to see Rivian hadn’t produced revenue from the agreement last quarter. Since producing EVs generally takes a long time to start, the delay doesn’t surprise me. I still expect the Morgan Olson deal to lift Rivian stock over the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in RIVN and AMZN.

        "title": "Amazon, Etsy see the election distracting an already weakening consumer",
        "content": "Election headlines have been coming so fast and furious that they’re drawing consumers’ attention away from shopping at a time the industry is already vulnerable because of a hit to discretionary spending.\n\nThat’s the early indication from retail giants this earnings season.\n\nEtsy, for one, pulled its fourth quarter forecast because the macro environment is unpredictable, CEO Josh Silverman told Yahoo Finance.\n\n“We have an election that’s been incredibly mindshare-consuming, and I expect, unfortunately, that that’s going to get worse. And the macro continues to be very volatile,” Silverman said.\n\nEtsy stock fell more than 7% after the online marketplace reported second quarter net income that missed estimates and said gross merchandise sales — the total value of goods sold through the platform — would fall in the low-single-digit range this quarter.\n\nAmazon, for its part, reported online sales rose 4.6% last quarter, slightly shy of estimates, and cited a “cautious consumer.” CFO Brian Olsavsky said the news cycle has been an additional factor.\n\n“When high-profile things happen, or the assassination attempt a couple of weeks ago, you see that people shift their attention to news. It’s more about distractions,” he told reporters on a media call.\n\nWhile e-commerce companies like Etsy and Amazon have already reported, traditional retail earnings don’t pick up until about the third week of August. One early bricks-and-mortar indication came from Tractor Supply (TSCO). Executives on its earnings call said that elections don't usually cause much change in performance — but that this upcoming election will make its fourth quarter tough to predict.\n\nAnalysts agree that the backdrop is challenging.\n\nNick Jones, managing director of internet equity research at Citizens JMP, said it’s difficult to quantify the effect of the news cycle and political developments specifically, but the general environment is weighing on spending.\n\n“The macro is absolutely dominating the market, and absolutely dominating people’s conversations,” Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets said in a phone interview. He’s a managing director and senior analyst covering retail and e-commerce, and said election news is just one element contributing to shoppers’ sentiment, in addition to unemployment, residual inflation, and geopolitics.\n\nBoth analysts said that spending won’t come to a halt and there’s still room for outperformance.\n\n“I think people will be distracted for sure, but people will still consume. If emotions are inflamed, people might opt for the more comfortable experience,” Jones said. That could mean sticking with reliable giants like Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause distracted or distressed consumers are being more choosy, retailers have to work harder, Siegel said. “Companies aren’t being gifted revenues, they need to fight and earn them. Simply being, and simply being large, is not the path to winning,” he said. They need to offer “compelling product or experience or value.”\n\nHome Depot kicks off retail earnings on Aug. 13, and things heat up the following week with results from TJX (TJX), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Macy’s (M), and Gap (GPS).\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance's Market Domination and Market Domination: Overtime.

        "title": "MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL: Big Tech’s Big Spend on AI",
        "content": "The thrust for artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating with each passing day. The big tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL), are deploying more and more funds toward AI infrastructure, as indicated by their latest quarterly filings. Specifically, each of them has set massive capital expenditure goals, with the aim to reap significant benefits that AI promises to bring in the future. Let’s take a closer look at how much these big tech companies have spent on AI in the June quarter.\n\nMicrosoft(MSFT) – A big supporter and investor of ChatGPT, Microsoft has integrated the OpenAI software in almost all of its products. In Q4 FY24, MSFT spent $13.9 billion on property and equipment, which included cloud and AI-related spending. Nearly 50% of this amount is for data centers, which is expected to generate rewards over the next 15 years, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted. Moreover, Hood pointed out that the company expects spending more in Fiscal 2025, toward cloud and AI segments to meet the burgeoning demand.\n\nAlphabet(GOOGL) – Alphabet has not had an easy way like Microsoft. Alphabet had to build its AI model, Gemini, from scratch and seems to have done a pretty good job so far. For reference, Gemini was used by over 1.5 million developers in Q2. In Q2 FY24, Alphabet spent $13 billion in capex, most of which was directed toward servers and data centers. Alphabet’s CFO Ruth Porat stated that the company expects quarterly capex of $12 billion or more throughout the year. As CEO Sundar Pichai puts it, “When you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.”\n\nMeta Platforms(META) – Meta Platforms reported a capex of $8.5 billion for Q2 FY24, which included investment in network infrastructure, servers, and data centers. The company built its own AI model called Llama and launched its Llama 3.1 version last month. For Fiscal 2024, Meta revised its capex guidance range to $37 to $40 billion from $35-$40 billion, as the company focuses on AI research and product development.\n\nAdditionally, CFO Susan Li stated that Meta expects to incur significant capex growth in 2025 to support its AI ambitions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that Llama 4 model will require 10x more compute than Llama 3, with even higher computing power required for future models. Accordingly, Zuckerberg said, “At this point I’d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.”\n\nAmazon.com(AMZN) – Amazon’s cloud service provider, AWS (Amazon Web Service), offers servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security services. The company spent a massive $30.5 billion in capex in the first half of 2024. Amazon intends to spend more on capex in the second half of the year, especially toward AWS infrastructure to support both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is creating its own AI chatbot, called Metis to compete with ChatGPT. Metis will be powered by Amazon’s own AI model, Olympus. CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings call, “I think that the reality right now is that while we’re investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today.”\n\nApple(AAPL) – Apple spends the least on AI among these big tech firms, as it is not developing its own generative AI model. Instead, the company has planned to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products. Apple recently announced Apple Intelligence, a system built on years of investments and research in AI and machine learning. The launch date of Apple Intelligence Features was recently delayed to October. The company only did a soft launch for developers to test the features and help fix bugs, if any.\n\nAfter understanding the current and future investments in AI, let’s compare these tech firms using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Plunges 19.1% in a Month: Should You Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Amazon AMZN has seen its stock plunge 19.1% in the past month. This drop is wider than the 15.3% and 7.4% declines of the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry and the S&P 500, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe AMZN stock has taken a sharp downturn, which can be primarily attributed to its lower-than-expected second-quarter 2024 revenues. Although strength in Prime, growing relationships with third-party seller and accelerating online store sales were positive, foreign exchange headwinds and changing consumer spending patterns were concerning.\n\nThe e-commerce giant provided weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance. It expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, the mid-point of which ($156.25 billion) was below the expectation on Aug 1. The mid-point is also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.03 billion.\n\nConsumers’ growing preference for lower-ticket items, such as everyday essentials and consumables, and avoiding luxury or expensive purchases are hurting Amazon’s sales growth. It has also been observed that consumers nowadays tend to wait longer to make a purchase or discard their cart completely. The reasons behind this unusual distraction of customers remain macro headwinds, high inflation and gearing up for national events like the presidential election.\n\nOne-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis situation has put investors at a crossroads, raising the question: is it time to buy, hold or sell the AMZN stock?\n\nAlthough the downturn in the retail business remains a major concern for the company, its dominant position in the booming cloud computing market on the back of continued strength in the cloud computing business — Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) — remains encouraging. In second-quarter 2024, AWS revenues rose 19% year over year to $26.3 billion (18% of net sales), driven by strengthening generative AI capabilities.\n\nGenerative AI Strength: Key Catalyst\n\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nThe company recently introduced Bedrock innovations, including custom model import and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails. These features are designed to provide customers a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications.\r\n\r\nWith a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.\r\n\r\nAWS also offers a generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe company’s collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter’s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Clientele Drives Growth\n\nAWS is witnessing solid customer momentum on the back of its strengthening generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe latest collaboration of Exscientia EXAI with AWS remains noteworthy. Per the terms, Exscientia is expanding the use of AWS’s AI and machine learning services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost. It is leveraging generative AI models of AWS to design drug candidates efficiently. It has deployed generative AI in its DesignStudio. EXAI draws on large language models via Amazon Bedrock.\r\n\r\nSAP recently teamed up with AWS to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning applications. SAP integrates generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. It is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases.\r\n\r\nBrightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nSmartsheet has also implemented Amazon Q Business to introduce a generative AI-powered assistant for its employees.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry leverages Amazon Bedrock to power its generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 AWS revenues is pegged at $106.6 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 17.4%.\r\n\r\nExpanding clientele will also continue to help AWS sustain its dominant position in the global cloud market, and gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\n\nImpressive Long-term Projections\n\nAmazon’s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from the solid momentum in AWS, primarily driven by growing generative AI capabilities. An expanding data center network, a strong portfolio, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones remain a plus.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.78 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.73 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 62.1%. The estimate has been revised upward by 2.8% over the past seven days and 3.3% over the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon, being the cloud giant, presents a solid investment opportunity due to its deepening focus on generative AI, AI integration and innovative product development.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish growth in e-commerce sales. Geo-political tensions, foreign exchange headwinds, recessionary fears, high inflation and regional labor market constraints are concerning for its retail business.\r\n\r\nMoreover, AMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 2.49X compared with the industry’s 1.75X, reflecting a stretched valuation. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company’s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact. However, new investors should consider waiting for a more attractive entry point, possibly on further dips, to ensure that they are not overpaying for future growth.\n\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Amazon is reviving an obscure entry-level interview procedure: ‘Bar raisers’",
        "content": "Many software engineers dream of working for one of the elite FAANG companies—Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But interview processes are rigorous across the board, ensuring only the most qualified candidates are hired.\n\nAnd at Amazon, the bar is even higher—literally. The e-commerce giant has had a unique hiring practice in place since the late 1990s called “bar raisers,” where an interviewer who typically sits on another team serves as an objective third-party adviser during the hiring process. There were a whopping 3,600 bar raisers at Amazon as of October 2019, but they had been removed from the interview process for entry-level software engineers in recent years during a pandemic hiring boom.\n\nBut Amazon is reinstating bar raisers into the interview process for entry-level software engineering jobs, called “SDE-1 (L4)” roles, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\n“We’re constantly reviewing and improving our hiring practices to ensure we’re hiring the best talent to innovate for our customers,” Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, told Fortune.\n\nAmazon declined to say whether removing bar raisers from the SDE-1 roles had led to a drop in talent quality, as Business Insider reporting suggests. However, reinstating the bar-raisers program for these roles “is addressing a direct business need and aims to enhance the quality of SDE-1 candidates hired,” according to the memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWhat are bar raisers?\n\nThere are thousands of bar raisers at Amazon who volunteer their time contributing to the interview process. They undergo a rigorous training process, sitting in on dozens of interviews before officially entering the program. Bar raisers aren’t paid extra for the work they contribute as part of the interview process.\n\n“These individuals, who are typically experienced employees from different departments, are trained to evaluate candidates not just for the immediate role but also for long-term potential and overall fit with Amazon's culture,” Tearra Bourgeois, a former Amazon human resources business partner, told Fortune. “They bring an objective perspective and help mitigate biases that might occur when hiring managers are pressured to fill positions quickly.”\n\nAmazon employees must be nominated by their manager, peers, or another bar raiser in order to be considered for the program. They can come from any part of the company, ranging in roles including product management, software development, human resources, and marketing. Aspiring bar raisers also have to complete an “extensive training” on Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles, which include “customer obsession, ownership, think big, and frugality.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBar raisers are charged with understanding the full picture of a candidate, Callahan said, and can help drive final hiring decisions. They’re “especially important during the evaluation stage” by driving the debrief discussion following an interview. A major part of their role is also to evaluate whether a candidate has the potential to grow in their role, Callahan said. Hence the name: The main purpose of a bar raiser is to keep the hiring bar high, she said.\n\n“One could speculate that Amazon brought [bar raisers] back based on data to continue and maintain this consistent, high-quality hiring standard and to reinforce the importance of cultural fit and long-term potential in their hiring decisions,” Bourgeois said.\n\nWhile Amazon declined to share with Fortune the types of questions a bar raiser might ask during an interview process, they’re in charge of evaluating the candidate’s core competencies for the job they’re applying for and whether they’ll meet the desired performance outcomes.\n\nBar raisers typically ask questions to assess a candidate’s long-term cultural fit and alignment with the company’s leadership principles, Bourgeois said, which can include detailing a time when they’ve had to make a difficult decision with limited information or how the candidate has “demonstrated customer obsession” in previous roles, she said. Candidates are also asked questions such as “Imagine you are leading a project and the timeline is cut in half. How would you adjust your approach to ensure success?” and “Describe a complex problem you have solved. What was your approach, and what were the results?”\n\nAmazon bar raisers also ask fellow interviewers questions during the debrief following an interview.\n\n“I've learned some key questions that get hiring managers to really think about the role and the decision,” Annie Groeninger, a former software development manager, told Amazon for an article about their bar-raiser program. “Some of my favorites to ask are, 'What does Amazon miss out on if we don't hire this person?' and 'What about this person makes you want to work with them?'\"\n\nGroeninger, who worked at Amazon for more than a decade, became a bar raiser after completing 800 interviews.\n\nAre these procedures common at other tech companies?\n\nWhile one might tend to believe software engineering interview questions and practices would be solely tech-focused, candidates are more frequently being asked and evaluated on behavioral questions.\n\n“Similar practices are becoming more common in tech companies, though they might go by different names. The tech industry is highly competitive, and companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft implement rigorous hiring processes to ensure they attract and retain top talent,” said Bourgeois, who now serves as an HR business partner for AmTrust Financial Services. “However, not all companies adopt this practice due to the resources and training required to implement and sustain this type of program effectively. Smaller companies or those in less competitive industries might not find it as feasible.”\n\nOne of the main benefits of Amazon’s bar-raiser program is balancing out a hiring team, Matt Collingwood, managing director of VIQU IT Recruitment, told Fortune.\n\n“The main benefit of a bar raiser is they can balance out a hiring team,” said Collingwood, who has more than 27 years of experience in IT recruiting. “When the hiring team [is] overly positive about a hire, a bar raiser could offer a more cautious or balanced view. This can contribute to a more stringent hiring process.”\n\nHowever, it’s important bar raisers are trained rigorously, but also have an understanding of the individual team’s culture and identity ahead of the interviewing process.\n\n“A drawback of a bar raiser is that they may not understand the team culture they are looking to hire into,” he said. “The individuals in that team will know what type of personality would fit best.”\n\nBut Amazon’s bar-raiser program is more about building a cohesive company culture—and not just a team.\n\n\"The role of a bar raiser is unique because we will not be involved in the day-to-day interaction with the interviewee, so we're completely focused on making hiring decisions for Amazon, not for a specific team or role,” Groeninger told Amazon. “Our ability [is] to maintain a long-term vision rather than focus on an immediate hiring need.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Analyzing stocks with raised price targets is a sure-shot approach to thrive in any market. Starting the investment path and identifying the appropriate standards for the industry you want to invest in may sometimes become tiresome. But when searching for stocks with raised price targets, you should start with the choices of seasoned behemoths like JPMorgan.\n\nThere are reputable companies that do financial research, such as Wells Fargo Securities (NYSE:WFC) and B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY). Still, only a few can compare to JPMorgan, which has $3.9 trillion in assets worldwide and can analyze and collect a lot of market data. Investors who care about the world value and follow the company’s direction.\n\nExamining equities with higher price targets is particularly crucial at this present time; JPMorgan believes that economic growth will slow down in 2024 and that real GDP growth will drop to around 0.7%. Though core inflation is forecast to stay over the Fed’s 2% target until 2024, inflation trends will probably continue falling. Less than the 3.4% increase seen in 2023, JPMorgan believes that core PCE values will climb by 2.4% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, it’s crucial to be alert and avoid ignoring JPMorgan when evaluating stocks with raised price targets.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is up over 63% this year, thanks to booming sales across its brands and regions. Reflecting this, JPMorgan changed its rating from “neutral” to “overweight” and boosted its price target for ANF from $167 to $194; the consensus price target is $175, translating into a potential upside of 24%.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch recently achieved its greatest first-quarter net sales ever increase and a gross profit margin of 66.4%, up 540 basis points from the previous year.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch will reopen in Pittsburgh and Buffalo. This marks the company’s return to these locations after its Buffalo store closed in 2021. ANF has over $1 billion yearly internet sales to complement its brick-and-mortar approach.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch is also working with McLaren F1. This relationship includes events, social media, and licensed graphic apparel. Abercrombie honored their partnership by exhibiting McLaren’s new Formula 1 car in their Fifth Avenue store and promoting a digital competition to win a racing weekend in Miami.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display.

New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify’s (NYSE:SPOT) first-quarter gross margins were excellent due to Music and Marketplace growth, as well as improved podcasts and commercials, according to JPMorgan. JPMorgan raised the price target for SPOT stock from $320 to $365, expecting more paying customers and higher pricing in key regions to boost earnings. Experts have rated Spotify a “strong buy.” With an average price target of $392.80, the stock has a possible upside of 24% despite a one-year return of over 128%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify will unveil a $5 HiFi add-on that lets users listen to FLAC music at 24-bit/44.1kHz without loss to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music, which provide free high-quality music.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek announced a “deluxe” level. Spotify’s subscription edition will include all the free versions’ features, higher sound quality, music management, AI-powered tracks, and more. Deluxe will likely cost $17 to $18 per month.\n\nSpotify and WPP (NYSE:WPP) also formed a groundbreaking worldwide partnership. This partnership will use Spotify’s audio analytics and WPP’s Choreograph technology to engage WPP clients’ consumers with distinctive and relevant audio ads.\n\nAdditionally, Spotify and Universal Music Group (OTCMKTS:UNVGY) are expanding their partnership. UMG will utilize Spotify’s tools and data to understand audience engagement better and improve fans’ music experiences under this deal.​​\n\nLendingTree (TREE) Lending Tree (TREE) website under magnifying glass\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) is rounding up our list of stocks with raised price targets from JPMorgan; the analyst firm upped its projection of TREE stock from $38 to $53 and reiterated its overweight rating. Maintaining an “outperform” rating, Oppenheimer also upped its price objective for LendingTree from $55 to $65, reflecting confidence in the company’s future performance and possible advantages from an insurance comeback and reduced interest rates.\n\nLending Tree’s modified EBITDA and income surpassed projections; sales fell in the higher range of forecasts. About 5% higher than previous projections, the business has revised its full-year sales prediction to fall between $690 million and $720 million.\n\nLendingTree’s first-quarter profits per share, at 70 cents, exceeded projections by 36 cents. Though down year over year, revenue of $167.8 million exceeded projections by $4.77 million. Again surpassing experts’ projections, the business forecasts sales for the second quarter between $175 million and $190 million, and TREE managed to better these estimates, reporting revenue of $210.1 million.\n\nAnalysts have assigned TREE a “strong buy” consensus: six buys, one hold, and zero sells. Reflecting a 17.86% upward from the latest price of $46.52, the stock has an average price target of $54.83.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in AAPL and AMZN.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, Inc. currently has a net worth of $185 billion, making him the second person on the list of world’s wealthiest individuals after Elon Musk. He founded the e-commerce giant in 1994, which at the time of writing, had a market capitalization of $1.699 trillion.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nThe professional journey of Bezos has demonstrated a deep understanding of effective leadership. Naturally, aspiring entrepreneurs and business leaders can glean valuable insights from his wisdom on several key subjects.\n\nOne such subject is the ability to achieve goals. The Amazon founder once said, “Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.”\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nThis statement underscores his belief in the power of a capable and innovative team. As Bezos built Amazon from a small online bookstore into a global e-commerce titan, several key individuals played crucial roles in the company's success.\n\nHere are three significant people who significantly contributed to Amazon's meteoric rise along with Bezos:\n\nMackenzie Scott\n\nBezos's former wife was instrumental in Amazon's early days. An accomplished writer and Princeton University graduate, Scott was one of the company's first employees (accountant).\n\nShe reportedly helped Bezos brainstorm a name for the company and managed the shipping of packages through UPS. Scott was also instrumental in creating Amazon's first business plan.\n\nTrending:This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nJeff Wilke\n\nHe joined Amazon in 1999 and was a driving force behind the company's operational efficiency. As the CEO of Worldwide Consumer, Wilke was responsible for streamlining Amazon's supply chain and logistics.\n\nBezos has previously called Wilke his mentor who built Amazon alongside him for 22 years. He was the likely successor to Bezos as CEO, however left the company in 2021 and the job instead went to Andy Jassy.\n\nTrending:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nAndy Jassy\n\nJassy succeeded Bezos as Amazon's CEO in 2021. Joining Amazon in 1997, Jassy helped build Amazon Web Services from the ground up, transforming it into a multi-billion-dollar cloud computing business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the current Amazon CEO has not been in the public eye like the e-commerce giant’s founder, Jassy was once called Bezos’ “shadow,” which entailed participating in all the meetings, including one-on-ones.\n\nDuring the 18 months Jassy spent shadowing Bezos, he reportedly identified several inefficiencies in how teams at Amazon worked together.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting in the Market Sell-Off: 2 Top Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Top investor Cathie Wood didn't let the global sell-off scare her away from the markets. As the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for their biggest declines in almost two years, the chief executive officer of Ark Invest loaded up on technology stocks -- some of the players that were the most heavily hit by this movement to sell.\n\nWood is known for betting on future winners early on, even scooping up shares of these players when everyone else is avoiding them. She favors innovation and companies that have a vision -- and the expertise to reach their goals over the long term.\n\nSpeaking of long term, that's another key part of Wood's strategy. She doesn't worry about declines in a particular stock today if the company's prospects are bright. That's because she plans on accompanying it through its growth story and benefiting over time.\n\nAs a result, Ark Invest completed more than 40 buys during the Aug. 5 sell-off and about 30 sells, according to the fund manager's daily trade report. Some of these transactions are for the same stock, being bought or sold for more than one fund. This shows that, during the sell-off, Cathie Wood was more of a buyer than a seller. Here are two top stocks she just bought. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nCathie Wood added shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to five of her funds, including the flagship Ark Innovation ETF. The stock dropped 13% over the past two sessions, leaving them trading for about 34 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 40x just a few weeks ago.\n\nHere's why this is a fantastic deal, and one the innovation-loving Wood couldn't pass up. Amazon already is a leader in two high-growth industries: e-commerce and cloud computing. This has generated billions of dollars in earnings, and the recent revamp of its cost structure should boost earning power in the quarters and years to come.\n\nOn top of this, the company has put a big focus on artificial intelligence (AI) in the early days of its high-growth story. It directly benefits from AI, with certain tools lowering its costs, for example. Even more importantly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells a wide range of AI products and services to its cloud customers, and this already has boosted growth.\n\n\"We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS,\" CEO Andy Jassy wrote in the recent letter to shareholders. AWS is supporting this idea, having already reached a $105 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to AI.\n\nAll of this makes Amazon a top bargain now with the potential over time as e-commerce, the cloud, and AI gather even more momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nWood added Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) to two of her funds after the top tech stock, which already was reasonably priced, got even cheaper. Meta shares slipped about 2.6% during the Aug. 5 session, and today they trade for 22 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 25 just a month ago.\n\nMeta is another stock that's on the path to winning in AI, and like Amazon, it has already built a successful and highly profitable business. You probably know Meta well if you use Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram, the company's social media apps. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of these apps every day.\n\nAdvertisers know this, so they flock to Meta to reach us, their target audience. This is how it generates the lion's share of its revenue, and the company has become so profitable that it even decided earlier this year to launch its first dividend.\n\nNow, Meta's focus on AI could lead us to spend even more time on the company's platforms, and that could lead advertisers to spend even more money there. Management aims to develop AI across its apps to help users with everything from leisure activities to business, and the company is well on its way. It's readying to train the fourth version of its large language model, Llama, which provides the knowledge that Meta's current and future AI applications need to operate.\n\nMeta is already delivering growth, but its investment in AI could generate a new era of growth down the road. And that's why now could be the perfect moment to follow star investor Wood into this top tech stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Markets tanked on Monday because the Japanese central bank raised its interest rate to 0.25%. Interest rates were originally at a benchmark between 0 and 0.1, meaning a minor 15- to 25-basis-point increase had significant consequences for investors who were making margin calls with Yen.\n\nInvestors raced to sell off their stock and repay their loans, causing markets to crash.  A weaker market allows investors to purchase stock at discounted prices. Indeed, the Healthcare sector is positioned to grow to $819 billion by 2027 at a robust 7% CAGR.

Concept of science, laboratory and study of diseases. Twist Biosciences (TWST)\n\nSource: dhvstockphoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwist BioScience (NASDAQ:TWST) is a biotechnology company that manufactures synthetic DNA products. Yahoo! Finance reports seven analysts predicting a 1-year price range on TWST between $31.11 and $65.00, with an average price target of $51.91.\n\nTWST reported financials that are characteristic of a biotechnology company. Q2 2024 revenue was strong, growing 27.81% YOY. However, the company has yet to return a profit this quarter, which has continued for the past year. There has been a trend of decreasing assets for the company, with total assets decreasing by 21.25% for Q2 2024. This marks the biggest decrease in the past year. However, the company’s improving liquidity offers hope to investors. A 464.11% increase in free cash flow for Q2 2024 demonstrates management handling operational expenses.\n\nThe company may have a reversal in the future from a partnership with bitBiome. Both companies partnered to create an enzyme screening kit with pharmaceutical applications. The enzyme (transaminase) within the kit is specialized in synthesizing active pharmaceutical ingredients while serving as an environmentally safe alternative to other methods. TWST recently joined the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (ASIC) to promote ethical AI development. Being environmentally and ethically conscious with upside potential makes TWST one of the healthcare AI stocks to buy.\n\nGE Healthcare (GEHC) GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign.

Yahoo! Finance reports 17 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on GEHC between $84.00 and $105.00, with an average price target of $93.95.\n\nStory continues\n\nGEHC has solid financials for Q2 2024. The company barely missed on revenue but beat EPS expectations for the quarter. Revenue grew 0.46% year over year, and net profit margin grew 1.84% year over year. Additionally, management has improved its handling of operational expenditures, with free cash flow growing 131.81% year over year.\n\nGEHC could be primed for a breakout with an AWS partnership. GEHC has partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to develop AI models for healthcare applications. Specifically, the partnership aims to aggregate data from doctor notes, x-rays and other medical tests to develop healthcare insights. For instance, compositing data in such a manner streamlines future similar processes by establishing precedents of solutions and treatments. The potential this AWS partnership carries, alongside strong financials, makes GEHC one of the Healthcare AI stocks to watch.\n\nClover Health (CLOV) Clover Health (CLOV) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nClover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is a healthcare company that provides Medicare Advantage insurance plans and operates as a direct contracting entity of the US government. Yahoo Finance! reports three analysts covering the stock with one buy rating and two hold ratings for July 2024.\n\nCLOV reported very strong financials for Q2 2024. While revenue grew by 7%, the net profit margin grew by 75.33%. Moreover, this quarter marks the first quarter of positive net income for the company. As a result of such good earnings, management has improved full-year guidance. The level of improvement is best seen through EBITDA projections. Originally, EBITDA guidance was between a $20 million loss and gain; now, it is between $50 and $65 million.\n\nThe company has developed Clover Assistant, an AI assistant SaaS. The assistant is meant to serve as a clinical decision-making tool for payers and providers based on the patient’s medical and financial data. Furthermore, the assistant tool allows CLOV to expand in areas that Medicare Advantage doesn’t reach. It also has the potential for one-on-one use with Medicare Advantage patients as a recurring revenue stream on a use-by-use basis. Developments with AI and an improving financial outlook make CLOV one of the healthcare stocks for investors to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) both posted their latest earnings reports on Aug. 1. Amazon's stock dipped after it missed analysts' revenue estimates and provided soft guidance for the current quarter, but Apple's stock held steady after it followed up its earnings beat with a stable near-term outlook.\n\nShould investors buy Apple and avoid Amazon? Let's take a fresh look at both companies' near-term challenges and valuations to find out. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWhy did Amazon's stock slump?\n\nAmazon's revenue rose 10% year over year to $148 billion in the second quarter of 2024 but missed analysts' expectations by $760 million. That revenue miss was caused by the slowing growth of its North American and international retail segments, which offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.\n\nGrowth by Segment (YOY) Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 North America revenue 11% 11% 13% 12% 9% International revenue 10% 16% 17% 10% 7% AWS revenue 12% 12% 13% 17% 19% Total revenue 11% 13% 14% 13% 10%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year.\n\nAmazon blamed its retail slowdown on tougher macro headwinds for consumer spending and lower average selling prices for bargain-hunting shoppers. It also said recent events -- including the U.S. presidential election, the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and the Paris Olympics -- were distracting shoppers and disrupting their online purchases.\n\nTougher competition from aggressive cross-border e-commerce competitors like Shein and PDD's Temu could be another major issue. All those challenges also throttled the growth of the company's integrated advertising services.\n\nOn the bright side, AWS' accelerating growth indicates the world's largest cloud platform continues to flourish -- even as it faces intense competition from Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. During the conference call, CEO Andy Jassy attributed a lot of that growth to the \"generative AI [artificial intelligence] boom,\" which is driving more companies to upgrade their cloud infrastructure services. AWS also has much higher operating margins than Amazon's e-commerce marketplaces, so it can still subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin businesses.\n\nAmazon expects its revenue to rise 8% to 11% year over year in the third quarter, but that midpoint missed analysts' estimates for 11% growth. For now, analysts expect the company's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 58%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy did Apple's stock hold steady?\n\nApple's revenue rose 5% year over year to $85.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29) and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.4 billion. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company generated 52% of its revenue from the iPhone, 24% of its revenue from services (including its App Store and subscription-based platforms), and the remaining 24% from its Macs, iPads, and wearables, home, and accessories segments.\n\nGrowth by Segment (YOY) Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 iPhone revenue (2%) 3% 6% (10%) (1%) Services revenue 8% 16% 11% 14% 14% Mac revenue (7%) (34%) 1% 4% 2% iPad revenue (20%) (10%) (25%) (17%) 24% Wearables, home, and accessories revenue 2% (3%) (11%) (10%) (2%) Total revenue (1%) (1%) 2% (4%) 5%\n\nData source: Apple. Fiscal year ends in September. YOY = Year over year.\n\nApple's services segment was the only business that consistently grew over the past year. But that closely watched segment, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers, faces unpredictable antitrust challenges in the U.S. and Europe as regulators probe its prioritization of first-party apps, developer restrictions, and high App Store fees.\n\nApple's iPhone sales slowed down as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. The company also faced tougher competition in China, and the strong dollar reduced overseas sales. But Mac sales -- which had experienced a growth spurt during the pandemic -- finally stabilized, as the company rolled out its new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Its iPad sales also finally rose again in the first quarter as the company launched the new iPad Air and iPad Pro.\n\nApple expects its growth to stabilize as it rolls out the iPhone 16 in September, ramps up expansion into India, and locks more users into its services ecosystem with a new batch of generative AI tools. It also continues to plow billions of dollars into its earnings-per-share (EPS) boosting buybacks. Analysts expect revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 16%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nThe valuations and verdict\n\nAmazon and Apple both face macro and competitive challenges, but the market seemed more disappointed by Amazon's slowing e-commerce sales than Apple's sluggish iPhone sales. Neither of these stocks is cheap right now. Amazon trades at 39 times forward earnings, while Apple has a slightly lower forward multiple of 30.\n\nI own both of these stocks, but I'm not in a hurry to add more shares or trim my existing positions.

        "title": "Amazon Prime Video plots Hollywood expansion",
        "content": "By Dawn Chmielewski and Greg Bensinger\n\n(Reuters) - When Mike Hopkins was approached about leading Amazon Prime Video, his view of the streaming service matched one held widely in Hollywood -- it was nothing more than a perk for subscribers of the online retailer’s two-day delivery service.\n\nBut Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had much bigger ambitions for the service that offers movies, television shows and original programming.\n\n“After meeting with Jeff, it was very clear that he really saw this as an opportunity to build a media company,” said Hopkins, an entertainment industry veteran of Fox Networks, Sony Pictures and Hulu who has in the last four years plotted Prime Video’s path to mainstream Hollywood player.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder Hopkins, Prime Video is being recast in the mold of a traditional media company, with its own film studio and theatrical distribution arm, a growing slate of original movies and series featuring A-list actors, an expanding roster of professional sports and advertising.\n\n\"We ... like the progress of Prime Video,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told investors this month.\n\nPrime Video’s gathering star power-- and live sports -- position it to capture a greater share of the $28.75 billion in digital advertising revenue Emarketer projects will be spent this year on streaming, as marketers trim their investment in traditional television. Morgan Stanley estimates Prime Video ads could generate $3.3 billion in sales this year and more than double to $7.1 billion within two years.\n\nEven so, Prime Video continued to lag industry leaders YouTube and Netflix by share of streaming television viewing in the U.S. for the month of June, as measured by Nielsen. And, while more of its shows have broken into Nielsen’s Top 10 ranking of the most-streamed original series in 2023, Netflix remains dominant.\n\nSPORTS, STARS AND ADS\n\nStill, Amazon’s aspirations to create a single entertainment destination that offers something for every taste are coming into clearer focus, say nine agents, ad buyers and entertainment industry executives.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime Video became the first streaming service to land an exclusive deal with the NBA, creating year-round sports programming that, by 2025, will include the NFL football, NASCAR car racing, the WNBA Finals and Champions League soccer.\n\nAnd in a threat to traditional studios, Amazon plans to more than double the number of theatrical releases from six this year to as many as 16 by 2027, Reuters can report for the first time. That number does not include movies made for non-U.S. audiences, the five or six it typically acquires from other studios, and the dozen or so movies it plans to distribute directly on Prime Video. That output would rival that of Hollywood's most prolific studio, Universal Pictures.\n\nPrime Video increased its outlay by $1.7 billion to $13.6 billion this year as it deepens its investment in professional sports and increases the volume of content production, market researcher Ampere Analysis estimates, while other studios tighten spending on content.\n\nAmazon’s talent roster increasingly features Hollywood’s A-list, like Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhaal and Octavia Spencer, alongside sports standouts such as tennis great Roger Federer. It even struck a deal with Netflix’s former film chief, Scott Stuber, to revive the storied United Artists label at Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nPrime Video now understands “they need premium content and celebrities in order to attract advertisers,” said Jessica Brown, managing director of digital investment for media buyer GroupM. “Before, they had the reach and scale, but they didn’t have the content story.\"\n\n\"You need to be culturally relevant,” she said.\n\nMadison Avenue took notice when Prime Video this January began showing ads to its roughly 115 million U.S. viewers, instantly becoming the largest ad-supported subscription streaming service, domestically, according to Emarketer.\n\nAdvertising executives said that reach and the purchasing insights gleaned from Amazon’s online retail store offer a distinct opportunity. Notably, Amazon can offer to instantly sell consumers goods they see during commercial breaks.\n\n“That is reverberating through the marketplace right now,” said Kevin Krim, CEO of marketing analytics firm EDO, adding that the flood of new inventory may also be driving down advertising prices for others.\n\nENTERTAIN EVERYONE\n\nAmazon has at times struggled creatively. Despite hits like “The Boys” – about vigilantes who seek to expose corrupt superheroes, which hit No. 1 in more than 165 countries when the fourth season debuted – it also produced expensive misses like “Citadel,” a thriller with tepid reviews that failed to make Nielsen’s streaming rankings in the U.S.\n\nA creative team is courting more broadly-appealing fare with global reach, said Hopkins. The ideal Prime Video project has been described by talent agents as the equivalent of an airport novel, a story that’s page-turning and commercial. It’s Amazon’s answer to Netflix’s programming philosophy of offering a “gourmet cheeseburger,” or well-executed entertainment that’s also widely popular.\n\n“We want to be lots of people’s No.1 show or film,” said Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.\n\nAmazon is focused on four different audience segments -- including men and women over age 35, and those under 35 -- that it can serve with a reliable stream of content that's budgeted in a way that reflects the size of the potential audience, said Hopkins. Projects with broad appeal would have larger budgets than those targeted at a narrow demographic, he said.\n\nAgents say Amazon is on the hunt for young adult fare like \"The Summer I Turned Pretty,\" a teen romance, action-thriller series in the vein of \"Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,\" which appeal men over age 35, and female-skewing stories like \"The Idea of You,\" about a love affair between a single mother and the lead singer of a boy band, which attracted nearly 50 million viewers worldwide in its first two weeks.\n\n\"We don't want to have a 'Saltburn' and then nothing else for that audience for six months,\" Hopkins said in an interview, referring to the popular Amazon MGM psychological thriller about an Oxford student’s entanglement with a classmate’s eccentric family.\n\nAmazon continues to place calculated big bets. The $150 million it spent to adapt video game “Fallout” as a critically acclaimed series became Prime Video’s second most watched series.\n\nInstantly recognizable characters and stories are critical, because Amazon tends to attract viewers seeking specific shows, according to one agent who requested anonymity to preserve his relationship with the company. \"People aren’t just trolling around on Amazon like they do on Netflix,\" he said.\n\nIt’s a far cry from Amazon’s early foray into video streaming, when it attempted to crowdsource content from customers.\n\nThe transition accelerated with Amazon’s $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM, the studio behind the James Bond and \"Legally Blonde\" franchises. That deal gave Amazon a trove of intellectual property which it could mine, without engaging in costly bidding wars for sought-after projects, said Hopkins.\n\nHe said Amazon wanted to avoid an \"arms race.\"\n\n\"We decided it would be better for us, in the long run, to own a studio that had really good IP, and then develop our own things,\" said Hopkins.\n\nSports are another critical pillar of Hopkins's media strategy.\n\nThe final element of Hopkins’ plan is to recreate \"Prime without the shipping.\" Amazon has amassed a deep library of content, spanning free, ad-supported TV-like channels, rival streaming services like Paramount+, recently released movies to rent or buy, all accessible via Prime Video's newly redesigned app.\n\n\"What we're really trying to build is not just a single subscription service -- I think we've proven that we can play a much broader game,\" said Hopkins, adding that as CEO Jassy has said, \"We're on track to be a meaningfully profitable business in our own right.”\n\n(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Editing by Anna Driver)",

        "title": "Stock Market Sell-Off: 2 Top Stocks I Plan to Buy if the Market Keeps Melting Down",
        "content": "Stock market sell-offs can be scary events. They seem to come out of nowhere, and their end is seemingly nowhere in sight. That uncertainty can be unnerving.\n\nWhile sell-offs can be challenging, they also often present unique opportunities to buy high-quality companies at much lower prices. That's why I always hold a decent amount of cash in my portfolio to capitalize on unexpected downdrafts. I also put together a watch list of stocks I'd like to buy during a meaningful market decline. Topping my current list areAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and WM (NYSE: WM). Here's why I want to buy more of them and the price I'd jump on if the opportunity arises during the current market meltdown.\n\nHolding out for an even better sale price\n\nShares of Amazon have cratered about 20% from their recent peak.That plunge comes even though the e-commerce and cloudgiantis thriving.\n\nThe company recently reported its second-quarter results. Net sales surged 10%, partly driven by a 19% sales increase from Amazon Web Services. Meanwhile, its net income more than doubled to $13.5 billion.\n\nAmazon has also become a cash-flow machine over the past year. Its operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months has rocketed 75% to $108 billion compared to the prior-year period. Meanwhile, it has generated a whopping $53 billion in free cash flow over the last year compared to $7.9 billion in the year-ago period. After years of heavy investments, Amazon is finally turning into the cash-flow machine many have long expected it to become.\n\nThe company's robust growth should continue. It's investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is also benefiting its cloud business. It also continues to expand its offerings to e-commerce and Prime customers.\n\nWhile I think the roughly 20% haircut in Amazon stock is already a decent pullback, I plan to wait to see if it falls farther before adding to my position. I'd pounce on the opportunity to buy more shares below $150.\n\nTurning trash into treasure\n\nWM stock has fallen about 10% from its recent peak. That sell-off has come even though the leading waste management company is having another solid year. The company's revenue rose 5.5% in the second quarter, while its underlying earnings jumped 10.3% due to continuing margin expansion (its margin hit 30% for the first time ever).\n\nThe company has also made excellent progress on its strategic expansion plan. It spent over $750 million in the first half of the year growing its solid waste collection business via a string of strategic acquisitions, adding several new geographies while also expanding in some of its growth markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nWM also continues to expand into adjacent areas to its core business to drive more growth. It recently opened two upgraded recycling facilities and is building several renewable natural gas projects. Meanwhile, it agreed to acquire leading medical waste services provider Stericycle for $7.2 billion, which should be an accretive deal for shareholders.\n\nThe company's growing cash flow will give it more money to return to shareholders. While WM plans to pause share repurchases over the next 18 months while it repays debt related to the Stericycle deal, it should continue increasing its dividend.\n\nWM operates such a stable business that it rarely goes on sale. Because of that, the recent 10% discount in its share price looks like a compelling long-term buying opportunity. However, I'd like to see an even bigger discount before I buy more shares, with my target to buy them if they fall below $185.\n\nWaiting to see if the sell-off accelerates\n\nSell-offs aren't fun. However, they can be opportunities to buy great companies at better prices. That's why I've started making a watch list of stocks I'd love to buy more of if they keep falling. Amazon and WM top my list. While I think their recent declines already make them more enticing, I'm going to be patient to see if I can nab an even lower price for these high-quality stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Results Were ‘Imperfect’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you “cry yourself to sleep.” Cramer said that this “nasty” selloff was expected.\n\n“It’s exactly what you’d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was “vicious enough” to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that’s exactly “what you have to do.” He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their “pants down” when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it’s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet “until we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.”\n\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn’t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he’d do it.\n\n“He’s got horse sense,” Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said there are no “safe havens” in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for “pain” in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\n“If you can’t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer is Talking About Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amid Global Selloff?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) results were “imperfect.” Sales of Amazon were “light” but AWS showed strengths. Cramer thinks Amazon’s revenue guidance was weak but the company has a history of guiding conservatively.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Amazon has got to keep on spending on computing to keep up with Alphabet and more importantly Meta and Microsoft,” Cramer said.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company’s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\n\nAWS’s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\n\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\n\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\n\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers’ investments in generative AI projects continue growing.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Nasdaq Market Correction: 1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Now, and Another to Avoid",
        "content": "Recession fears resurfaced last week when a disappointing jobs report raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates. That knocked the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) into correction territory, meaning the technology-heavy index has fallen at least 10% from its record high.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have suffered double-digit declines, though some have been hit harder than others. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) plunged 20% from its high, while Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has slipped just 11%. Investors may be tempted to buy the dip in both cases, but not every pullback is a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon shares currently trade at a reasonable valuation, but Apple shares still look expensive. Here are the important details.\n\nAmazon: The Magnificent Seven stock worth buying right now\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three large markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace, as measured by monthly visitors. It is the third-largest advertising company in the U.S., and eMarketer says Amazon could take second place from Meta Platforms by the end of the decade. Finally, Amazon Web Services is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, meaning it's ideally positioned to monetize artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, missing the $148.6 billion forecasted by Wall Street. But generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income surged 94% to $1.26 per share, topping the $1.03 per share analysts anticipated.\n\nUnfortunately, management also issued somewhat disappointing guidance. The company expects operating income to increase 18% in the third quarter, while analysts expected 37% growth. That shortfall contributed to the recent drawdown in the stock, but it creates an opportunity for patient investors.\n\nAmazon still has strong growth prospects in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Retail e-commerce sales and digital ad spending are expected to grow at annual rates of 8% and 10%, respectively, through 2027, according to eMarketer. Meanwhile, public cloud services revenue is forecasted to compound at 19% annually through 2028, according to IDC. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth in the coming years, which should translate into slightly faster earnings growth as the company continues to optimize operating costs.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase at 23% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 38.5 times earnings look reasonable. I say that because those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.7, a material discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Patient investors should feel confident buying a small position in Amazon today.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: The Magnificent Seven stock best avoided right now\n\nApple breaks its business into two revenue streams: products and services. The former includes revenue from consumer electronic devices like the iPhone, iPads, and Mac computers, while the latter includes revenue from the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud, and subscriptions offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. The company has a strong presence in several of those markets.\n\nApple consistently ranks second and fourth in quarterly smartphone and personal computer (PC) shipments, respectively. It operates the leading mobile app store, as measured by sales, and it has parlayed that leadership into a booming advertising business.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Pay is the leading in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers, and Apple TV+ recently overtook Paramount Global's Paramount+ as the sixth-most-popular streaming service in the U.S.\n\nYet, Apple is also beset by headwinds. The recently enacted Digital Markets Act could damage the dominance of its App Store in Europe by forcing the company to support third-party app stores. Additionally, Apple is losing smartphone market share to local competitors in China. Regional iPhone shipments fell 3% in the second quarter despite an acceleration in the broader market. That is concerning because China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue last year.\n\nFinally, Apple lacks a clear-cut strategy where AI is concerned. It plans to introduce Apple Intelligence in October, bringing AI features to iPhones and MacBooks. But those features are free and, apart from potentially driving product upgrades, management has yet to detail plans for future monetization. Bloomberg has speculated that Apple will eventually charge for certain AI features, but whether consumers will pay is another question.\n\nApple reported modest financial results in the June quarter. Revenue rose 4.8% to $85.8 billion, and GAAP net income increased 7.6% to $21.4 billion. Active devices hit a record high across all products and geographic segments, services revenue climbed 14% to a record $24.2 billion, and gross margin expanded 180 basis points. In short, Apple is successfully drawing consumers to its hardware ecosystem and monetizing them with high-margin services.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Apple stock currently trades at 31.8 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 27.8 times earnings. That price tag looks especially expensive, given that Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 9% annually over the next three years.\n\nThat rich valuation may explain why Warren Buffett has slashed Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple in recent quarters.

        "content": "Markets stabilized today with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rising 1% after a correction like selloff over the last week. As volatility fears start to settle Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT are two big tech stocks investors may be eyeing for a rebound.\n\nDespite giving back much of their lofty gains this year, Amazon and Microsoft’s stock are still up just over +7% in 2024 with both companies recently exceeding their quarterly earnings expectations. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCloud Comparison\n\nAlthough they have different business models, Amazon and Microsoft compete as cloud providers. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud provider followed by Microsoft’s Azure cloud.\n\nReporting its Q2 results last Thursday, Amazon’s AWS segment sales spiked 18% to $26.28 billion while exceeding estimates of $25.86 billion by 1%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter last Tuesday with Azure helping the software titan bring in $28.51 billion for its Intelligent Cloud segment. This was a 19% leap from the comparative quarter but slightly missed estimates of $28.66 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth & Outlook\n\nAmazon’s total sales are now expected to rise 10% in fiscal 2024 and are projected to increase another 11% in FY25 to $704.04 billion. On the bottom line, the e-commerce behemoth's annual earnings are slated to soar 62% this year to $4.70 per share versus EPS of $2.90 in 2023. Even better, FY25 EPS is expected to leap another 24% to $5.84. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPivoting to Microsoft, total sales are projected to be up 13% in its current fiscal 2025 and are forecasted to jump another 13% in FY26 to $314.8 billion. Furthermore, Microsoft’s EPS is expected to rise 10% in FY25 and is slated to expand another 15% in FY26 to $15.04. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nValuation Comparison\n\nAfter their recent pullbacks Amazon’s stock trades at 34.8X forward earnings with Microsoft at 30.3X. Trading at modest premiums to the S&P 500’s 21.8X forward earnings multiple, Amazon’s stock is at a nice discount to its five-year median of 71.8X with Microsoft slightly beneath its own median of 32X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the moment, Amazon and Microsoft’s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Recent market volatility does suggest there could be better buying opportunities for these tech leaders but their growth and more attractive valuations make them sound long-term investments especially when the smoke finaly clears.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Dow Jones is one of the oldest benchmarks in investing. Introduced in 1896, the index remains a popular benchmark for measuring the economy. There’s certainly more to measuring the economy than a single benchmark, but investors have used it as a gauge for many years.\n\nThe index has undergone many changes since its introduction in 1896. It originally consisted of 12 companies and was expanded to 30 companies in 1928. Some of the 1928 Dow Jones companies are still in business, while others are corporate giants of the past.\n\nA closer look at the current Dow Jones holdings can reveal several opportunities to increase your return. That makes sense. The index has gained roughly 50% over the past five years, and it can’t achieve those gains with a bad portfolio. However, some Dow stocks are better than others. These are some of the best Dow stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPeople continue to buy goods and services regardless of the economy. Many people turn to credit and debit cards to make those purchases, much to the benefit of American Express (NYSE:AXP). The credit and debit card firm has delivered a 23% year-to-date gain and has surged by more than 85% over the past five years. The stock has a 17 P/E ratio and offers a 1.21% yield.\n\nThe firm has a good history of dividend hikes. It has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years, including a 17% dividend hike this year.\n\nThe company continues to deliver strong financial results, including 9% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter. Net income jumped 39% year over year (YOY) in the same quarter, resulting in a 20% net profit margin. American Express has a more reasonable valuation than credit and debit card competitors. Wall Street believes the stock can gain an additional 8% from current levels.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading big tech stock that significantly influences the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. The company is also deeply integrated into many people’s lives. Many people use Amazon’s online marketplace to buy products and services. They can also turn to Whole Foods to buy groceries. Amazon Web Services powers many businesses, and people frequently use Amazon Prime Video for entertainment.\n\nThe tech giant delivered 10% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter. The results were decent but not as good as expected. Amazon Web Services was a bright spot, delivering 19% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon’s advertising segment delivered 20% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon looks like it will deal with some short-term headwinds. However, its leading presence in multiple verticals makes it a compelling long-term stock. Amazon is still rated as a Strong Buy and has a projected 34% upside from current levels.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has stood out this year with a 29% year-to-date gain. The global retailer and the world’s leading grocer continues to generate revenue and net income growth. Q1 FY25 revenue increased by 6.0% year, while adjusted EPS went up by 22.4%.\n\nThe company continues to gain market share in the e-commerce industry. Online sales were up 21%, and store-fulfilled picks and deliveries contributed to the elevated e-commerce sales.\n\nThat’s not the only catalyst driving the rise in Walmart shares. The retailer’s global advertising business grew 24%, including a 26% increase in Walmart Connect’s U.S. revenue. Rising ad revenue is a great development for Walmart since advertising comes with higher profit margins.\n\nElevated earnings can help Walmart return to being a dividend-growth stock. The company made strides in this area earlier this year by announcing a 9% dividend hike. That’s Walmart’s highest dividend increase in more than a decade, and it marks Walmart’s 51st consecutive year of dividend hikes.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "title": "Fox CEO: Venu Sports price of $42.99 'hits the right mark'",
        "content": "Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming partnership among Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), recently announced its price point of $42.99 a month.\n\nWall Street analysts have debated whether consumers would fork over a relatively high monthly fee for another standalone service. Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said Tuesday the price point is exactly where the company wants it to be.\n\n\"We think that really hits the right mark and the target for where we want to be as a business, but also as a consumer proposition,\" he said during the company's fiscal fourth quarter earnings call.\n\nThat monthly price point is on the low end of what Wall Street had been expecting. Morgan Stanley had pointed to potential pricing between $40 and $50 a month.\n\nThe three companies first announced the joint venture (JV) in February and teased a debut sometime this fall. The service will bring together their respective slates of sports rights and comes as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability.\n\nOn Tuesday, Murdoch reiterated previous guidance, saying he expects subscribers to hit around 5 million by 2029 and that the opportunity lies in capturing the \"cord cutters\" and the \"cord nevers.\"\n\n\"All of the partners in Venu feel very strongly that we can target our marketing and our subscriber acquisition to sports fans that are not currently in the cable television bundle,\" he said. \"That's important to us and that really is what leads us to a subscriber level in the single-digit millions.\"\n\nIn terms of financials, Fox CFO Steve Tomsic said the business will take \"some time\" before its cash flows hit break even but that the benefit will come through in revenue from affiliate fees, or the fees pay-TV providers pay to network owners to carry their channels, as Fox will serve as \"a key supplier to the JV.\"\n\n\"On a net-net basis, it should be accretive to us on a pretty quick basis,\" he said.\n\nFox reported fourth quarter affiliate revenue that came in above consensus estimates and grew 5% year over year, with 2% growth in cable and 9% growth in TV. The company said it expects \"to modestly grow\" its affiliate fees in 2025 despite declining subscribers.

(Ric Tapia/Getty Images) (Ric Tapia via Getty Images)\n\nA few risks have circled the sports platform ahead of its launch.\n\nOne includes possible antitrust regulation after sports streamer FuboTV (FUBO) filed a lawsuit against the media giants behind the JV, citing \"the extreme suppression of competition in the US sports-focused streaming market.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe companies have specifically warned about antitrust hurdles, saying in a prior news release, \"The formation and launch of the new service is subject to regulatory approval and the finalization of definitive agreements amongst the parties.\"\n\nAnother overhang includes the loss of NBA rights for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has since sued the league over its \"unjustified rejection\" of WBD's matching rights proposal.\n\nLast month, the NBA officially approved a media rights package that excluded WBD, one of the league's current partners, in favor of two newcomers: tech giant Amazon (AMZN) and Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). It was able to strike a new agreement with its other current media partner, Disney.\n\nWall Street analysts have warned that the loss of the rights could impact the viability of the soon-to-launch platform.\n\n\"Without NBA rights, WBD will become a weak third leg on the sports JV tricycle, and it won’t have the leverage to sustain or grow its retransmission fees,\" eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes previously told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Global Market Crash Sparks Reflection On Jeff Bezos' 2000 Dotcom Comments After Amazon's 80% Plunge: 'We're A Company That Wants To Be Weighed, And Over Time We Will Be'",
        "content": "Global Market Crash Sparks Reflection On Jeff Bezos' 2000 Dotcom Comments After Amazon's 80% Plunge: 'We're A Company That Wants To Be Weighed, And Over Time We Will Be'\n\nGlobal equity markets, commodities, and cryptocurrencies all crashed on Black Monday 2.0, and investors are worried about the unabated sell-off. Against this backdrop, social media tapped into sagacious comments from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the aftermath of the 2000 dotcom bubble burst to draw some encouragement.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWhat Happened: When Amazon shares were annihilated along with the other tech stocks in 2000, Bezos strived to calm the agitated shareholders through his letter to them. Excerpts of the letter that Bloomberg journalist JonErlichman shared showed the billionaire reeling off Amazon’s achievements in fiscal year 2000. “Our shares are down more than 80% from when I wrote you last year. Nevertheless, by almost any measure, Amazon.com the company is in a stronger position now than at any time in its past,” he said.\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nTo substantiate his claim, he noted that Amazon’s customer count increased from 14 million to 20 million between 1999 and 2000, sales climbed from over 68% to $2.76 billion, pro forma operating loss narrowed by 6% and average spend per customer rose 19%, among other things.\n\nBezos tapped into the wisdom of Benjamin Graham, who is widely called the father of value investing. The Amazon founder quoting Graham said the stock market is like a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term,\n\n“Clearly there was a lot of voting going on in the boom year of '99—and much less weighing,” Bezos said.\n\nTrending:These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\n“We're a company that wants to be weighed, and over time, we will be—over the long term, all companies are. In the meantime, we have our heads down working to build heavier and heavier company,” he added.\n\nWhy It’s Important: On Monday, Amazon shares fell a little over 4%, less than what most of its mega-cap tech peers lost. Bezos is not part of the active management team of Amazon now and serves as chairman of the board, and the e-commerce giant is led by his successor Andy Jassy.\n\nSee Also: Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nTrue to what Bezos said, Amazon has now grown as a heavier company. The second-quarter results released last week showed the top line growing to $147.98 billion and earnings coming in at $1.26 per share. Apart from the core e-commerce business, the company has diversified its operations to include a thriving cloud computing business called AWS, giving it exposure to the hot-and-happening artificial intelligence technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom the post-dotcom bubble burst bottom of a split-adjusted 30 cents per share (split-adjusted price), the stock has risen to $161.02, a gain of about 54,000%.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, ended Monday’s session down 2.91% at $517.38, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.

        "title": "Skip Amazon and Buy These 3 E-Commerce Stocks Instead- August 2024",
        "content": "Whenever we talk about e-commerce, the first name that comes to mind is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is natural to think of the largest e-commerce company and one that delivers everything in the shortest span. While Amazon is one of the best e-commerce businesses out there, its valuation is soaring and the company is building a diversified business where it generates revenue from areas other than e-commerce. I’ve identified three e-commerce stocks that could perform better than Amazon and generate significant returns in the long term.\n\nNow is the time to cash in on the e-commerce hype and look for stocks that can become the next Amazon. These companies have set themselves apart in the industry by offering something that Amazon doesn’t and they have carved a niche for themselves. The future of e-commerce is bright and here are three stocks that can help you make the most of it.\n\nE-commerce Stocks to Buy: Shopify (SHOP) Let Shopify Stock Finish Cooling off Before You Invest\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe e-commerce giant Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is one of the best stocks you can bet on. Since its IPO in 2015, the stock has soared more than 1000% and has shown tremendous strength amidst market volatility.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company offers a platform for merchants to sell their products while it allows consumers to make quick and convenient purchases. It also allows developers to build more features and retain 100% of their revenue up to a maximum of $1 million.\n\nThese reasons have made Shopify a top choice for customers, merchants, and developers. The self-service tools make it convenient for all three parties to use the platform and there is significant demand for its services. As merchants shift away from the large marketplace of Amazon, Shopify will be the next best choice.\n\nThe world is moving towards e-commerce and Shopify has ample opportunities to expand. It reported an impressive first quarter and beat expectations. Its revenue came in at $1.86 billion and the EPS stood at $0.20.\n\nThe gross payments volume jumped 60% year-over-year to $36.2 billion while the gross merchandise volume increased 23% YOY to $60.9 billion. The growth in merchandise value shows that the company is moving in the right direction.  Shopify is set to report results this week and it could beat expectations.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the tough economic environment, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is standing tall. A legacy business, Walmart is known for its chain of supermarkets across the United States. The company has established itself in such a manner that it becomes convenient for consumers to walk into a Walmart nearby.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith fulfillment centers spread across the country, Walmart continues to attract customers through low-priced products. However, keeping the changing trends and preferences in mind, the company has invested in the e-commerce business which has become a growth driver today.\n\nIn the first quarter, online sales soared 21% YOY and the total revenue reached $161 billion. Despite competition, there is room for Walmart to expand and it is leaving no stone unturned to win the e-commerce segment.\n\nIt has also introduced advertisements on the platform which allow third-party sellers to advertise their products. The ad segment revenue grew 24% in the quarter. What I like about Walmart is that the company is not only growing revenue but also seeing higher profits.\n\nUp 27% YTD, Walmart stock is trading for $67 and is on a rally. Walmart is also a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 1.23%. I believe Walmart can keep innovating and moving ahead even in testing times. While low consumer spending can hurt the business, the long-term picture looks attractive. Buying Walmart below $100 is a smart move and this investment could pay off in the next few years.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leader in the e-commerce space, MercadoLibre (NYSE:MELI) holds a strong position in Latin America. The company enjoys an edge in the industry due to the lack of competition and manages to address a large market. It controls more than one-fifth of the total e-commerce sales in Latin America and this has helped it report impressive financials, leading the stock to soar higher. It is the finest combination of an e-commerce and fintech business.\n\nUp 16% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $1,776 as of writing and is up over 150% in the past five years. In the second quarter, the company reported a 20% YOY jump in gross merchandise volume.\n\nBesides e-commerce, the company sells debit cards, prepaid cards, digital payment solutions, and point-of-sale devices in addition to investment and savings products through its fintech segment Mercado Pago.\n\nMonthly active users on the fintech platform jumped 20%, and revenue soared 42% to $5.1 billion. After that, net income soared 103% YOY. With a presence across multiple countries, MercadoLibre is set to benefit as we transition towards digitization.\n\nIt generates impressive cash flow and the complete spectrum of online and offline fintech services has made it an industry leader. MercadoLibre is the Amazon of Latin America and it is here to stay. Considering its current footprint, the company can enjoy a wider market despite growing competition.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street sees ‘buying opportunity’ amid AI pullback",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks, a hallmark of the recent bull market run, have lost steam over the past month.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) are all down more than 15% over the period amid a broader market sell-off that's seen the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) decline more than 10% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 8%. Even as investors have begun to question recent earnings results from the group, some strategists don't think this is the end of the AI run.\n\n\"We keep our overweight to U.S. equities, driven by the AI mega force, and see the selloff presenting buying opportunities,\" BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a research note Monday night.\n\nRecession fears have driven the market lower as investors speculate over whether the Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy too restrictive. BlackRock describes these concerns as \"overdone.\"\n\n\"We think growth will be supportive of risk assets and believe markets are pricing in too many Fed rate cuts,\" the team wrote.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who holds the most bullish year-end S&P 500 target on Wall Street at 6,000, isn't backing down either. In a note to clients on Monday, Emanuel noted that the recent spike in the CBOE Volatility Index(^VIX), provides the opportunity for \"patient buying.\" Quick spikes in volatility, as seen on Monday, usually end with stocks higher a year later, per Emanuel.\n\nHe likens the current moment to the large drawdowns seen in tech stocks during the \"1994-99 Boom bull market.\"\n\n\"The rationale for AI, in a world where the global workforce is aging rapidly and efficiency will be critical to drive productivity enhancements, is greater than ever,\" Emanuel wrote. \"We view the current 'AI Air Pocket' as an opportunity to gain exposure to a long term secular theme.\"\n\nStill, if investors have been staying out of the large tech names because valuations have risen to an uncomfortable level, whether the recent drawdown has done enough to create an attractive buying opportunity is up for debate.\n\nThe equity research team at Goldman Sachs points out that while the basket of large tech stocks, including — Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta (META), Microsoft and Nvidia — is down 13% since July 10, earnings estimates have been moving higher. Since June 30, 2025 earnings estimates for all of those companies except Microsoft have risen.\n\nThis has brought a contraction of valuation multiples for the group of tech stocks, but they still trade slightly higher than the 10-year median average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The mega-cap tech stocks have dropped sharply, but their valuations continue to reflect AI optimism despite investor concerns about the likely timing,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Monday night.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "When there's a market deluge, Cathie Wood is there trying to catch the drops in a bucket. The co-founder, CEO, and stock picker at Ark Invest had one of her busiest days of trading on Monday, when the market was plummeting. She added to two dozen of her existing positions, taking advantage of the lower entry points. Will her strategy work?\n\nWood kicked off the new trading week by building up her stakes in Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla Motors(NASDAQ: TSLA), and Tempus (NASDAQ: TEM). The shares fell 2% to 4% on Monday as part of the larger market sell-off. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe leading online retailer's 4% decline on Monday wasn't pleasant for shareholders, but the past few weeks haven't been a pleasure cruise, either. Amazon has now fallen 20% since hitting an all-time high last month.\n\nThe larger drop came on Friday of last week. Amazon stock fell 9% after the company posted poorly received financial results. Earnings per share nearly doubled to $1.26 in the second quarter, well ahead of the $1.03 analysts were targeting. There wasn't a lot of surprise behind the surprise, as Amazon has topped Wall Street profit targets by a double-digit percentage in each of the past four quarters. Unfortunately for Amazon, that was pretty much the only good news in last week's update.\n\nRevenue rose 10% to $148 billion for the three months ending in June, just shy of analyst expectations. A 19% jump in its buoyant Amazon Web Services segment was weighed down by a 9% increase in North American e-commerce sales and a 7% gain for its smaller international business. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon's outlook is also a sore spot for the market. It sees net sales rising 8% to 11% in the the third quarter. The midpoint is below the nearly 11% year-over-year jump Wall Street pros were targeting. Amazon also sees its operating income growth slowing substantially from previous quarters.\n\nThe stock is intriguing here. Revenue growth is slowing. This is shaping up to be the third consecutive year of top-line growth of less than 12%, the three worst years of its 27-year trading history. Amazon is feeling pretty mortal now. It's facing Chinese e-commerce players that are growing quickly, and brick-and-mortar chains are getting smarter about drumming up digital sales. A potential recession won't help, either.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, bottom-line forecasts keep inching higher. Amazon's shrinking price finds it trading at 34 times this year's projected earnings and less than 28 times next year's estimate. These are rich multiples for an e-commerce company growing net sales at a much slower and slowing pace. However, Amazon deserves a rich market multiple given its dominant market position and its high-margin AWS business.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Tesla Motors\n\nTesla is the largest holding of Wood's largest fund, accounting for 14% of the assets of the Ark Innovation ETF(NYSEMKT: ARKK). With Tesla shares down 20% so far this year, they're playing a role in why Ark Innovation is losing to the market for the third time in the past four years.\n\nThere are growth challenges for Tesla right now. Revenue rose just 2% in its latest quarter, and that was with its energy generation and storage business doubling over the past year. Its flagship auto segment saw its sales dip 7%. A 5% decline in vehicle deliveries and lower average selling prices resulted in a much bigger hit on overall profitability.\n\nTesla remains the leader in its niche. Some of the more aggressive growth models may need to be pared back, particularly those that assumed the prices for Tesla vehicles and premium offerings like its full-self driving platform have moved lower, not higher, over the past year. Is Tesla a richly valued automaker or a bargain tech company? Wood would agree with the latter, and it's why she was a buyer on Monday.\n\n3. Tempus AI\n\nSome IPOs are more volatile than others, and Tempus AI has been a bucking bronco since going public in mid-June. The stock has traded as low as $22.89 a week after its market debut.

        "content": "Market News\n\nWall Street closed lower on Monday, dragged down by technology stocks and a significant drop in U.S. oil prices. The Dow and S&P 500 experienced their biggest losses since September 2022, and the Nasdaq also closed lower amid worries about an economic downturn.\n\nHow Did The Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 2.6% or 1,033.99 points to close at 38,703.27. All components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory. This decline marks the Dow and the S&P 500's largest single-day losses since September 2022.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 160.23 points, or 3%, to close at 5,186.33. All 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC), and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 3.3%, 2.9% and 2.9%, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 576.08 points, or 3.4%, to close at 16,200.08\r\n\r\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was up 64.90% to 38.57. A total of 16.50 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 12.29 billion. The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and 26 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 508 new lows.\n\n“Magnificent Seven” Faces Sharp Decline\n\nOn Monday, major technology stocks, including Alphabet Inc. GOOG, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, and Tesla, Inc. TSLA, experienced significant declines, collectively losing over $600 billion in market capitalization.\r\n\r\nThis decline came after a sell-off that started last week due to disappointing U.S. economic data and concerns about a possible recession.\r\n\r\nGeopolitical tensions, especially impacting chip companies like NVIDIA, also played a part in this downturn as its shares fell by 6.4% despite performing this year.\r\n\r\nThe challenges faced by the tech industry were worsened by issues, including a recent federal ruling against Google for monopolizing search on Android and iPhone devices. Moreover, a significant decrease in Japan's Nikkei 225 index affected U.S. markets, resulting in a 3.3% downturn in the information technology sector.\r\n\r\nConsequently, shares of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN fell 4.1%. Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nU.S. Crude Oil Prices Hit Six-Month Lows\n\nU.S. oil prices took a drop on Monday, hitting their point in six months due to concerns about a possible economic downturn. The September contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) closed at $72.94 per barrel, down 0.79%, marking its lowest settlement since Feb 5. The Brent October contract also saw a decline of 0.66%, settling at $76.30 per barrel.\r\n\r\nWTI prices have nearly wiped out their gains for the year with an increase of 1.8%, while Brent has turned slightly negative for 2024. The decrease in oil prices is indicative of uncertainties and market worries.\r\n\r\nOPEC+ had initially planned to boost oil production from October. These plans may now be up for reassessment. “Don't see OPEC increasing output into this market,” says RBC's Helima Croft — head of a global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomic Data\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management reported that economic activity in the services sector expanded for the 47th time in 50 months, coming in at 51.4 for July.

        "title": "FedEx and UPS must adapt to changing parcel landscape",
        "content": "FedEx and UPS face strong headwinds from Amazon, Walmart and other delivery companies as B2C delivery overtakes the B2B market they were built to serve. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nBy Satish Jindel\n\n(The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of FreightWaves or its affiliates.)\n\nFor decades, FedEx and UPS essentially functioned as a duopoly in the U.S. parcel delivery market. With few challengers, they made lots of money.\n\nThe second-quarter earnings release from UPS on July 23 shocked many investors, resulting in the stock dropping 12% within minutes of the earnings call. The big surprise was that UPS customers are downgrading from Air Express to Ground service and from Ground to the lower-priced SurePost, an economy service that involves injecting parcels into the U.S. Postal Service system for final-mile delivery.\n\nIf the market was paying attention to what the carriers were saying in prior earnings calls, they should have expected these changes. Both FedEx and UPS in recent years have touted how their improved Ground service made transit times faster than those of their competitors. In the process, they also created a competitor to their own Express and Deferred services.\n\nSince 2019, UPS has expedited Ground transit times to the point that delivery time has fallen from three days to two days for 12% of lanes and from three days to two days for an additional 22% of its routes, allowing more express and deferred parcels to be converted to ground. Even SurePost, which takes one to two days longer than Ground service for delivery, has experienced transit time improvements for 7% of packages, prompting customers to downgrade service options.\n\nThe decline of Express and Deferred volumes actually started more than two decades ago. It began when FedEx acquired RPS (rebranded as FedEx Ground) and the industry guaranteed day-definite ground service. In 2000, the FedEx Express operating unit handled 2.92 million parcels per day. Throughput for fiscal year 2024, ended May 31, was 2.58 million parcels. During the same period, FedEx Ground daily volume has increased from 1.52 million to 10.7 million parcels.\n\nFurthermore, with investment in multicarrier manifesting systems from companies like ProShip, and visibility and analytics from companies like ShipMatrix, shippers are now able to utilize cheaper and yet faster ground services.\n\nA major inflection point has been the explosive growth of e-commerce over the past 10 years, which has resulted in 65% of all domestic parcels being delivered directly to consumers. And, with more online orders now fulfilled from local stores or by Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein bringing orders into gateway airports like Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas and Chicago, the last-mile deliveries are being done by smaller companies like Better Trucks, Jitsu, Veho, Uni-Uni and SpeedX, which operate with a lower cost structure.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, while these regional carriers may eventually lose the business to FedEx and UPS, the heightened regional competition forces the giants to operate in shorter shipping zones that have lower margins, resulting in lower yields per parcel.\n\nEqually important is the growth of private fleets by major retailers. Amazon delivering over 22 million parcels per day using drivers employed by its network of delivery service partners. Walmart is doing something similar.\n\n“In Walmart U.S., over the last 12 months, 4.4 billion items were delivered the same or next day, with about 20% of those delivered within three hours,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stated on the company’s May 16 earnings call.\n\nThat means Walmart delivers over 4 million parcels per day from its 4,600 local stores by deploying alternate approaches, including the use of gig workers at companies like Uber Eats and DoorDash typically known for food delivery.\n\nWith the push over the past decade to fulfill online orders from facilities closer to the consumer, the percentage of parcels traveling shorter distances (less than 300 miles) has increased from 45% to 68% while those going 1,400 miles or more have shrunk from 17% to 10%.\n\nThe shift of large e-commerce retailers from Ground to SurePost and UPS’ rollout of a cheaper Ground Saver service with transit time of Ground plus three days illustrates that consumers will accept slower delivery for a lower price of the item. Even Amazon, which has pushed the envelope on faster delivery, is responding to low-cost competition from Temu and Shein.\n\nAmazon recently announced it will offer a discount marketplace for lower-priced items that are shipped from overseas directly to consumers within 10 days of an order by avoiding stocking at more expensive U.S. fulfillment centers.\n\nGiven these monumental developments, by the 2026 peak season the private fleets of major retailers and local companies are positioned to deliver more parcels to residences than FedEx and UPS combined. We’re talking about more than 40 million parcels per day. FedEx and UPS leaders need to prepare for that future.\n\n(Satish Jindel is president of ShipMatrix Inc., a consultancy, and founding member of RPS (now FedEx Ground) who has analyzed trends in the parcel and less-than-truckload sectors for 30 years.)\n\nThe post FedEx and UPS must adapt to changing parcel landscape  appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Rate Cuts Incoming? These 7 Stocks Could Skyrocket",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is telegraphing a possible September rate cut that will supercharge the stock market. If inflation continues to fall, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that “a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table” when the committee next reconvenes in mid-September, leading to the formation of some good stocks for rate cuts.\n\nIf the Fed does cut rates it will prompt the first decrease in lending rates in four years. Lowered borrowing costs will prompt increases in economic activity at all levels. Businesses will have access to cheaper capital that will prompt borrowing to stimulate growth which in turn drives the economy higher in aggregate. Consumers will respond similarly to lower rates. That should stimulate spending across all sectors, sending shares higher.\n\nThat isn’t to say the effects will be felt equally across all sectors of the market. Certain shares tend to fare better in a rate-cut environment. Tech, financial, and consumer discretionary shares tend to perform better for a multitude of reasons. Let’s look at some of those shares which are set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a well-respected real estate income trust (REIT) stock that is truly worth buying. Generally speaking, REITs focused on commercial property and the residential sector do particularly well as rates fall: Rate cuts alleviate substantial pressure in those firms. Realty Income is a commercial REIT that rents commercial properties to industry-leading firms on a long-term basis.\n\nSo, it already enjoys strong performance due to its ability to contract with high-performing firms. Realty Income also operates those contracts under the net lease structure. That means most expenses associated with its properties fall on the lessee and not Realty Income.\n\nREITs like Realty Income have gone largely underappreciated for the past few years as high bond yields have made their dividend income less attractive. That has shifted more recently as bond yields correct. Realty Income should strengthen even more as September approaches and the positive effects of rate cuts become more apparent to potential O investors. None of that even considers the monthly dividend paid by Realty Income. Reinvestment periods are more frequent and that is but one more reason to consider O stock currently.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is sort of an obvious pick among stocks set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts. Tech stocks are generally seen as strong investments as borrowing costs fall. They tend to rely heavily on financing to expand and cheaper lending makes those investments more attractive overall. Amazon, as one of the best tech stocks, benefits as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon currently has more than $135 billion in debt. That debt has an effective interest rate of 1.91% and results in a quarterly interest payment of $2.576 billion. Amazon, like everyone else, benefits from the ability to lower that payment as rates fall.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has more than $85 billion in cash on hand currently. It could find a way to pay off its debt if management decided it was a pertinent strategy. Earnings are expected to grow by approximately 30% on average over the next few years so Amazon’s debt is not a problem. Regardless, it will become more manageable as soon as rate cuts occur.\n\nAmazon will also benefit from a surge in discretionary spending that usually occurs when rates fall. Consumer confidence rises and retailers including Amazon benefit.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going through a patch of trouble that isn’t necessarily reflected in its current stock price. Profit margins are as bad as they’ve been in 5 years and the company continues to cut prices which will only exacerbate its issues. Why then should investors consider TSLA shares?\n\nWell, for one, Tesla is well-positioned to benefit from upcoming rate cuts. As my colleague Larry Ramer noted, Tesla heavily subsidizes the loans used to purchase its vehicles. As rates fall those loans will perform better, improving the bottom line.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that vehicle purchases generally rise in a falling rate environment. Consumers, bolstered by lower lending rates, tend to go out and purchase vehicles more often.\n\nBeyond that, R&D investments also become cheaper. Tesla continues to develop its humanoid robot known as Optimus. Elon Musk is very optimistic about its potential effects on the company and suggests that it could make Tesla a $25 trillion dollar company in the future. However, it has not yet met expectations which is very typical of Tesla projects overall. Anyway, lower rates will cheapen lending used to further research and develop Optimus which is another reason to consider Tesla at the moment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be one of the biggest stories in the stock market today. Its recent decline from $130 to adjust above $100, has irked investors.\n\nPundits had worried that the shares would fall below $100 but at the time of writing, that doesn’t look to be the case. Instead, Nvidia shares jumped by nearly 13% in the 24 hours before this article was written. That sent prices above $117 reinstalling confidence in the AI infrastructure hardware narrative.\n\nNvidia is also a beneficiary of incoming rate cuts for the simple fact that AI spending should increase as rates fall. It’s logical to assume that AI hyperscalers will be upping their investment in Nvidia chips as a result of rate cuts.\n\nNvidia’s revenues are expected to double between this year and 2027. So, even though Nvidia has been volatile this year overall growth is nowhere near over. The growth and return on AI stocks is likely to come in stages. Those stages will not be even but Nvidia will continue to be the best AI hardware play nonetheless among stocks for rate cuts.\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinancial stocks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) generally perform well during rate cuts. JPMorgan Chase is a massive lending center after all: It benefits from a rush of demand as lower rates prompt businesses to invest and drive lending higher.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is the largest U.S. bank and the 5th largest globally as measured by assets. It’s also highly aligned with the business sector and should see greater lending demand than rivals like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) which are more consumer-oriented.\n\nThe company isn’t necessarily a stronger performer overall. But recent consolidation has made it a bigger behemoth and that matters. Investors will be looking to the financial sector and banks in particular as rate cuts occur. JPM shares will be top of mind for the sheer scale of the firm. As a result, it should appreciate in price. Don’t be surprised if share prices continue to rise after an already strong first half in 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is poised to continue its strong performance following rate cuts. 2024 has not been easy for the iPhone seller and tech giant. Most of its 20% returns this year occurred following its AI announcements in June. It continues to deal with the effects of inflation and high rates of discretionary spending for high-priced items including the iPhone. Those effects have been felt globally, particularly in China where sales have slumped dramatically.\n\nDiscretionary spending increases as rates fall. That implies that Apple’s flagging iPhone sales will benefit dramatically if rates fall.\n\nInvestors continue to wonder when high AI capital expenditures will pay off for the tech giants. Apple. Those expenditures have served as a drag on prices of late. AMD’s strong earnings suggest that a clear answer in either direction will take time to emerge and that recent concerns about mega firms are overblown.\n\nApple should benefit significantly from the application of AI to iPhones and the concurrent drop in rates that should prompt increased discretionary spending and boost stocks for rate cuts like AAPL.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has historically performed well as rates come down. The stock performs well for a simple reason: people tend to take out home improvement loans at higher rates as interest rates fall.\n\nNow is arguably a good time to establish a position in Home Depot given that it trades below consensus target prices. Some investors would argue that Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) makes a better trade given its lower valuation. However, Home Depot has always traded at a richer valuation than Lowe’s. It is the dominant home improvement company and with that comes higher prices.\n\nFurthermore, Home Depot is enacting a $500 million cost-cutting initiative which should result in stronger earnings. In turn, that should help to justify HD stock’s richer valuation relative to its main competitor.\n\nIn short, there is a blend of macroeconomic and internal factors at play which should catalyze Home Depot stock to move higher in anticipation of incoming great cuts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Dumping It in Favor of These 3 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, no trend has been hotter on Wall Street than the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee or undertake assigned tasks. The seemingly limitless ceiling attached to the AI revolution traces back to the ability of software and systems to learn without human intervention and evolve over time. The capacity to become more proficient at tasks, or perhaps learn new skills entirely, gives this technology utility in almost every sector and industry of the global economy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough AI is rivaling the internet in terms of game-changing potential for corporate America, optimism isn't universal among Wall Street's brightest (and richest) investors.\n\nBased on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from the March-ended quarter -- a 13F allows investors to see what top money managers have been buying and selling -- more than a half-dozen prominent billionaires were sellers of Wall Street's AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these select billionaire investors were piling into three other hypergrowth AI stocks.\n\nEight billionaire investors meaningfully pared down their stakes in Nvidia\n\nIn short order, Nvidia has become the go-to supplier of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) used in enterprise data centers. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights estimate that Nvidia was responsible for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped to enterprise data centers in 2023.\n\nBut despite having a monopoly on the hardware powering split-second decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers, eight billionaire money managers -- nine, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Nvidia stock during the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (4,415,510 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (4,208,010 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,480,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (3,045,050 shares)\n\nWhile profit-taking might explain some of this selling, history is a potentially bigger concern. All eight of these billionaires have watched for decades as next-big-thing innovations were highly touted, but ultimately failed to deliver early in their existence. Investors have a tendency to overestimate how quickly a new technology will be adopted by consumers and businesses. If this trend persists, it's a matter of when, not if, the AI bubble bursts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive pressures are going to begin weighing on Nvidia, too. Even if it holds onto its compute advantage, which appears likely with the rollout of its next-generation GPU platform (known as Blackwell) on deck, Nvidia's inability to meet all enterprise demand opens the door for cheaper alternatives to thrive.\n\nI'll also quickly mention that Nvidia's four biggest customers by net sales are developing AI chips of their own. Even if this is just complementary hardware, it's reducing data center \"real estate\" for Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nBut while these billionaires were actively selling shares of Nvidia during the March-ended quarter, some were piling into three supercharged AI stocks instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nThe first high-octane AI stock that select billionaire investors were busy buying as they were paring down their stakes in Nvidia is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Altogether, five Nvidia sellers were Palantir stock buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (3,216,525 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,368,832 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (769,965 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (481,634 shares)\n\nThe primary draw for investors to Palantir is that its services are unique at scale. While other companies may offer bits and pieces of the services Palantir provides, no large companies are anywhere close to matching its scope of services. Having a moat and being unique are traits that Wall Street and investors tend to reward with a hearty valuation premium.\n\nFor years, the company's AI-driven Gotham platform has been responsible for much of its growth. Gotham caters to government entities and helps with everything from data collection to mission planning. This segment typically lands multiyear contracts, which is what leads to predictable and somewhat sustainable double-digit growth.\n\nHowever, Gotham has a natural ceiling. This is to say that Palantir isn't going to allow certain governments to use its platform (e.g., China and Russia). Thus, Palantir Technologies' long-term growth opportunity lies with its rapidly growing, but still rough around the edges, Foundry platform.\n\nFoundry is a business-focused platform incorporating AI, machine learning, and optimization models that help businesses make sense of copious amounts of data in order to streamline their operations. Sustained double-digit sales growth should be relatively easy for Foundry throughout the decade.\n\nAmazon\n\nA second hypergrowth AI stock top-notch billionaires were active buyers of in the first quarter is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Two of Nvidia's biggest sellers were some of Amazon's prominent buyers (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its globally leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates minimal operating income and razor-thin margins for the company. What attracts billionaires like Englander and Laffont to Amazon is its considerably faster-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nCloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, unquestionably, the most important puzzle piece. As of the end of 2023, AWS held almost a third of global cloud infrastructure service market share, which is an enviable position to be in considering that enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early stages of ramping up. Amazon is looking to incorporate generative AI solutions within AWS to gives its customers the ability to handle a variety of tasks, ranging from text summarization to image generation.\n\nWhile AWS has, traditionally, accounted for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, subscription services (e.g., Prime) and advertising services are generating sustained double-digit growth, as well. In particular, it's been more than two years since Amazon's advertising services segment delivered less than 20% year-over-year sales growth. This is the advantage of luring more than 3 billion visits to its site each month.\n\nFollowing a post-earnings release sell-off, shares of Amazon are historically cheap, relative to Wall Street's consensus cash flow estimates for the company in 2025.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe third supercharged artificial intelligence stock successful billionaire investors were purchasing as they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is cybersecurity goliath CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). The four billionaires that were making this swap include (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (706,283 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (297,097 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (154,688 shares)\n\nWith hindsight being 20/20, selling Nvidia to buy CrowdStrike isn't looking all too smart at the moment. CrowdStrike is reeling from the repercussions of a cybersecurity update it released three weeks ago, which shut down various networks for airlines, financial firms, and tech companies. Though this issue had nothing to do with a cyberattack, CrowdStrike might face a laundry list of litigation in the months to come as businesses hurt by the outage seek damages.\n\nWhat makes this situation so interesting is that, up to this point, CrowdStrike's cloud-native, AI-driven Falcon security platform has been superior to its peers. Falcon oversees trillions of events each week, and has used each of these events to grow smarter and more effective at spotting and responding to potential end-user threats.\n\nEven though CrowdStrike's security platforms are far from the cheapest, its consistent gross retention of around 98% suggests businesses are willing to pay a premium for its services.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike has had success getting its existing clients to add on new services. Just shy of two-thirds of its clients had adopted five or more cloud-modules as of the end of the fiscal first quarter (April 30, 2024).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in the Sizzling-Hot AI Era",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) cloud computing stocks are benefiting a great deal from the advent and proliferation of artificial intelligence. Cloud providers that are getting the biggest lift from the AI boom are those that provide the data centers where AI systems are “trained and housed,” Matt Biringer, the co-founder and CEO of cloud AI optimization firm North told InvestorPlace in an email.\n\nLaunched last year, North has already “used AI to save companies $20 million in cloud data center costs,” Biringer stated. As more AI is deployed, greater cloud capacity is needed, he explained. Meanwhile, AI also improves cloud providers’ products. That’s because the technology enables firms to avoid using cloud capacity when there’s no demand for it, saving them a great deal of money, Biringer explained. “AI can predict what servers and databases a client actually needs and when, while adjusting the switch accordingly,” he wrote. Here are three top AI cloud computing stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon building at night time with logo light up on building\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe revenue of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, jumped 19% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.3 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting the unit’s sales to climb only 17.6% year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCEO Andy Jassy reported that AWS has a great deal of “potential,” given the likely rapid growth of AI going forward. ” Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days,” the CEO stated on the company’s earnings call.\n\nHe noted that the firm’s AI system, Amazon Bedrock, “has the largest selection of models (and) the best generative AI capabilities in critical areas.” And according to the CEO, “tens of thousands” of companies” are already using Bedrock.\n\nMatt Biringer, the CEO of cloud AI optimization firm North whom I quoted extensively in the introduction to this column, stated that Amazon is already a “big winner” from the AI boom.\n\nGiven Amazon’s quick start when it comes to providing cloud services for AI users, it’s one of the top AI cloud computing stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe revenue of Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud unit, Azure, soared 29% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. While the increase came in slightly below the firm’s previous guidance of a 30%-31% year-over-year increase, it was still a very impressive gain. I believe that Azure’s rapid growth shows that it is benefiting a great deal from the AI boom.\n\nIndeed, Microsoft, reported that its “AI services” had boosted “its Azure and other cloud services revenue” by eight percentage points YOY.\n\nIn a note to investors shortly before Microsoft released its quarterly results, Goldman Sachs wrote that the software giant was benefiting from Azure’s market share gains and its “leadership in [generative artificial intelligence].”\n\nIn light of Azure’s tremendous success when it comes to supporting AI, I view Microsoft as one of the top AI cloud computing stocks to buy.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow’s (NYSE:NOW) software helps its customers migrate their data smoothly and securely to the cloud Moreover, the company owns data centers that “support its cloud-based platform and solutions,” which include AI-based products. Given these points, I put ServiceNow in the category of AI cloud computing stocks.\n\nLast quarter, the net new annual contract value of the company’s AI-capable software, known as Pro Plus, doubled versus the previous quarter, MHMCorgan Stanley reported. Moreover, firms signed 11 deals for Pro Plus that were worth over $1 million in Q2, and ServiceNow was able to increase the price of Pro Plus by over 30%.\n\nAmong the companies that are using Pro Plus are Honda (NYSE:HMC), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Dell (NYSE:DELL).\n\nMeanwhile, ServiceNow expanded in the Middle East last quarter, as it announced that it would “launch a ServiceNow UAE cloud hosted on Microsoft Azure,” The deal will enable the firm to provide its offerings in the UAE. The company also intends to offer more products in India and Southeast Asia.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN and his wife held a long position in NOW.

        "content": "Big Tech companies are spending huge amounts on artificial intelligence (AI) in efforts to benefit from deploying the technology down the road. According to The Financial Times, Big Tech firms increased their capital expenditures by 50% in 2024 to $100 billion in order “to build the infrastructure supporting artificial intelligence.” Among the firms benefiting from this largesse are chip makers, server makers and suppliers of infrastructure for data centers.\n\nMoreover, large tech firms are poised to tremendously boost their spending on AI technologies again next year. Another factor making many AI stocks much more attractive is that their valuations have dropped quite significantly during the tech sector’s current correction. Finally, with a high number of companies outside of tech also beginning to deploy AI on a wide scale, their spending will also boost the top and bottom lines of many AI infrastructure firms and cloud players. Here are three AI stocks to buy on weakness in August.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, is selling software tools used by companies to implement and carry out AI. The division’s revenue jumped 19% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. The increase was meaningfully above analysts’ average estimate of a 17.6% gain. Further, the unit’s operating income came in at $9.3 billion, versus $5,4 billion in Q2 of 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso encouragingly, CEO Andy Jassy reported that the conglomerate is “seeing significant demand” for the AI training chips that it has developed, while “tens of thousands of companies” are using Amazon Bedrock. The latter software provides a framework companies can use to build AI systems relatively quickly and easily.\n\nAlso making me bullish on Amazon stock is the fact that Jassy has not sold any of its shares since July 11. He had unloaded billions of dollars of the company’s shares steadily from July 2 to July 11, but it appears he’s not interested in selling units of the name when it’s trading below $200.\n\nIn light of these points, I view Amazon as one of the best AI stocks to buy on weakness in August.\n\nMicron (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU), which develops computer memory products, reported last month that its top line had soared 81.6% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to $6.81 billion, while its operating cash flow had jumped to $2.48 billion compared with $1.22 billion in Q2 of 2023.\n\nCiting “robust AI demand and strong execution” as the key reasons for the firm’s very strong performance, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted that the company was gaining market share “in high-margin products like High Bandwidth Memory.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the wake of the tech firm’s results, Keybanc raised its price target on the shares to $165, nearly double the name’s current price. Meanwhile, analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to soar to $8.74 next year versus $1.11 this year.\n\nMoreover, despite the company’s very rapid growth, the shares are changing hands at an almost absurdly low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10 times.\n\nGiven the combination of Micron’s rapid growth and low valuation, along with its high leverage to AI, it’s one of the best AI stocks to buy on weakness in August.\n\nVertiv Holdings (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) develops and markets various infrastructure products used by data centers, including “power management products, switchgear…products, [and] thermal management products.” Most AI is being created and implemented by data centers at this point. As a result, the total footprint of data centers is expanding quite rapidly.\n\nConsequently, it’s not surprising that Vertiv reported great Q2 financial results on July 24, as its orders, excluding acquisitions, soared 57% versus the same period a year earlier, while its operating profit advanced 63% year-over-year to $336 million.\n\n“We continue to see increased scaling of AI deployment and Vertiv has the capacity in place to seize this pivotal moment while continuing to invest in capacity for the future,” said CEO Giordano Albertazzi in a statement.\n\nGiven the company’s strong growth and high leverage to AI, its forward P/E ratio of 30 times is quite attractive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AMZN and MU.

        "title": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks Benefiting from Increased Demand",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks are perhaps one of the most attractive multi-year investment trends, driven by the acceleration of digital infrastructure investment. Cloud computing is a huge part of that, with the biggest names in the niche growing at a rapid pace despite the costs involved.\n\nDespite its massive long-term growth trajectory, significant barriers to entry exist in the cloud computing space, making it imperative to stick to the top performers. Given the proliferation of AI, cloud infrastructure investments now follow a compressed cycle. Therefore, cloud space is becoming significantly more demanding, underscoring the long-term case for the best cloud computing stocks.\n\nKeeping that in mind, here are three top cloud computing stocks that have proven incredibly resilient over the past several years. These companies effectively push the envelope in the cloud space to cater to the growing appetite for generative AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to Synergy Research Group, spending on infrastructure services surged 22% to $79 billion during the second quarter (Q2) compared to the prior-year period. This marks the third straight quarter of 20%+ YOY growth, driven by generative AI, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services leading the charge.\n\nDespite the relatively mixed Q2 earnings report, AWS shined for the tech giant, posting an impressive 19% growth to $26.3 billion. Additionally, it blew past Wall Street’s guidance of 17.6% growth for the quarter. CEO Andy Jassy touted AWS’s ongoing momentum, driven by digital infrastructure upgrades and generative AI opportunities. AWS remains the top pick in the cloud due to its broad functionality, superior security and expansive partner ecosystem. Also, Amazon reported a healthy profit of $1.26 per share, up from 65 cents from the prior-year quarter.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a popular cloud computing play specializing in customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. Since going public in 2004, Salesforce has consistently posted strong, strong-and-bottom-line growth backed by strategic acquisitions.\n\nThe stock has been a laggard recently due to lackluster quarters. Hence, it trades at a significant bargain compared to its historical averages as it aims to rebound in the upcoming quarters. CRM is an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors who can weather short-term market fluctuations.\n\nSalesforce’s stock’s upside is linked to its leadership position in AI within the CRM market. Reports suggest the global AI-driven CRM market could blow past $48.4 billion by 2033 at a 10-year CAGR of 28%. Salesforce’s commitment to the niche is evident through Einstein Copilot and partnerships with industry leaders such as IBM (NYSE:IBM).\n\nStory continues\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a hyper-growth stock in the fast-evolving cloud monitoring industry. With cloud adoption rates surging, the firm’s comprehensive platform is positioned well to gain greater market share. Moreover, its management has a clear vision of leveraging digital transformation, expanding DevOps, and continually improving its product offerings. Consequently, it has shown stellar customer retention and upsell capabilities to build on its annual recurring revenue base.\n\nThe firm’s top-line growth has averaged a superb 64% over the past five years. Moreover, despite the tough comps, the company continues posting double-digit growth each quarter, with an 81% gross margin. The firm comfortably blew past estimates across both lines in last year’s four quarters.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz recently upgraded the stock to ‘Outperform’ from ‘Neutral,’’ upping the stock’s price target to $155 from $135. He cites “meaningful” revenue upside due to larger transactions and vendor consolidation with the company’s 2024 revenue guidance as “quite conservative.”\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Google loses antitrust trial in major blow to tech giant",
        "content": "Internet browser search bar with magnifier on computer screen with text Search (igoriss via Getty Images)\n\nThe bedrock of Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) empire sustained a major blow on Monday, after a judge found its search and ad businesses violated antitrust laws.\n\nThe ruling, made by the District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta, sided with the US Justice Department and a group of states in a set of cases alleging the tech giant abused its dominance in online search.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nAlthough Google is expected to appeal the decision, the findings, if upheld, could outlaw contracts that for years all but assured Google's search advertising dominance.\n\nIn 2023, Google's search advertising business generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, both of which it promotes on its general search engine, advertising accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nAs of June 2023, Google controlled 91% of the global search engine market across all computing platforms, according to Statcounter. On mobile, Google's market share was even higher at 95%.\n\nNearly four years ago in October 2020, when the DOJ and states filed suit, Google's annual revenue was $162 billion, roughly half of its most recently reported revenue for the year.\n\nThe decision is a huge win for the Justice Department and could have giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims.\n\nThe scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe Google decision comes after a two-month trial late last year that included testimony from Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, as well as executives from search market rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and DuckDuckGo.\n\nThe DOJ and 35 states, along with Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, accused Google in separate lawsuits of unfairly holding onto its market dominance in search, including search engines, search engine advertising, and search engine text advertising.\n\nThe cases were handled together because of their nearly identical allegations that said Google held on to its monopoly by paying companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Mozilla and Firefox to make Google a default search provider on mobile phones, tablets, and browsers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the time of the lawsuit, Google held a 90% share in online search. At trial, its lawyers said Google earned and held onto that outsized share, not by anticompetitive conduct, but by providing a superior product.\n\nGoogle’s disputed behavior revolved around contracts it entered into with manufacturers of computer devices and mobile devices, as well as with browser services, browser developers, and wireless carriers.\n\nThese contracts, the government claimed, violated antitrust laws because they made Google the mandatory default search provider.\n\nCompanies that entered into those exclusive contracts have included Apple, LG, Samsung, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Mozilla. Those deals are why smartphones from manufacturers including Samsung, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, come preloaded with Google's various apps.\n\nAt trial, Google claimed that despite holding monopolies in the search markets its contracts neither violated antitrust laws nor harmed competition.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing accounts for just 3.74% of the global market across all platforms, while Yahoo Finance's affiliate company Yahoo accounts for 1.16%. In the U.S., Google controls 87% of the search market on all platforms. Bing has 7.2%, Yahoo has 2.4%, and DuckDuckGo has 1.9%. On mobile, Google captures 95% of the U.S. search market.\n\nThe global search industry is also in the midst of a massive shift as companies increasingly add generative AI responses to their services.\n\nGoogle has added its AI Overviews feature to its standard search service, providing users with generative AI-powered answers to their queries that summarize content found on various websites in a dedicated window about the search engine's standard website links.\n\nMicrosoft offers its Copilot feature in its Bing search engine, which provides similar functionality to Google's AI Overviews.\n\nThe move to generative AI-powered search results raises additional questions about the fate of the search industry, including whether websites that are used to summarize AI results receive the appropriate credit for their contributions.\n\nSimilarly, the features have increased concerns that providing users with answers to their queries in a box that grabs content from third-party websites will keep users from visiting those sites, which would dramatically impact their page views and revenue.\n\nAt the end of the trial, legal experts predicted that the DOJ’s landmark cases against Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T in 1974 could be instructive to the outcome of its Google case.\n\nAll three cases are “vertical foreclosure cases,” antitrust challenges that target companies that use the vertical integration of their different businesses or services to foreclose on competition.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Suddenly we’re headed for a recession. Or so it seems on Wall Street. Weak jobs and manufacturing data raised fears that the economy is slowing more rapidly than expected. This has led to an acceleration of the stock market selloff that began in July, with the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index officially entering a correction, defined as a 10% decline from recent highs. In light of this, I’d encourage investors to analyze the S&P 500 stocks to sell to mitigate risks.\n\nWhile many stocks have been dragged lower by the current selloff, some are faring worse than others. Poor second-quarter financial results have also contributed to a downward spiral for many stocks. While investors might be tempted to buy-the-dip in some stocks, that move might be premature with many analysts warning that the current drawdown in equities is likely to get worse in coming weeks.\n\nHere are three S&P 500 stocks to sell before you regret it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.\n\nSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile oil major Chevron’s (NYSE:CVX) Q2 print was mixed, it was largely a disappointment. Unfortunately, the company is struggling to manage lower refining margins, and Chevron reported EPS of $2.55, which missed Wall Street forecasts of $2.93. However, revenue in the quarter of $51.18 billion did manage to beat the consensus expectation of $50.80 billion. Sales were up 5% YOY.\n\nChevron’s production segment posted a profit of $2.16 billion, a 31% increase from $1.64 billion a year earlier. However, that growth was largely offset by profits for international production that declined 30% to $2.30 billion on lower sales and natural gas prices. The real drag on the results was Chevron’s refining business, which recorded a profit of $280 million, a 74% YOY decline. International refining profits dropped 25%.\n\nThe company is also struggling with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). The deal has run into regulatory and legal issues and is unlikely to close before mid-2025. Chevron also said that it is moving its corporate headquarters from San Ramon, California to Houston, Texas to be closer to the center of the U.S. energy sector.\n\nCVX stock is down 7% in the last 12 months. I’d consider CVX one of the S&P 500 stocks to sell.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat’s going on at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)? The e-commerce giant’s stock fell 9% after it reported second-quarter sales figures that missed Wall Street targets and provided weak forward guidance. Amazon announced EPS of $1.26, which exceeded the consensus forecast of $1.03 that was forecast among analysts. However, revenue of $147.98 billion fell short of the $148.56 billion that was estimated on Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps worse than the Q2 revenue miss was Amazon’s guidance, which calls for revenue in the current third quarter of $154 billion to $158.5 billion, representing YOY growth of 8% to 11%. The mid-point of that guidance range is $156.25 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion. In a bizarre twist, management blamed the revenue miss and weak guidance on world events such as the Summer Olympics, which they said distracted consumers and made forecasting difficult.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing unit, posted revenue of $26.30 billion, which was ahead of $26 billion estimated by analysts. However, advertising across the company’s various products and services totaled $12.80 billion, which was below the $13 billion expected. AMZN stock is up 30% over the past 12 months.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetail coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Q2 financial results were not as bad as feared. But that’s not saying much. The company reported EPS of 93 cents, which matched consensus expectations. Revenue of $9.11 billion fell short of the $9.24 billion that had been forecast on Wall Street. Sales were down 1% from a year earlier. Worse, Starbucks said that its same-store sales fell 3%, driven by a 5% decline in transactions at its coffee shops. Foot traffic at the company’s U.S. stores fell 6%.\n\nOutside of North America, same-store sales dropped 7%. In China, Starbucks’ second biggest market, same-store sales plunged 14% as both average ticket and transactions shrank. The poor results were blamed on weak consumer demand and organized boycotts in some international markets. Starbucks is in the process of trying to win back consumers with price discounts and new drinks. Executives have acknowledged that price increases have alienated customers.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Starbucks’ turnaround strategy will work. In the meantime, SBUX stock is down 26% in the last 12 months and one of the worst performers in the benchmark S&P 500 index this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To make matters worse, news from Nvidia -- the poster child for AI, added fuel to the sell-off.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, \"Magnificent Seven\" stock Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) slumped 4%, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) fell 2.8%, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) slipped 1.8%, as of 1:58 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nA check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- revealed nothing in the way of company-specific news to explain the falling stock prices, which suggests many investors are keenly focused two other issues that had far-reaching effects. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFalling dominoes\n\nThere were two separate catalysts that seemed to spark today's wide-ranging market declines.\n\nThe ongoing market rally encouraged some investors to participate in a \"carry trade,\" borrowing Japanese yen at historically low interest rates and using the funds to invest in market leaders, including the Magnificent Seven.\n\nLate last week, the Bank of Japan announced it would raise interest rates to 0.25%, up from 0.10%, in a bid to tame rising inflation. The move also boosted the Japanese yen, which has gained 8%. This sent Japan's stock market into a tailspin as investors sold their profitable trades and rushed to repay the borrowed yen. Furthermore, higher interest rates make borrowing more costly, which puts pressure on corporate profits.\n\nUnfortunately, the stock-selling spread like a contagion, sending markets lower across the globe.\n\nAdding to the market carnage was news that Nvidia might delay the release of its highly anticipated Blackwell AI processor. A story that first appeared in The Information suggested a production design flaw was discovered, which could delay the launch of the next-generation AI chip by three months.\n\nNvidia pushed back, saying \"production is on track to ramp\" later this year, but fair-weather investors were already spooked and rushed to lock in profits.\n\nThe AI catalyst\n\nToday's market rout aside, the next few years are shaping up to be a potentially profitable time for those invested in AI. Estimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, as recognized leaders in the field, these stocks could have much further to run:\n\nNvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are the gold standard for AI training and inference. Sales of its chips have set records, and even a slight delay in the release of its next-generation processor likely won't hurt demand. As the \"big three\" cloud infrastructure providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are well positioned to offer AI services to their cloud customers, as well as integrate the technology across a broad cross-section of their other offerings. Meta Platforms used the reams of data collected from the billions of users on its social media platforms to create its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which it offers to the major cloud providers for a fee -- representing a new revenue stream for the company.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the opportunity, investors would do well to remember that the adoption of AI will play out over years and decades, not days and weeks. As such, it's best to tune out the day-to-day machinations of the stock market and focus on the future.\n\nFurthermore, the resulting upside potential has driven valuations higher. That said, Alphabet and Meta Platforms are both still attractively priced at 21 and 23 times forward earnings, making them relative bargains. Microsoft and Amazon are both fetching a premium at 30 times and 34 times forward earnings, but given their historical performances, I would argue they have earned said premiums.\n\nIn a nutshell, the evidence suggests each of these four stocks is a buy for investors with a long-term outlook.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Markets are reeling this morning, but I would implore investors to do everything they can to keep a cool head. While I cannot guarantee that we are at the exact lows of this selloff, there are a number of market leading stocks currently trading at very appealing levels.\n\nThere has been a confluence of bearish catalysts over the last few days, which we will cover below, but what is most important is that stocks are on sale and the world is not likely to end anytime soon. It can be helpful to take a step back and see that even after this selloff, many stocks and the broad market are still up nicely YTD.\n\nSome of the greatest stocks and companies have moved considerably off their recent highs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and some of the best ETFs like QQQ and SPY.\n\nInvestors don’t need to go all in today, but building your watchlist and buying as the volatility falls should be the plan. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Happened to the Stock Market?\n\nLast week was one of the busiest of the year; we saw earnings from many of the big tech companies, there was an FOMC meeting, a weak employment print pointing to a possible recession and a huge policy shift from the Bank of Japan. If there were a period market to correct like it is today, it seems now is the appropriate time.\n\nSo why did these events cause such a rapid selloff? It started with big tech. At the earnings calls from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms investors were critical of the huge capex being spent on AI, while none of the companies had much profit to show for it. Fears of an AI bubble percolated, and investors began selling many of the AI darlings.\n\nIt should be noted that outside of the large capex, these technology companies posted outstanding earnings and still believe in the long-term value of their AI infrastructure spending.\n\nThen on Friday morning, we saw the second poor employment report of the week. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% and worries of an impending recession spread.\n\nFinally, the monetary policy out of the Bank of Japan threw the final wrench into this bearish trifecta. Japan has been far behind the other central banks in terms of tightening monetary policy and only just began to hike interest rates last week.\n\nThe reason why this affected the US stock market is a little complicated, but basically it removed funding for cheap money. What happened is that the carry trade is being unwound. Because interest rates were so low in Japan, investors would borrow money in Yen terms and would take that leveraged money buy stocks and other assets around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo essentially, because this funding mechanism is going away, many investors are being margin called on their borrowed money, causing further selling.\n\nWill Stocks Continue to Fall?\n\nI lean towards this correction being much closer to the end than the beginning. Although the causes of the selloff are concerning, they are very likely transient. Yes, the unemployment rate jumped, but the US economy shows no additional signs of recession. Furthermore, the Fed is about to start cutting interest rates, which will be a boon for the economy and stock market.\n\nAs for the Yen carry trade unwind, we are in the midst of it, but that too is being priced into the market right now. Unless there are more systemic issues related to it, then it too will fade.\n\nAs for AI, I think this catalyst is the most uncertain moving forward. Was it just hype or will it produce the productivity and profit gains it promised? I think it likely will, but it may be over a longer timeline than investors originally thought.\n\nThe big tech companies are absolutely gushing with profits and are growing their businesses at very impressive rates still. Investors are going to recognize this, and buyers are going to step in.\n\nLeading Technology Stocks on Sale (Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta)\n\nAll my favorite stocks are on sale today. Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Meta Platforms are all growing like startups, yet they are trillion-dollar, mammoth companies. Amazon is expected to grow its earnings 30% annually over the next 3-5 years while Meta is expecting 20%. It is a bit slower at Alphabet and Apple, with 17.5% and 12.7% respectively, but those are still great growth rates.\n\nAll the stocks in the group are also trading at reasonable valuations. AMZN, META and GOOGL are all trading below their 10-year median valuations, with AAPL still trading at a premium.\n\nHowever, both Apple and Amazon enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. But most notably, all these companies posted truly incredible quarterly earnings results, demonstrating the deep roots of their businesses.\n\nIf you are an investor that likes simplicity, picking up a technology ETF like Invesco QQQ might be the simplest strategy. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and has been one of the best performing ETFs in the market over the last 10 years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBe Greedy and Buy Stocks when Others are Fearful\n\nEveryone knows the mantra, but when it comes time to be greedy, many investors are paralyzed. All of a sudden investors are talking about waiting for another leg down, but it never comes.\n\nYes, it can be difficult to step up and buy when it looks like the world is going to end but that’s how you get discounts.\n\nI will say, don’t try to catch a falling knife. There is nothing wrong with waiting for the volatility to die down and for stocks to start consolidating sideways. But don’t overthink this market environment too much, this appears to be a buying opportunity.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data",
        "content": "Market whiplash\n\nLast week started out with disappointing results from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the middle of the week both Fed commentary which nearly confirmed a September rate cut and outstanding Meta (NASDAQ:META) results lifted markets, only to be undone on Thursday and Friday by weaker-than-expected jobs data.\n\nEarnings season continues to plod along, with more companies beating earnings per share estimates than the long-run historical average, yet the amount by which these companies are beating is less than usual. Mega tech results, closely watched for signs of continuing artificial intelligence demand, came in mixed. In addition to AI updates, there were other key metrics that investors were watching closely. For Microsoft, slowing cloud revenues caused investor's to punish the stock after the report.[1] Meta shares were rewarded after they reported strong ad revs and better-than-expected revenue guidance for Q3.[2] By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock took a leg lower after reporting waning ad revenues.[3] Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the wild card here, and although sales in China continued to bottom-out, better-than-expected revenues for the iPhone and Services segments led to an uptick after the report.[4]\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 11.50% year over year, an increase from 9.80% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 59% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nThe FOMC meeting and economic data were also in focus this week. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed the first rate cut since 2020 would likely occur at the September meeting.[7] There is also a high probability of rate cuts at the November and December meetings as well according to the CME FedWatch tool.[8] An additional three cuts are expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nNow the question is becoming whether or not the Fed waited too long to cut rates as certain economic indicators show signs of weakening. On Tuesday, the June JOLTS report showed that job openings slowed for the month, and both hiring and quit rates decreased.[9] The cooling jobs data continued on Thursday when Initial Jobless Claims came in higher-than-expected for the week prior.[10] It all culminated with a disappointing June jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) of 114,000 were well-below expectations, unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate in nearly three years, and wage growth grew less than anticipated.[11] In response, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all down more than 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe final (and busiest) peak week of the second-quarter season is up\n\nThis week concludes the final peak week for the second quarter earnings season with 3,908 companies expected to report from a smattering of industries. Big names include: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and more.? The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[12]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Fifteen companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), CSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX), IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX), DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT), NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI), Global Payments, Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK), Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD).\n\nCSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday Aug. 5, AMCProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday July 18, AMCDateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nCSX is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, Aug. 5, over two weeks later than usual, and the first time they've ever reported the second quarter in the month of August. This also appears to be their first Monday report in at least the last decade, as they usually favor a Tuesday or Wednesday report date.\n\nOn March 26, a massive container ship crashed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse and closing the port for the majority of the second quarter. Baltimore is the second-largest coal export port, and CSX has a major coal shipping segment which was negatively impacted by the closing of the port.[13] In the quarters prior to this disaster, CSX and its peers have been dealing with a global freight recession, which experts believe has bottomed, but freight rates will likely remain low in 2025 on the road to recovery.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday August 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nCaterpillar is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. This also pushed results into the 32nd week of the year, while the industrials giant tends to report in the 30th or 31st week of the year. This would be the latest second-quarter report ever for CAT.\n\nCaterpillar tends to serve as a bellwether for global economic health as the world's leading manufacturer of machinery and construction equipment. Last quarter the company warned that sales were cooling as dealers tightened up on equipment inventories after a multi-month boom in demand.[14] Investor's will be looking for updates on machinery sales which could indicate something broader about the global economy.\n\nVF Corp. (NYSE:VFC)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday Aug. 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nVF Corp. is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. Since switching to a fiscal year end of March 31 in 2018, this is the latest they've reported first-quarter results, and the first time they've reported them in the 32nd week of the year.\n\nOn May 22, VFC announced they had tapped Spotify's Paul Vogel as their new CFO.[15] Vogel took his post on July 8, which could explain the later than usual earnings date. VFC like many other apparel companies has struggled this year to attract consumers that are increasingly more discerning with how they spend their discretionary dollars, especially as many of the brands they own (North Face, Vans, Timberland) tend to be on the middle-higher end.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis marks the final peak week of the second-quarter earnings season, with 3,908 companies expected to report. Currently Aug. 8 is predicted to be the most active day with 1,411 companies anticipated to report. Thus far 80% of companies have confirmed their earnings date (out of our universe of 11,000+ global names), and 37% have reported results.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Internet - Commerce stocks have likely encountered both Amazon (AMZN) and Coupang, Inc. (CPNG). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\n\nRight now, Amazon is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Coupang, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that AMZN's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nOur Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.\n\nAMZN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 36.28, while CPNG has a forward P/E of 2,028. We also note that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CPNG currently has a PEG ratio of 2,007.92.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for AMZN is its P/B ratio of 7.39. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CPNG has a P/B of 8.91.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, AMZN holds a Value grade of B, while CPNG has a Value grade of C.\n\nAMZN sticks out from CPNG in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that AMZN is the better option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The video game industry is booming as nostalgia and active entertainment join forces. The industry is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 13.4% from now until 2030.\n\nSmartphones have created new avenues for game makers. While consoles and paid games still have a large portion of the market, mobile games are free and offer a lower barrier to entry.\n\nHowever, video game companies still make money from these apps through in-game transactions and advertisements. Paid downloadable content and subscription plans give companies additional ways to profit from this industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s also a large segment of consumers who don’t play video games but prefer to watch people on streaming sites like Twitch and YouTube, owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Some creators make more than $1 million per year by streaming video games, and you better believe that the companies are making a lot more.\n\nSome gaming stocks have been leveling up portfolios for several years while outperforming the S&P 500. Gaming stocks can also navigate recessions better than most stocks, as gaming presents a way for people to temporarily escape their financial hardships and other obstacles.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a dominant force in multiple industries. Cloud revenue is the biggest component and makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue.\n\nHowever, it also has a large market share of the gaming industry thanks to Xbox. That part of Microsoft’s business grew by 62% YOY in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, largely due to the recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nOverall revenue jumped by 17% YOY while net income was up by 20% YOY.\n\nThe tech giant has a good history of market outperformance. Shares are up by 8% year-to-date and have almost doubled over the past five years. The stock offers a 0.73% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts believe that the stock can rally from current levels. The average price target implies that Microsoft can gain an additional 19%. The tech conglomerate is rated as a “Strong Buy” among analysts as well.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in a similar position to Microsoft. It’s winning in numerous industries, with e-commerce, cloud computing and advertising as some of the highlights.\n\nSome people turn to Amazon’s online marketplace to buy video game consoles and devices, but that’s not the reason why Amazon is on this list.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech conglomerate owns many companies, such as Whole Foods, Audible and Zappos. However, Amazon also notably owns Twitch, one of the top streaming platforms for video game enthusiasts.\n\nThe average Twitch user watches video game livestreams for 95 minutes per day. Amazon generates revenue as viewers watch advertisements and donate to their favorite creators.\n\nKeeping people in the Amazon ecosystem can also drive up more sales for Amazon’s online marketplace and Prime memberships.\n\nAmazon is one of the top holdings in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Most investors are happy about that news, since Amazon stock is up by 8% year-to-date.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) has produced many iconic video game series and has an engaged core audience. The company boasts high profit margins that exceed 30% in some quarters.\n\nThe stock has delivered a 9% return over the past year for investors and is up by 27% over the past five years.\n\nThe video game giant’s revenue increased by 4.4% YOY in fiscal 2024. Nintendo also achieved a 20.1% return on equity during the year.\n\nHowever, the stock is likely to drum up significant growth in the next 1-2 years. That’s because Nintendo is going to announce a successor to its wildly popular Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe company’s Nintendo Switch 2 should be announced before March 31, 2025. There hasn’t been much public information about the new device, but it should generate a surge in sales. A new console and new titles should bolster demand for the company’s games.\n\nNintendo also has a great opportunity with movies. There is a big void in the box office, and Nintendo is one of the few companies that can fill it. The success of the Super Mario Bros Movie is a testament to how much of an impact movies can have on Nintendo’s bottom line.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT and AMZN.

        "content": "2024 has been a great year for S&P 500. The S&P 500 is a market index of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. stock market exchange, accounting for almost four-fifth of the entire market cap of publicly traded companies in the U.S.\n\nAs of writing, the S&P 500 is up almost 15% year-to-date and the index increased by more than 700 points. It has had the best start in the presidential election year history, and the economy overcame the fear of the anticipated recession from high interest rates.\n\nThe gains were driven by mega cap AI companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). While some investors may bring up concerns about rising high concentration in a handful number of tech giants, history proves that the returns are better under a concentrated market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are the best three S&P 500 stocks to buy this summer.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe tech giant Alphabet is part of the Magnificent Seven that has proven to be a winning long term investment. It is one of the five publicly traded U.S. companies with over $2 trillion market cap.\n\nOne of the most noticeable changes in Alphabet’s business is in Google Cloud. Just four years ago, Google Cloud reported a 42.9% operating margin loss and remained unprofitable until 2022. However, this changed in FY 2023 when it finally broke even and delivered a 5.2% profit margin for the year. It is now the third largest cloud computing vendor, owning 11% of the global market share.\n\nWhile it is still a distant third behind Amazon and Microsoft, cloud computing is a rapidly growing market that has more than tripled in revenue since 2016, and considering that Google Cloud’s profit margins are continually improving, this might be the new growth engine for Alphabet’s next decade.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCompared to the rest of the S&P 500 companies, Visa (NYSE:V) has not had the best year so far. The stock is up by only 2%, and the fintech giant also missed the earnings for the second quarter. However, considering Visa’s relative underperformance in the first half of 2024 yet still a solid market position and profitable business model, this makes a good buying case for long term investors.\n\nVisa’s business model has proven to bring success. With 4.4 billion Visa cards circulating in over 200 countries, Visa has been dominating the payments industry for decades. As the largest payment processor in the world, Visa makes money on data process, service and transaction fees. Last year, Visa was responsible for 283.2 billion transactions valued at more than $15 trillion. The fees are only going to go up from now as the world shifts towards online payments, meaning higher profit for Visa.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock on this list is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). It is the largest retailer in the world and has over 10,500 stores and clubs. Its business model is simple yet extremely effective: offer a broad selection of everyday consumer items at affordable prices and sell as many as possible.\n\nThe stock is up already over 30% this year, and its sales are just simply impressive. However, the most impressive figures come from its eCommerce sales. It is up 20% from the previous year, and while it still falls short compared to other eCommerce specialists, it certainly means a positive sign to investors that Walmart is growing its online platform presence.\n\nEarlier this year, Walmart went through a 3-for-1 stock split, making it an affordable stock priced under $100. If anyone, Walmart will be the first retailer to join the trillion dollar club. Investors should buy Walmart stock before it becomes expensive.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andy Kim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Jeff Bezos Is Putting His Money Behind AI, Meet The Unicorns Earning His Dollars\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nJeff Bezos may have lost over $15.2 billion in last Friday’s tech swoon in the stock market. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares closed down nearly 9% at $167.90 after the company missed Wall Street’s sales targets. Bezos recently filed plans to sell 25 million shares worth approximately $5 billion.\n\nBezos is well accustomed to having his net worth fluctuate with market changes and it doesn’t seem to slow down his spending habits, whether it is his real estate portfolio spread from Seattle to Miami, his $500 million yacht, or his substantial venture capital investments. CNBC recently reported on the investments made by Bezos Expeditions, his family office. Data from FINTRX found that all of his investments this year have been in artificial intelligence.\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nBezos started the family office in 2005 and through the years it has primarily focused on technology, with 70% of its investments in that camp. As Bezos moves toward artificial intelligence, that may reflect not just his interests but the number of exciting companies starting up in that space and the potential for significant advancements and lots of money.\n\nOne of his investments is Perplexity AI, which builds an AI search engine. It raised $63 million in April, pushing it into unicorn territory with a billion-dollar valuation. Perplexity, which uses a variety of large language models to deliver its results, was recently accused of plagiarism. It has instituted a publisher program to compensate publishers with a share of ad revenue when their content comes up in search results.\n\nAnother unicorn in the Bezos stable is Skikd AI, which works on the operating system for multipurpose robots that can be used everywhere from construction sites and factories to homes. Bezos Expeditions was part of a $300 million funding round that included investments from Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and SoftBank Group. The funding brings the company to a valuation of $1.5 billion.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third unicorn may be the biggest of them all, at least so far. Figure raised $675 million in February with support from Bezos and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the OpenAI Startup Fund, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and others. Figure is an AI robotics company that builds humanoid robots. It is collaborating with OpenAI on AI models to create robots that can process and reason from language. Figure and BMW are partnering to bring humanoid robots into automotive production.\n\nOne of the largest AI companies, Anthropic, has received over $4 billion in investments from Amazon. It is big enough now that it is launching its own fund to support new AI talent. Anthropic and Menlo Ventures, a well-established Bay Area venture capital firm, recently announced the Anthology Fund. It will offer financial backing through Menlo Ventures and $25,000 in credits for using its large language models.\n\nAll these monster rounds and Bezos's contribution to them may indicate that the most prominent AI companies are yet to hit the market. For stock market investors, most of the opportunities to invest in AI so far have come from established companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia. While none of the companies above have indicated that they are planning for an initial public offering anytime soon, it seems likely that at least one of them will at some point.\n\nCheck it Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThis article Jeff Bezos Is Putting His Money Behind AI, Meet The Unicorns Earning His Dollars originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -16.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 12.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +40% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +59.7%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.87 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $156.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $635.77 billion and $705.37 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +11% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Jeff Bezos’s longstanding leadership rules are showing signs of fraying inside Amazon",
        "content": "Good morning!\n\nThere are few companies that have created cultures as all-consuming as Amazon.\n\nAmazonians are famous for their six-page memos. They have a “two-pizza rule” that defines how small certain teams should be based on how much they need for a meal. But perhaps most importantly, they have 16 leadership principles. These range from “Customer obsession,” to “Bias for action,” to “Disagree and commit,” but they’ve all been encoded into the company’s DNA for decades.\n\nThe upside is a company-wide understanding of mission, and a “granular level” knowledge up and down the corporate ladder about how things work within the company. The downside is a corporate culture that borders on fanaticism, with the occasional weaponization of principles to the detriment of people and groups with less power.\n\nBut what was once an agreed-upon set of rules permeating every facet of company life has shown signs of fraying, writes my colleague Jason Del Rey in a new feature. Not only have they become more diluted, but many managers say the focus has shifted away from guiding good work, and more towards criticizing fellow employees.\n\nThe source of the change can be traced in part to the pandemic. Amazon did booming business during the height of COVID, doubling its headcount within two years, and hiring new executives from outside. These managers were introduced to company culture via Zoom rather than in-person gatherings, and were less familiar—as well as devoted—to the company’s old-school culture.\n\nThe differences are noticeable. There are now PowerPoint presentations at times in place of the famous six-pagers. One VP has directed her team to begin with a one-page memo, and increase it to six as needed. And when Amazon was in the spotlight during the massive unionization efforts of warehouse workers, and sued by the FTC for alleged antitrust activity, the company’s attempt to add two more principles went over like a lead balloon: “Strive to be the Earth’s best employer,” and “Success and scale bring broad responsibility.”\n\n“They are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,” one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy recently released an hour-long video explaining the principles. But the issue begs a larger question: Should companies stay true to their original playbook, or are they only useful to management during a certain period of time?\n\n“The company has shifted and grown,” says Beryl Tomay, the VP of Amazon’s transportation division. “So you have to keep adapting.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAzure Gilman \r\nazure.gilman@fortune.com\n\nToday's edition was curated by Emma Burleigh.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) has experienced its worst-ever daily selloff on Monday, amid panic selling triggered by fears of a possible US recession that is spilling over to European markets.\n\nAt the close in Tokyo on Monday, the benchmark index was down 4,451.28 points, or 12.40%, to 31,458.42.\n\nIt is the largest point fall ever, eclipsing the decline on 20 October 1987, the day after Black Monday in New York. It is the second largest decline in percentage terms, according to Nikkei data.\n\nThe panic selling extended across Asia, with markets in Singapore (^STI), Indonesia (^JKSE), Thailand (^SET.BK), and the Philippines (PSEI.PS) also experiencing drops of 2% to 3%. These declines triggered circuit breakers, temporarily halting trading for 20 minutes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks dip as Japan's Nikkei slumps\n\nJapanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki expressed \"grave concern\" as the government closely monitors the market situation.\n\nAsian markets getting hammered this morning.

There are a lot of moving parts, but this is the essence of things: a looming slowdown in the US economy has cast doubts about global economic growth.\n\n\"The move has triggered a sell-off in the US dollar and a rally in the yen, the latter of which was boosted by the BOJ’s [Bank of Japan's] decision to tighten policy last week and a subsequent short-squeeze.\n\n“The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it’s also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks. We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Disney, Airbnb, Bitcoin, Pershing Square\n\n“The rapidity of the move has caught a lot of investors off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”\n\nThe market rout has spilled over, with US treasury yields falling further, European stock indexes in the red, bitcoin dumped and the dollar losing ground mainly to the yen.\n\nLondon’s blue-chip index (^FTSE) was as much as 2.22% down, losing 196 points to hit 7,978.59 at the time of writing, with equities across the board falling into the red. It is the sharpest fall in London’s benchmark index since July last year.\n\nThe Dax (^GDAXI) in Frankfurt sank more than 2.6% while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slumped 2.3%. Elsewhere, Milan (FTSEMIB.MI) plunged 3.1% and Madrid (^IBEX) gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency (BTC-USD) fell by 15% to $51,400, adding to a 13.1% drop last week.\n\nIt has suffered its worst fall since the so-called “crypto winter” when the FTX exchange imploded in 2022.\n\n#Bitcoin is down more than 16% in the past 24 hours. This is a stark reminder that Bitcoin is, by far, the asset class with the highest #volatility, which must be considered when constructing a portfolio that includes Bitcoin.\r\n(The Bitcoin Emergency Brake in the Blokland Smart… pic.twitter.com/5b6jDkNgEr\n\n— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) August 5, 2024\n\nBig Tech stocks are heading for further losses when Wall Street trading begins.

        "title": "3 Vulnerable Stocks That Could Crash Hard This Quarter",
        "content": "With the painful market sell-off kicking things up a notch to start the month of August, it’s not hard to imagine many investors are seeking an exit point from some of their vulnerable stocks. Indeed, those “AI bubble” fears you may have heard about feel more real than ever. This is especially true with the Nasdaq 100 sinking into correction territory in just a few weeks.\n\nThough it’s always scary to catch a falling knife, market sell-offs do tend to be great buying opportunities in the grander scheme of things. At least this is true for pain-tolerant investors.\n\nFor everybody else, the latest sell-off may be ringing alarm bells. This is especially true for semiconductor investors who’ve refused to take profits amid the past few years of incredible gains. It’s impossible to tell which stocks will crash from here and by how much. However, the following names, I believe, look technically unsound and still expensive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTime will tell how the market sell-off plays out in August. I think it’ll be a great longer-term buying opportunity for those who pick their spots carefully. However, if you’re too heavy in the following names, it’s likely not too late to do some trimming.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) seems like the perfect stock to bet against if you believe there’s an AI bubble bursting. Though I don’t view AI stocks as in a dot com era-esque type of bubble, it’s hard to argue that a lot of froth has built up in some of the past year’s biggest AI winners.\n\nAt the time of this writing, SMCI stock is rolling over fast. The AI data center top dog has shed more than 47% of its value since peaking back in March. Despite getting cut nearly in half, SMCI shares are still up 118% year to date. Clearly, the stock could get cut in half again and still be in the green on the year.\n\nWith the company launching an intriguing plug-and-play infrastructure solution for the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Omniverse, the firm is making shows that it still has the AI growth chops. And while the stock looks like a steal at 34.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s tough to get behind the name as investors turn against tech and AI in a big way.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) added fuel to the broad stock market sell-off after it missed the mark on revenues for the second quarter. In response, AMZN stock plunged almost 9%, as investors quickly threw in the towel on the fast-recovering Magnificent Seven e-commerce kingpin.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, Amazon’s top line technically fell short of estimates, but not by much. Net sales of $147.98 billion were just a hair shy of the $148.56 billion estimate—a miss by less than a percentage point!\n\nMeanwhile, cloud growth came in at a somewhat decent 19%, ahead of estimates but still less than some faster-moving public cloud firms. Relatively speaking, Amazon Web Services is walking briskly while some rivals may be sprinting into the cloud with AI.\n\nIn any case, I think the 9% single-day dip was overblown beyond proportion. Despite this, I’d not want to catch the falling knife immediately after earnings, as it’s still up a great deal from the 2022 lows. Still, this is one of the most vulnerable stocks.\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) stock, which shed another 5% of its value last Friday as broader markets crumbled. While the maker of yoga wear is insulated from the blast zone of AI and tech, the company has its own slate of unique woes that could be very hard to recover from.\n\nTrendy fashions, like athleisure, tend to be just that: trendy. And, as you may know, chasing hot trends can be a risky endeavor as an investor. I have no idea where Lululemon goes from here as its stock sinks to multi-year depths not seen since 2020.\n\nWith the apparel firm recently getting slapped with a major downgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Brooke Roach, perhaps it’s time to part ways with LULU stock for good. Roach cut her price target by a whopping $177 to $286 per share.\n\nWhy is Roach’s confidence “fading” on the name?\n\nLululemon’s new Breezethrough leggings, which were paused in response to harsh customer criticism, have Roach concerned about “near-term execution.” She’s spot-on; the downgrade is more than warranted. Breezethrough was a disaster that couldn’t have come at a worse time and certainly one of the most vulnerable stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Amazon.

Moreover, the AI sector is seen as entering a new growth phase, reminiscent of the early days of the internet.\n\nThis earnings season has reinforced Wedbush's positive outlook, with strong performances and optimistic forecasts from major tech players.\n\nThey note that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have shown robust cloud growth, and the AI monetization phase is gaining momentum.\n\n\"We focus on tech spending and the winners that will be front and center in this massive AI tech buildout,\" Wedbush emphasizes.\n\n\"We would strongly focus more on what is happening at the likes at Apple (bullish conf. call and outlook from Cook), Nvidia, Microsoft (Azure 2H accel), Alphabet, Amazon (AWS monster number), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as barometers and see the forest through the trees despite this morning's carnage,\" they concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nNow not the time to panic on the tech trade, bargain hunt after selloff: Wedbush\n\nElon Musk revives lawsuit against Sam Altman and OpenAI, filing shows\n\nTyson Foods beats Q3 estimates, shares rise on strong results\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. Beat Analyst Estimates: See What The Consensus Is Forecasting For This Year",
        "content": "Last week, you might have seen that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) released its second-quarter result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 8.4% to US$168 in the past week. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$148b were what the analysts expected, Amazon.com surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$1.26 per share, an impressive 23% above what was forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Amazon.com's 57 analysts is for revenues of US$635.6b in 2024. This reflects a credible 5.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 11% to US$4.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$638.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.58 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Amazon.com's earnings potential following these results.\n\nThere's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$221, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Amazon.com at US$251 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$180. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Amazon.com's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 11% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 16% over the past five years. Compare this to the 33 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 10% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Amazon.com is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Amazon.com's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$221, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

        "content": "The rapid adoption of cloud technologies in the last decade has served as a boon for cloud computing stocks. The technology offers businesses and individuals a plethora of benefits — namely increased scalability, efficiency and lower IT costs. This has been amplified by the emergence of GenAI which spurred a new wave of growth, catapulting cloud computing companies to new heights.\n\nThese benefits alone give cloud computing companies plenty of staying power but the industry is poised for substantial growth. Data shows that the market for cloud technologies currently valued at $0.68 trillion will reach $1.44 trillion by 2029. That represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%.\n\nWhile the cloud computing market is a competitive one, it is largely dominated by a few tech companies. Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure control over half of the market share for cloud technologies. However, beyond the big names, there’s a host of mid-sized companies that show promise for long-term gains. Here’s a look at three names vying for a piece of the pie.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to cloud computing, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a major player in the space. The company was an early mover in the industry and one of the first companies to dabble in cloud technology. Today, its customer relationship management (CRM) system offers software critical to several industries. This includes several communication channels for marketing and commerce along with data analytics tools. This has led to substantial growth for Salesforce in the last decade.\n\nSalesforce holds a strong market position with a high-growth business model but its recent earnings were a mixed bag. Earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter of FY25 came in at $2.44 beating the estimated $2.38 per share. Revenue grew 11% year-over-year (YOY) to $9.13 million but missed analysts’ expectations by $40 million. The company touted macroeconomic headwinds as a major reason for the dip in revenue.\n\nNevertheless, Salesforce’s long-term prospects remain strong and the dip presents a great buying opportunity. The company has seen consistent sales growth since its public market debut in 2004. Moreover, CRM tools remain a critical component for many organizations and as a leader in the space, demand for its platform will sustain its growth trajectory.\n\nCRM stock is one of the top cloud computing stocks on the market for investors seeking a long-term play.\n\nStory continues\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is an enterprise software maker that helps businesses handle large amounts of data with ease. Companies can store their data on its AI-powered centralized platform to support a more collaborative work environment and prevent data silos. Needless to say, the IT giant was a large beneficiary of the emergence of AI which catapulted its growth to new heights. This was fairly evident in its impressive second-quarter numbers.\n\nServiceNow delivered several key wins in Q2. Subscription revenues for the period climbed 25% YOY to $2.54 billion. This was largely fueled by the demand for its GenAI cloud platform that secured 11 contracts worth over $1 million. This business will serve as a major growth tailwind in the coming years. Total revenue rose by 24% with earnings at $3.13 per share. Looking ahead, the company anticipates a 20% increase in subscription revenue for the current quarter and a 22% increase for the full year.\n\nWith strong financials and plenty of growth prospects, NOW stock has the potential to generate mouth-watering returns for investors in the long haul. Investors seeking a high-reward play will put ServiceNow among the top cloud computing stocks on the market.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that helps businesses manage their infrastructure through its cloud-based platform. It does this by providing real-time visibility on the company’s servers and databases to help troubleshoot problems before they occur. Like many of its cloud computing peers, Datadog leverages AI and uses its chatbot Bits AI to assess potential issues.\n\nDespite facing macroeconomic headwinds, the company has managed to put up some impressive results over the years. Its CAGR from 2018 to 2023 was 61%. Although it experienced a slowdown in 2023 as it reined in costs amidst declining industry growth, 2024 is shaping up to be a strong year. Revenue in Q1 grew 27% YOY and beat analysts’ estimates, giving investors plenty to celebrate. Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued momentum and expects full-year revenue to fall in the $2.59 billion to $2.61 billion range.\n\nDatadog’s earnings signal massive upside potential for the company. While the stock isn’t cheap at 69 times forward earnings, its strong market position and solid growth prospects are likely to sustain its growth trajectory. This makes DDOG one of the most compelling cloud computing stocks on the market today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "Wall Street will support heavy AI spending as long as everything else is going great",
        "content": "Sifting through the financial wreckage of last week's pullback illuminates an evolution in the AI trade.\n\nAs Big Tech giants reported results this earnings season, Wall Street didn't mind heavy AI spending, but with one key caveat: Everything else in the business had to be humming along.\n\nThe big winner of this shift was Meta (META), with its CEO Mark Zuckerberg — fully embracing his post-metaverse, gold chain glow-up — showing that investors won't automatically shy away from massive investments with an uncertain future.\n\n\"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year,\" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.\n\nThe warning of bigger AI outlays didn't deter Wall Street. Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta, speaks at the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques, July 29, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat's because Zuckerberg and company delivered on the top and bottom lines, flashing financial strength even as they pushed the tech world's boundaries for capital expenditures. Revenue grew 22% in the second quarter and income grew 58%.\n\nAnd despite losses at its Reality Labs segment reaching $4.5 billion during the quarter, this spending fell to 31% from almost 40% as a share of its total income from operations.\n\nAs Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call last week, \"We are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we're seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future. And I plan to fully seize that opportunity.\"\n\nBut as soon as tech companies confessed some weakness in their core operations, that's when the trouble started. And Meta's peers revealed the flip side of that dynamic.\n\nReactions to earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) showed AI investments can become a liability when key business lines fail to meet expectations.\n\nThursday's report from Amazon, which disclosed a weaker sales and profit outlook, wrapped a wave of Big Tech results that highlighted impatience over massive AI spending.\n\nCloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet posted lower-than-expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors fleeing.\n\nThe key difference — as the broader market contends with last week's bruising jobs report — is that Facebook's parent company dazzled at the basics, making its outsized spending seem like an ambitious proposition instead of a misguided adventure.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, AI spending is necessary for such a promising, long-term bet. Underinvesting, in his view, is the riskier path, since the downside is falling behind while the rest of the industry and the world transforms.\n\nBut investors and analysts are no longer taking daring AI plans at face value.\n\nIronically, Facebook's outlandish pivot to the metaverse several years ago serves as a cautionary tale — in 2022, Meta stock fell over 60%.\n\nSkeptics liken the recent frenzy over generative AI to Zuckerberg's prior pet project, which also cost a lot of money and dragged the company's share price into deep water. Wedbush analysts, standing in for AI bulls, say the analogy doesn't fit. They see AI development as a genuine inflection point.\n\n\"Is accelerated capex a good or bad thing?\" the firm wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly contrast this is not Meta/Zuckerberg spending on metaverse from 2 years ago, instead this is an AI arms race taking place in the US, China, and around the globe for building out the enterprise and consumer AI ecosystem.\"\n\nZuckerberg appears to have learned his lesson, sticking his neck out knowing he's on solid footing with an unstoppable ads machine.\n\nFor everyone else talking up their big, expensive AI plans, Wall Street's message is more circumspect: We'll believe you, but show us the money in the meantime.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Chipmakers crushed on US recession concerns",
        "content": "Shares in chipmakers plummeted significantly on Monday amid a global market sell-off, with Japanese stocks plunging by more than 12% due to growing concerns over a potential U.S. recession.\n\nThe fears spurred investors to flee from riskier assets, betting that a series of swift rate cuts might be necessary to support economic growth.\n\nSafe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw substantial gains as investors unwound crowded carry trades, leading to speculation that some were selling profitable positions to cover losses elsewhere. The intensity of the sell-off triggered circuit breakers across Asian exchanges.\n\nSemiconductor stocks, many of which enjoyed substantial gains in recent years driven by the AI boom, fell sharply in premarket trading Monday. The AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was down 9% at the time of writing, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged 5%, 4% and 4.6%.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 6.5%, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) tumbled 7.6%, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) dipped 5%.\n\nBut the sell-off extends much beyond chipmakers, with Nasdaq 100 Futures futures tumbling 4.7%, and S&P 500 futures falling 2.8%, reflecting the global nature of the market turmoil.\n\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures declined 2.1%, while FTSE futures slipped 1.2%. Japan's Nikkei dropped a staggering 12.4%, reaching seven-month lows, a level of decline not seen since the 2011 financial crisis.\n\nThe MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 4.2%. Chinese blue chips, however, were relatively resilient, dipping only 0.5%, helped by a rise in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.\n\nJapanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply by 17 basis points to 0.788%, the lowest since April, as markets re-evaluated the likelihood of another rate hike from the Bank of Japan.\n\nU.S. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with United States 10-Year dropping to 3.767%, the lowest since mid-2023. United States 2-Year decreased to 3.818%, and the yield curve could soon invert, a pattern historically associated with recessions.\n\nThe weak July payrolls report has led markets to price in a 78% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September by a full 50 basis points. Futures suggest a total of 122 basis points in cuts for the year, with rates expected to be around 3.0% by the end of 2025.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note, adding that the risk is somewhat mitigated by the Fed's ability to ease policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street bank now anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December.\n\n\"The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks. If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September,” analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan was more pessimistic, assigning a 50% probability of a U.S. recession.\n\n\"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November,\" said the bank’s economists.\n\nThe significant drop in Treasury yields has overshadowed the U.S. dollar's typical safe-haven appeal, dragging the currency down 1.1% against a basket of major currencies. The dollar fell 2% against the yen to 143.10, while the euro dropped 1.9% to 156.35 yen. However, the euro held steady against the dollar at $1.0934.\n\nInvestors also increased bets that other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease policy more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now expected to cut rates by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nIn the commodity markets, gold traded relatively flat at $2,431.62.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmakers crushed on US recession concerns\n\nStocks trampled, Nikkei tumbles past Black Monday milestone\n\nEuropean stocks plunge on recession fears\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks I'm Buying On the Dip",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit a speed bump. On June 25, 2024, Goldman Sachs released a thought-provoking research report titled \"Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\" This analysis sent ripples through the tech sector, causing many AI-centric stocks to stumble.\n\nGoldman's report paints a sobering picture of AI's near-term economic impact. It suggests that building out AI infrastructure could cost a staggering $1 trillion. More concerningly, the report argues that AI's cost-saving potential may not justify this enormous price tag. It also raises concerns about looming energy constraints potentially limiting AI's ability to boost top-line growth outside the chipmaking industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors, already jittery from a slowing economy and geopolitical tensions, seemed to take these arguments to heart. The result? A significant pullback in many of the market's most prominent AI players.\n\nA buying opportunity\n\nWhile Goldman's analysis raises valid points, I believe it may be overly focused on short-term hurdles. AI isn't going to revolutionize the world overnight, but its transformative potential is undeniable. We're witnessing the early stages of a technological shift that will reshape industries, boost productivity, and create entirely new business models.\n\nConsider this: AI is currently in its infancy. The advances we'll see in the next two to three years will likely make today's AI look primitive by comparison. I'm convinced we're on the cusp of seeing the emergence of true \"killer apps\" -- AI-powered innovations that drive widespread adoption and showcase the technology's game-changing capabilities.\n\nMoreover, once AI becomes deeply integrated into popular ecosystems like Apple's, we'll likely see a quantum leap in public awareness and appreciation of AI's potential. This near-term event could trigger a new wave of investment and innovation across the tech sector.\n\nWith this long-term perspective in mind, I see the current dip in AI stocks as a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors. Two companies in particular stand out as attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the AI revolution: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nNvidia: The AI Powerhouse\n\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has seen its share price drop by nearly 15% since Goldman's report. This double-digit pullback presents an intriguing entry point for a company that's absolutely dominating the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the de facto standard for AI processing, powering everything from autonomous vehicles to large language models. The company's recent financial results underscore this fact. In fiscal 2024, Nvidia reported a staggering 126% year-over-year jump in revenue and an equally impressive gross margin of 73%.\n\nWhat excites me most about Nvidia, though, is its relentless innovation. Its next AI GPU, Blackwell, showcases the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of this game-changing tech. Given its outsize market share and focus on innovation, Nvidia is in a prime position to benefit from an AI-powered future.\n\nAmazon: AI woven into its DNA\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon has also felt the impact of Goldman's report, with its stock shedding 10% of its value. However, I see this as a chance to invest in a company that's integrating AI across its vast business empire.\n\nAmazon's AI strategy is multifaceted. In e-commerce, AI powers everything from product recommendations to inventory management and logistics optimization. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a comprehensive suite of AI and machine learning tools, enabling businesses of all sizes to harness the power of AI.\n\nWhile Amazon's recent growth hasn't been as explosive as Nvidia's, it's still noteworthy. Wall Street is expecting a 22% rise in sales over the course of 2024 and 2025 for the e-commerce titan. Consistent double-digit revenue growth is an impressive achievement, especially for a megacap company like Amazon.\n\nThe bottom line is that Amazon's massive data resources and cloud infrastructure give it a significant edge in developing and deploying AI solutions at scale.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nThe current market skepticism around AI, as reflected in Goldman's report, may be overlooking the technology's long-term transformative potential. Both Nvidia and Amazon are exceptionally well positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI revolution, regardless of short-term cost concerns or economic headwinds.\n\nNvidia's innovation engine and market dominance in AI chips make it a cornerstone of the AI ecosystem. Amazon's diverse AI strategy, spanning e-commerce, cloud services, and consumer devices, provides multiple avenues for growth and value creation. So, despite the ongoing volatility in these names, I plan to start buying them aggressively over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if you want exposure to this theme without buying individual stocks, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available that focus on AI and machine learning. Most of these ETFs own a significant number of Nvidia and Amazon shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $657,306!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Least Educated State in the US",
        "content": "This article looks at the least educated state in the US. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 20 Least Educated States in the US.\n\nFindings by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 observed a direct relationship between education levels and earnings, with income rising with higher attainment of education. Individuals with less than a high school diploma earned a mere $682 per week, compared to around $1,000 for those with an associate degree. On the other hand, persons holding a bachelor’s degree made $1,432 per week, followed by $1,661 for master’s or postgraduate degree holders, and over $2,000 per week for individuals with professional or doctoral qualifications.\n\nEducational Attainment in the United States\n\nThe United States is one of the most educated countries in the world, with 142 campuses ranked among the top 1,000 by QS Rankings, including three of the world’s top five universities being American. These include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and Stanford University. According to the US Census Bureau, 37.7% of the country’s population aged 25 and above had a bachelor’s degree or higher in 2022, up from 37.5% in 2020. On the other hand, 28% only had high school as their highest education level. During the 2022-2023 academic year, the US government spent an average of $17,495 per student, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nMassachusetts is the most educated state in America, with 46.6% of its population aged 25 years and above having at least a bachelor’s degree. Moreover, nearly two-thirds of its youth aged between 18 and 24 have completed some college or associate degree. Some other states widely acclaimed for their education include Vermont, Colorado, New Jersey, and Maryland. Education levels, however, do not remain even across the country, varying by region and even deteriorating in some states, which is the focus of this article.\n\nMaking Education More Accessible\n\nMany large corporations in the US actively strive to make education more accessible at a lower cost, both within the country and outside. One of them is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which provides a digital platform to several online education companies. In 2019, the company established Project Kuiper, a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband network, to provide internet connectivity to underserved regions.\n\nThe constellation is set to be launched during the fourth quarter of this year, under which Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be launching around 3,000 satellites into orbit. The project received the license for deployment from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2020, and there is great optimism about the project making online education affordable for millions of pupils around the world.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s TechSpark program has also been vital in providing residents in rural United States access to digital skills. As a result of this initiative, 88% of the schools in Northeast Wisconsin now offer computer science education, catering to the job market's needs. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also launched the Cybersecurity Readiness Program in Mississippi at Jackson State University, which offers cybersecurity experience to students.\n\nThe company, under its partnership with Mississippi, has another project in the state, called the CoBuilder Accelerator Program, which brings talented entrepreneurs together from across the state and provides them with necessary training for their ventures. Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Office 365 Education provides free access to students and teachers from various educational institutions to platforms such as Word, Excel, Teams, PowerPoint, and more. The Least Educated State in the US\n\nSyda Productions/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nFour weighted metrics were used to rank the least educated states in the US. These included the share of the population aged 25 and above that had a high school education or less as their highest qualification, the percentage of people aged 25 and above that held a bachelor’s degree or higher, the pupil-to-teacher ratio in the state, and expenditure per pupil in the state. The first two metrics were related to the level of education and had a combined weightage of 90%, while the other two were concerning the quality of education in each state and had a weight of 10% in our overall analysis.\n\nData related to the level of education was sourced from the United States Census Bureau and is for the year 2022. For quality of education, we referred to Insider Monkey’s recent articles on the 20 Worst States for Education in the US and the 20 Best States for Education in the US. We observed where each state ranked on a particular metric and assigned it a weighted score. Finally, all weighted scores were aggregated to get an overall score. The 20 least educated states in the US are listed in descending order of their weighted scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe least educated state in the US is West Virginia.\n\n1. West Virginia\n\nPopulation aged 25 and above with high school or less: 49.1%\n\nPopulation aged 25 and above with a bachelor’s degree or higher: 24.8%\n\nPupil-to-Teacher Ratio: 13.5\n\nExpenditure per Pupil: $16,214\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 0.082\n\nWest Virginia is the least educated state in America with nearly half of its adult population aged 25 and above having only a high school diploma or less as their education. Higher education attainment also remains extremely low in the state. Only 15% of the population in this age group has a bachelor’s degree, compared to the national average of 23%. The share of people holding an advanced professional or postgraduate degree is 9.8%, below the national average of 14%.\n\nTo learn about other least-educated states, you can check out our detailed report 20 Least Educated States in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the education level of states to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) is one of the three major performance-tracking indexes in the U.S. stock market, alongside the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Unlike its two peers, however, the Dow Jones is a much smaller index, tracking just 30 of America's largest companies. These companies come from most major sectors, except separately tracked areas such as utilities and real estate.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dow Jones has lagged behind the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite in the past decade. The good news, though, is that many of the companies within the index still are great investments on their own. ^IXIC Chart\n\nInvestors looking to add high-quality companies to their portfolio should consider the following two Dow Jones stocks, which have the ability to soar this year and beyond.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be almost synonymous with e-commerce at this point, but its business has expanded impressively over the years. The modest online bookstore has become a true big tech giant with its hands in many pots.\n\nAmazon has been able to fund its research and development and enter into new industries because of the cash flow its e-commerce business generates. In the first quarter, net sales from its North American and international segments were a combined $118.2 billion. That's more than Target generated in its last four quarters combined.\n\nAdd in the revenue from its successful cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Amazon brought in more revenue in the first quarter than Meta Platforms' last four quarters combined. The only company that tops Amazon's revenue is Walmart. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nRevenue is great, but you could argue that profit is even better, and that's where AWS comes into the picture.\n\nCloud services are a much more profitable business than e-commerce because many of the costs are fixed, and once a platform reaches a certain size, it benefits from the economics of scale. This seems to be the case for AWS, the world's most-used cloud platform and undisputed market leader with a 31% market share (Microsoft Azure is second with 25%).\n\nAs Amazon adds artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to AWS and continues to be a platform where companies can create their own generative AI and machine learning models, it should hold its top spot for quite some time, though Azure has been gaining ground.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is around 3.28, which sits below its five-year average. That isn't necessarily \"cheap,\" but long-term investors can justify it, considering Amazon's potential growth areas.\n\nStory continues AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\n2. Apple\n\nAfter spending much of the past year away from the top spot, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has regained its title as the world's most valuable public company. While many top tech companies have seen huge stock price surges fueled by AI hype, Apple was noticeably exempt. In the past 12 months, it has underperformed the S&P 500.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple's finances are tied to the success of its iPhone sales, and that's been a thorn in its side recently, as global smartphone sales have slumped over the past few years. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite the seemingly stagnant past couple of years, there's light at the end of the tunnel. To begin, global smartphone sales are projected to rebound this year, which comes at a great time as Apple introduces its Apple Intelligence features in its next generation of hardware.\n\nThe second encouraging sign is the growth of Apple's services segment, which set a revenue record in the first quarter, generating close to $23.9 billion. Services offer higher margins than hardware products as well as provide more reliable revenue because a lot of it is subscription-based.\n\nServices may never overtake hardware as Apple's cash cow, but they're becoming a great complement to the ecosystem that many Apple loyalists (myself included) find themselves in. As Apple enters industries like financials and health, it can create deeper integration for its users. That's a recipe for longevity.\n\nApple has proven time and time again that it's one of the best-run companies in the world (thanks to CEO Tim Cook). Like most businesses, it hit a rough patch, but there are few companies that I'd bet on long-term before Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why now is the time to buy the Nvidia sell-off",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) “relief rally” on Wednesday was short-lived. The stock hit its lowest level since May, falling as much as 7% on Friday and wiping out its gains from earlier in the week amid a broader unraveling across the tech sector.\n\nThe Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory, driven not only by signs of a slowing economy but also by fears that a handful of tech’s biggest players are overspending on AI.\n\nBut that latter factor — a pledge to invest more in AI — should be viewed as a “catalyst” for Nvidia and other AI chipmakers.\n\nWall Street pros were quick to tell Yahoo Finance this week that the AI trade is far from over, and the recent pullback should be viewed as a chance to scoop up shares. While the Big Tech companies are struggling to show the fruits of their AI labor, they're still committed to spending on chips for the long term.\n\n“It's a good buying opportunity given the prospects of the broader market,” Winthrop Capital Management’s Luke Stone told me following Nvidia competitor AMD’s (AMD) strong revenue forecast.\n\n“You’re seeing this delineation between the chip manufacturers and their customers, who have to invest more and more into the product and are really struggling,” Winthrop added.\n\nJust this past quarter, Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) posted more than $40 billion in expenditures. Amazon (AMZN) totaled $30 billion in spending during the first six months of the year and plans to spend even more in the second half. All have said the majority of that money is going toward AI.\n\nThat’s not what the market wanted to hear. Shares of Amazon and Microsoft closed the week lower, similar to the drop in Alphabet shares last week, as investors made it clear the AI trade has turned into a show-me story.\n\nBut what’s worrisome for hyperscalers is good news for Nvidia and its peers.\n\n“We've continued to see the [capital expenditures] guides actually go up materially and that's really what's important,” Bernstein managing director Stacy Rasgon told me. “People worry about sustainability but it looks like that spend, at least for now, is sustaining.”\n\nAnd that’s set to boost Nvidia’s top line, as Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue.\n\n“Fear that the revenue trajectory won’t be there over the next 12 months or so is now starting to ease,” CFRA’s Angelo Zino explained to me. “We think Nvidia is going to post some great results, and that is going to be a catalyst for the space.”\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this week, Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore argued the sell-off in Nvidia presents a “good entry point” and moved the chipmaker back to its \"Top Pick.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our perception is that the market is taking a very glass half-empty view of some of the hyperscale comments, where there is a clear desire on the part of customers to continue to commit resources to developing multi modal generative AI,” Moore wrote.\n\nSynovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan likened the opportunity to invest in Nvidia and other AI infrastructure stocks to suppliers who thrived during the gold rush. “Would you rather be the person who's digging gold or would you rather be the person that's selling the equipment to dig for gold?” he said.\n\nNvidia closed the week off 5% and down roughly 26% from its record closing high.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "The major stock indexes continued to new highs this year, led by the growth-centric Nasdaq Composite, which is up 22.5% over the last 12 months. While Wall Street continues to worry about the health of the consumer amid rising interest rates, history suggests that now is still a great time to be investing in stocks.\n\nOver the last 92 years, there have been an equal number of bull and bear markets. But the average bull market has lasted almost five years on average, according to Stifel, compared to 1.5 years for the average bear market. This means investors could be looking at another three years of positive returns before the next major hiccup in the stock market.\n\nWho better to look to for relatively safe stocks that can grow your savings than billionaire Warren Buffett? From 1965 through 2023, his investing skills delivered a massive 4,384,748% return for Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) shareholders.\n\nLet's look at three Buffett-approved stocks that are surefire bets in the current bull market.\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nThe first stock to buy is none other than Buffett's largest personal investment -- Berkshire Hathaway. At the end of 2023, Buffett held 38% of Berkshire's class A shares -- an investment that would be worth $143 billion at recent share prices, ranking him No. 6 on the Forbes list of billionaires.\n\nBuffett made his first millions managing money for his partners through Buffett Partnership in the 1960s. One of his big bets during those years was a struggling textile mill in Massachusetts that was trading at a bargain price. Buffett acquired a controlling interest in the stock, and over the ensuing decades as CEO, remade it into an investment vehicle to scoop up quality businesses (and stocks) at fair prices.\n\nToday, Berkshire owns dozens of businesses in consumer goods, utilities, energy, and insurance. These businesses generated an operating profit of $37 billion in 2023, up from $31 billion in 2022.\n\nNow is a good time to buy the stock, since Berkshire's businesses generally do well in a bull market, which usually coincides with a growing economy.\n\nMost importantly, Berkshire has spent billions repurchasing its own shares through the first quarter, which means Buffett sees value in the stock.\n\n2. American Express\n\nShares of American Express(NYSE: AXP) have surged to new highs this year. The stock is up 50% over the last year, supported by strong card member spending and revenue growth. The ability of this 174-year-old company to keep finding ways to grow speaks volumes about why Berkshire Hathaway has held a stake in it for more than 30 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA top credit card company like Amex is obviously dependent on growth in consumer spending. This benefits American Express when the economy is growing, but the stock can fall when there's a recession and lower growth in card member spending. But that's why now is a good time to consider starting a position.\n\nIn the second quarter, revenue increased by 9% year over year (excluding currency changes), with adjusted earnings per share up 21%. The company saw balanced growth in U.S. consumer billings across goods and services as well as in travel and entertainment. Importantly, most of this growth was driven by Millennials and Gen Z, which reflects how effective the company has been in marketing its brand and membership perks to a new generation of customers.\n\nThis is a solid business that can keep growing for many years, since American Express card members spend more, on average, than users of other credit card brands. This incentivizes merchants to pay Amex fees for the privilege of accepting its cards at checkout. Wall Street analysts expect earnings to grow 15% annually in the coming years, which could potentially double the share price within five years.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has held a stake in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) since 2019. It was likely bought by one of Buffett's investing deputies, but Amazon displays all the characteristics that Buffett himself would look for in an investment.\n\nAmazon probably has the strongest retail brand in North America. It surpassed Walmart in U.S. apparel sales in 2021, but Amazon is increasingly focusing on expanding its brand presence in international markets.\n\nAmazon's Prime Day has become a major annual shopping event in the U.S., and the company is applying the same strategy to win customers in Europe and the Middle East. In the first quarter, Amazon finally showed an international operating profit of $903 million, reversing a string of losses. Amazon's increasingly profitable business could send the stock to new highs.\n\nAmazon's long-term bet on international markets is finally starting to pay off, which signals plenty of growth ahead in a multitrillion-dollar global e-commerce market.\n\nOf course, Amazon also has growing revenue streams from cloud services and advertising that are padding the company's bottom line. Wall Street analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 23% over the next several years, which should lead to outstanding returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Fears over the economy are set to remain to the fore amid worries that the Federal Reserve may have left interest rates elevated for too long, allowing them to hurt growth. More high-profile earnings reports are due and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid a combination of recession fears and geopolitical risks. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nU.S. data, Fed speakers\n\nAfter Friday’s weak July jobs report stoked fears over the prospect of a recession the economic calendar for the week ahead is considerably lighter.\n\nThe Institute of Supply Management releases its service sector index on Monday which is expected to point to modest growth.\n\nInvestors will get a fresh update on the state of the labor market on Thursday, with the weekly report on initial jobless claims, which are expected to pull back just slightly from an almost one-year high.\n\nInvestors will also get a chance to hear from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin after the central bank kept rates on hold last week, but left the door open for a September rate cut.\n\nMore earnings\n\nWhile most of the mega cap companies have already reported some high-profile earnings results are expected in the coming days.\n\nResults from industrial bellwether Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and media and entertainment giant Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) will give more insight into the health of manufacturing and the consumer. Also reporting are healthcare heavyweights, including weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), which is at the center of the market's artificial intelligence excitement.\n\nU.S. stocks sold off for a second day on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory as indications that the economy is slowing stoked fears that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure was a drop in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after quarterly results and disappointing forecasts.\n\nChina outlook\n\nInvestors will get an update on how the economic recovery in China is shaping up in the second half of the year with a slew of economic releases this week.\n\nThe week begins with a private-sector survey on services activity, followed by trade data on Wednesday and a reading on consumer prices at the end of the week.\n\nRecent data has pointed to a gloomy outlook for the world’s number two economy, and recent surprise rate cuts have reflected a growing sense of urgency in Beijing's efforts to shore up growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficials will be keeping an especially close eye on Friday's inflation number for clues on how much more needs to be done to boost lackluster domestic demand.\n\nReserve Bank of Australia decision\n\nThe RBA is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its upcoming policy meeting on Tuesday after data last month showed that core inflation unexpectedly slowed to a two-year low in the second quarter and the rate of economic growth moderated in the first quarter.\n\nMarket participants will be focusing on the central banks forward guidance with markets pricing in a 70% probability of an easing in interest rates by the end of the year should inflation continue to slow.\n\nOil prices\n\nOil prices fell on Friday, settling at their lowest since January as weak economic data out of the U.S. and top oil importer China raised worries over the demand outlook.\n\nThe soft U.S. jobs report coupled with weakening manufacturing activity in China sent prices lower on the risk that a sluggish global economic recovery would weigh on oil consumption.\n\nOil investors are also watching the Middle East, where Lebanon's Iran-backed group Hezbollah said its conflict with Israel had entered a new phase.\n\nMeanwhile, an OPEC+ meeting last Thursday left the group's oil output policy unchanged, including a plan to start unwinding one layer of production cuts from October.\n\n--Reuters contributed to this report\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nBoE rate cut adds to sense of turnaround in sluggish UK economy\n\nFed's Barkin tells PBS program he won't prejudge what to do at next meeting\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why is earnings season the perfect time to make your move?\n\nEarnings announcements lead to market volatility. So, this allows investors to bag top-quality stocks at a discount. The ongoing mixed earnings season has led to a dip in several stocks. And, while it could be a temporary reaction, it can allow you to load up your portfolio. Now is the time to start looking for long-term stocks to buy on dip.\n\nRemember that temporary market volatility is just that, temporary. It could be an immediate reaction to the numbers or the guidance and will cool down in the long term. Some of the blue-chip stocks have seen a dip after the recent results announcement.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s dive into the seven long-term stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple reasons to add Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to your portfolio but one of the biggest reasons is the dip in the stock after the results. The company missed revenue expectations and reported a lower guidance which led to a disappointment in the market.\n\nAmazon reported a revenue of $147.98 billion and an EPS of $1.26. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue stood at $26.3 billion while the advertising revenue missed expectations and came in at $12.8 billion.\n\nThe management added that consumers have become cost-conscious and are choosing cheaper products which will lead to a dip in revenue in the third quarter. The weaker-than-expected guidance impacted the stock which is down 7% over the past month and is exchanging hands for $166.24, much lower than the 52-week high of $201.\n\nAmazon’s long-term picture looks attractive and it continues to hold a large market share in the cloud computing segment. AMZN will bounce back as consumer spending improves, so plan to buy and hold for the next five years.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) doesn’t need any introduction since the brand is a popular name in the sports industry. The legacy business has had a tough year with its stock down 30% year-to-date (YTD). This dip is due to a drop in sales, but I believe Nike has the power to bounce back.\n\nThe company’s fiscal 2024 results saw a modest 1% year-over-year (YOY) rise in sales and generated $51.4 billion in revenue. Its management is aware of the lackluster sales and is planning a comeback. It has increased the marketing and advertising budget by 6% and is looking to benefit from the Paris Olympics as a catalyst. Thus, Nike has worked on an ad campaign around it.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at $73, the stock has steadily dropped since January and is much lower than the 52-week high of $123. This is a long-term buy and hold in the dip. I am certain Nike has the potential to make a comeback and is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 2%.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline lodging marketplace, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) hasn’t had a good year so far despite a strong start. ABNB stock is down 7% in the past six months and is trading for $127.88 as of this writing. Rising competition and the growing housing inventory have caused trouble for the business. However, its fundamentals are strong.\n\nIn the first quarter, it saw a 17% YOY jump in the active listings, and it started to expand into less popular markets. It saw impressive growth in the gross nights booked, and the total revenue jumped 18% YOY. The company had the most profitable first-quarter ever but it didn’t reflect on the stock price.\n\nAirbnb is set to report results next week, and a weaker guidance could lead to a dip in the stock. I believe Airbnb is a solid business and an ideal long-term player. Despite competition, the company has the potential to dominate the market and has performed exceptionally well over the past year. The pent-up travel demand and ongoing summer holidays could boost the company’s financials.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nWhen McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is lagging in the market, you do not need to worry about the company. Instead, you need to start worrying about the economy. MCD has understood that higher costs are no longer going to work and with cost-conscious consumers, McDonald’s will have to derive a plan to bounce back.\n\nThe company has launched the $5 adult happy meal which has been a success and is being extended. However, the recent quarterly results were disappointing. It missed earnings and revenue estimates. The company saw a revenue of $6.49 billion and an EPS of $2.97, the revenue was flat YOY. Also, it saw a dip in same-store sales.\n\nThis isn’t something that happens with McDonald’s often, but the inflation has hurt its business. The stock is down 9% over the past six months and is exchanging hands for $268. I am certain McDonald’s will see better days as consumer spending improves, until then you can enjoy the dividend yield of 2.49%. It continues to remain a tasty restaurant stock for the long term.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest competitor and a strong player in the artificial intelligence race, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is making every attempt to win the market.\n\nThe company reported impressive numbers for the second quarter with a revenue of $5.8 billion and earnings per share of $0.69. The revenue saw a 9% YOY jump while it swung from an operating loss a year ago to an operating profit in the second quarter. AMD saw a record growth in the data center revenue with a jump of 115% YOY.\n\nDespite the strong fundamentals, AMD stock hasn’t been able to soar higher. It is exchanging hands for $133 and is down 25% in the past six months. AMD’s achievements may not look as bright if compared with Nvidia. But if you look at the company independently and the progress it has made, AMD does shine amongst the competitors. The dip is a chance to buy this AI stock.\n\nThe management has raised the full-year revenue guidance for the AI data center GPUs to $4.5 billion, driven by the rapid adoption of its MI300 series GPUs.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) Silhouette of person holding mobile phone with SoFi (SOFI) logo shown in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nFintech company  SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) has done everything right. Yet, the stock hasn’t been able to hit double-digits since the start of 2024. Trading at $6.73, SOFI stock has dropped 25% YTD. It recently reported stellar fundamentals and saw significant growth in its user base. Its revenue came in at $599 million and saw a 41% jump in members.\n\nI have been recommending SOFI stock for a while now but many are worried about the future of the company after a rate cut. SoFi Technologies has established itself as a very strong financial institution which doesn’t rely on a single segment for revenue.\n\nThe diversified business will keep the revenue steady in the coming quarters. SoFi Technologies has started to rely less on lending and is pivoting towards financial services products which now comprise 45% of the company’s revenue.\n\nDespite the fantastic results, the stock price did not budge. However, I think it is a sign that you should load up on this fintech. It could double your money in the next two years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) can be an excellent addition to your investment portfolio. The company holds the largest AI chip market share and is benefitting from the imbalance between the demand and supply of chips. Set to report results next month, Nvidia will be sharing how its clients profit from their AI chips.\n\nDespite the competition, Nvidia has remained a tech industry leader, and I strongly believe its dominance will continue throughout the year. The stock has become affordable after the recent stock split. But it is down 10% over the past month due to the tech industry pullback.\n\nWhile it has nothing to do with Nvidia or its fundamentals, the pullback is a chance to pounce. NVDA will report impressive numbers and beat expectations with revenue exceeding $28 billion. This could give the stock a good reason to rally. Long-term investors who held on to Nvidia have already taken home solid profits. This tech stock wouldn’t disappoint.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)?",
        "content": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$200 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$168. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amazon.com's current trading price of US$168 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Amazon.com’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nIs Amazon.com Still Cheap?\n\nAccording to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 39.65x is currently well-above the industry average of 16.19x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Amazon.com’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Amazon.com generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 99% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? AMZN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe AMZN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AMZN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThroughout this earnings season, investors have been especially focused on Big Tech’s capital expenditures.\n\nThis spending is seen as a barometer for how bullish Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are about what AI will do for them. Though, as Julie Hyman wrote Thursday, it’s a little more complicated than that, since they must go all in to even get a seat at the table.\n\nBut the nature of supply chain dynamics means that what gathers and melts in the mountains pours into the rivers and lakes.\n\nAnd as our Chart of the Week shows, Big Tech is still making it rain. And Nvidia is the lake.\n\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg, coupled with quarterly reports, more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from some familiar names among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks — Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nThe biggest transfer is from Microsoft, with spending from the world’s most valuable company accounting for 19% of Nvidia’s revenue. This makes the company its biggest customer by far, nearly doubling Meta’s spend and tripling that of Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAnd on the Microsoft side, Bloomberg’s data shows Nvidia accounts for 45% of its capital expenditures, whereas the chipmaker only gets 15% of Alphabet’s outlays, for example.\n\nIn the AI jungle, this data is a reminder that the chipmakers eat first, long before the hyperscalers can offer much more than hints to investors about when the AI investments will turn into AI revenue streams.\n\nStill, this is one of the key charts that have helped power the market, especially through the tech earnings season.\n\nFor now, the lack of revenue isn’t too worrying to investors — though doubts are rising! — as it’s still hard to imagine the trillion-dollar Microsoft doesn’t know something they don’t about the opportunity.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "Decoding Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Amazon's robust financial performance showcases significant growth in net income and comprehensive income. Technological advancements and international expansion present both opportunities and challenges. Legal proceedings and intense competition underline potential threats to Amazon's market position. Amazon's commitment to innovation and customer service remains a key strength.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMZN.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the global e-commerce and cloud computing giant, released its 10-Q filing on August 2, 2024, revealing a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. The filing indicates a robust financial performance, with net income nearly doubling from $6,750 million in Q2 2023 to $13,485 million in Q2 2024. This growth is also reflected in the six-month comparison, with net income rising from $9,922 million to $23,916 million. Comprehensive income followed a similar trend, although it faced a slight decrease in other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments. These financials set the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with insights into Amazon's strategic direction and market dynamics. Decoding Amazon.com Inc (AMZN): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nFinancial Resilience and Market Leadership: Amazon's financial performance is a testament to its resilience and market leadership. The company's net income surge from $6,750 million to $13,485 million in the second quarter of 2024, coupled with a comprehensive income increase to $22,963 million for the first half of the year, underscores its strong profitability and operational efficiency. This financial strength enables Amazon to invest in new technologies, market expansion, and customer service enhancements, further solidifying its position as a leading online retailer and cloud service provider.\n\nInnovative Technology and Infrastructure: Amazon's commitment to innovation is evident in its technology and infrastructure investments. The company's focus on research and development has led to the creation of cutting-edge products and services, such as AWS, which continues to dominate the cloud computing space. Amazon's technological advancements not only drive internal efficiencies but also provide a competitive edge in attracting and retaining customers through improved offerings and user experiences.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependency on Third-Party Sellers: While Amazon's marketplace model has been a significant growth driver, it also presents a weakness. The reliance on third-party sellers exposes the company to risks associated with seller misconduct, such as counterfeit goods and fraudulent activities. These issues can damage Amazon's reputation and lead to legal challenges, as indicated by the various legal proceedings mentioned in the filing. Managing this dependency and ensuring a trustworthy platform is crucial for maintaining customer confidence and brand integrity.\n\nStory continues\n\nInternational Expansion Challenges: Amazon's aggressive international expansion strategy, while a source of growth, also introduces complexities and risks. The company faces intense competition, regulatory hurdles, and cultural differences in new markets, which can hinder profitability and operational effectiveness. As Amazon continues to navigate these challenges, it must adapt its business model to local market conditions and regulatory environments to ensure sustained success abroad.\n\nOpportunities\n\nGlobal Market Penetration: Amazon's international sales, which constitute a significant portion of its revenue, present an opportunity for further market penetration. By leveraging its brand and technological prowess, Amazon can expand its presence in emerging markets, where e-commerce adoption is still growing. Tailoring its offerings to local preferences and investing in regional infrastructure can drive increased market share and revenue growth in these high-potential areas.\n\nTechnological Advancements: The continuous evolution of technology offers Amazon opportunities to enhance its service offerings and customer experience. Innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and logistics can improve operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, Amazon can maintain its competitive advantage and attract a broader customer base.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: Amazon operates in highly competitive markets, facing rivals with substantial resources and established market positions. As competitors innovate and adapt, Amazon must continuously invest in its platform, technology, and marketing to retain its market share. The intense competition also puts pressure on pricing and margins, which can impact Amazon's profitability and growth prospects.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: Amazon's diverse operations expose it to various regulatory and legal risks. The filing highlights ongoing legal proceedings that could result in significant financial penalties and reputational harm. Additionally, changes in tax laws, data privacy regulations, and antitrust scrutiny can affect Amazon's business practices and financial performance. Proactively managing these risks and engaging with policymakers is essential for Amazon's long-term success.\n\nIn conclusion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) demonstrates a strong financial foundation and a commitment to innovation that positions it well for future growth. However, the company must navigate the complexities of international expansion, manage its reliance on third-party sellers, and address the competitive and regulatory landscape. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Amazon can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats, ensuring its continued leadership in the e-commerce and cloud computing sectors.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Shoppers hate retailers’ anti-theft measures—and Amazon is reaping the rewards",
        "content": "As retailers crack down on in-store theft, Amazon has emerged an unlikely victor. Tired of navigating locked-up cases filled with essentials, shoppers are looking for ease—and finding it on Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy said.\n\n“It's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you, and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores,” he said during the company’s earnings call late Thursday. “So the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our [expanded Amazon Pharmacy] experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior.”\n\nJassy did not provide sales data for the company’s pharmacy platform but said there's “a lot of growth there.” Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThough Amazon Pharmacy is a small slice of the company’s online platform, the comments highlight Amazon’s effort’s to decrease friction—implementing technologies to make shopping easier while simultaneously mitigating retail shrink, or inventory loss—amid growing frustration over anti-theft measures.\n\nAnti-theft technologies have already dissuaded consumers from shopping at certain retailers. Joe Budano, CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme, told Axios that frustration with locked-up goods and other shoplifting deterrents can lead to sales decreases of 15% to 25%.\n\nThe increase in anti-theft measures has emerged along with grievances from retail CEOs on the prevalence of shoplifting, which they said could lead to store closures and higher prices. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in December 2022, “Theft is an issue. It’s higher than what it has historically been.”\n\nIronically, some of the products stolen from brick-and-mortar retailers have found their way to online platforms like Amazon for resale. Amazon said in a June blog post it’s invested in and “leverages sophisticated detection and prevention solutions across our stores” to combat the sale of stolen items.\n\nFeeding consumer resentment\n\nAs retailers introduce additional technology to reduce retail theft, experts are conflicted on the actual scope of the problem. Data about the prevalence and impact of retail theft is mixed: The Council on Criminal Justice’s 2023 shoplifting report, which used data from the first half of the year, found that shoplifting surged 16% from the first half of 2019.\n\nYet shoplifting was down in 17 of 24 U.S. cities where data was collected. And after New York was removed as an outlier, rates in the first half of 2023 were lower than the same period in 2019. It’s led retail experts to say that the threat of shoplifting to retailers’ bottom lines has been blown out of proportion.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, trying to prevent shoplifting has become its own threat to retailers. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, told Bloomberg that as long as retailers continue the practice of locking up items, it jeopardizes an advantage of brick-and-mortar stores, namely their ability to help develop closer relationships with consumers.\n\nFor the consumer, it means retail therapy has turned into a retail nightmare. Some shoppers have been outspoken about not only the scope of the problem in their own shopping experiences, but also about how it's driven to them online shopping instead.\n\n“I recognize there is a reason why those things have been put in place, but it just makes me not want to patronize that store,” a Philadelphia business owner, who visits stores in-person to compare products, told the Inquirer. “If I’m going to lose that experience anyway, I’m just going to shop online.”\n\nOne Los Angeles Target shopper recalled waiting 15 minutes for a store worker to unlock a shelf case. She’s increasingly looked for essentials on Amazon.\n\n“Rather than go to Target and wait,” she told the Los Angeles Times, “I’ll just give Daddy Bezos my hard-earned cash.”\n\nTarget didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here’s Why Analysts are Upgrading Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings.Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of “demand cracks.” He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\n\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more “attractive.”\n\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\n\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\n\nThill thinks the AI “payoff” time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\n\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nJeff Bezos of Amazon\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nBMO Capital recently upgraded Amazon shares and the company’s Cloud estimates. The firm expects Amazon Web Services to grow revenue 19% to hit $26.3 billion. BMO increased its price target for AMZN to $230 from $220 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target.  The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an “inflection point” with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Jim Cramer: ‘People are Fleeing’ from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the “best fundamentals” got “hammered once again.”\n\n“I did not expect that to happen.”\n\nCramer said that sometimes it’s difficult to own the “winners.” The CNBC host said it’s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what “you are up against.”\n\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a “periodic selloff” that presented an “opportunity.”\n\n“When we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there’s something wrong or because they are up huge.”\n\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\n\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has “changed.”\n\n“From what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.”\n\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies’ fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Falling Stock Amid Latest Market Rotation?\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that people are selling Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) because it seels 40 times earnings, which is “unusually high, even for Amazon.”\n\n“It’s not a huge beneficiary from lower interest rates so people are fleeing from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and buying cyclical plays.”\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target.  The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an “inflection point” with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world’s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon’s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon’s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Best Passive Income Idea for Young Adults",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 passive income ideas for young adultsand in this article, we will talk about the best passive income idea for young adults.\n\nThe rise of passive income streams has become an important global trend in recent years. According to a 2024 Bankrate survey, over one-third (36%) of US adults earn extra money through side hustles. This phenomenon is particularly common among younger generations as 48% of Gen Z and 44% of Millennials engage in side hustles. On average, side hustlers make $891 per month in 2024.\n\nDespite inflation cooling, many Americans still find it challenging to sustain their lifestyles on a single income. More than a quarter of side hustlers (28%) earn over $500 monthly from their side gigs, indicating the important role these additional jobs play in financial stability. Interestingly, the gender gap persists, with men earning an average of $1,034 per month from side hustles compared to $735 for women.\n\nThe trend towards side hustles also confirms a shift in financial planning and lifestyle. A huge portion of side hustlers (52%) have started their additional jobs in the past two years. Moreover, nearly one-third (32%) believe they will always need a side hustle to make ends meet.\n\nHow to Passively Make $2000 a month with Amazon.com, Inc and Etsy, Inc?\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides several avenues for generating passive income by capitalizing on its vast ecommerce infrastructure. First, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Affiliate Program enables individuals to earn commissions by promoting products. By joining the Amazon Associates program, users can generate affiliate links to share on websites, blogs, or social media. When someone purchases through these links, the affiliate earns a percentage of the sale, typically between 1% and 10%, depending on the product category. Creating high-quality content to drive traffic and conversions is essential for success, as the program requires a minimum of 3 sales within 180 days to maintain the account.\n\nMoreover, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program allows users to sell products without handling storage or shipping. Sellers identify high-demand products, source them from suppliers, and send them to Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s fulfillment centers. Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) then handles storage, packaging, and shipping. This model is quite popular because it eliminates the need for large inventory storage. In 2023, over 60% of Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s third-party sellers used FBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Audible offers another passive income stream. By joining the Amazon Audible affiliate program, users can earn $10 for each new Audible membership they drive through their unique links.\n\nOn the other hand, generating passive income on Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) can be achieved through digital products, which require minimal ongoing effort. For instance, one can create a collection of high-quality prints and list them on Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY). Customers purchase and download these prints which allows one to earn money repeatedly from a single creation. With Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY)’s large customer base, one could potentially earn $500 per week from selling just 50 prints at $10 each.\n\nDoes Passive Income Mean Effortless Income?\n\nIn the United States, passive income is often misunderstood. According to Census Bureau data, only 20% of American households earn passive income, with a median annual amount of $4,200. This income typically comes from dividends, interest, or rental properties. Despite the perception that passive income is effortless, many find it requires a high initial investment and ongoing effort, as seen in examples like rental property management or creating online courses.\n\nA common misconception is that passive income is easy money. For instance, online stores or rental properties might seem like low-effort ventures but often demand substantial time and financial resources. As observed with Luca Alboretti's experience, setting up an online store cost him $5,000 and countless hours, yet he only earned $300 in sales after a year. This explains that what is labelled as passive income often involves a considerable level of active work. The Best Passive Income Idea for Young Adults\n\nA young couple discussing their long-term investments over coffee in a modern cafe.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best passive income ideas for young adults, we essentially tried to target methods which were either a) simple b) involved minimal to no initial investment or c) were accessible to a large number of people. Thus, after identifying 30 such ways, we shortlisted 20 on the basis of consensus score for their friendliness for beginners gauged through our internet research. We have scored each idea out of 60 and a higher score indicates a higher level of simplicity and ease for the young. The list is presented in ascending order.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nOur Methodology Shows Affiliate Marketing is the Best Passive Income Idea for Young Adults\n\nTo list the best passive income ideas for young adults, we essentially tried to target ideas and avenues which were either a) simple b) involved minimal to no initial investment or c) were accessible to a large number of people. Thus, after identifying 30 such ways, we shortlisted 20 on the basis of consensus score for their friendliness for beginners gauged through our internet research. We have scored each idea out of 60 and a higher score indicates a higher level of simplicity and ease for the young. Our methodology revealed that affiliate marketing is indeed the best passive income idea for young adults in 2024.\n\nThe rise in the popularity of affiliate marketing can be attributed to the low barrier of entry and the potential for high earnings without the need for a high upfront investment. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, which are predominantly used by younger demographics, offer ideal environments for affiliate marketing with their visual and engaging formats. The trend shows that 85% of weekly Pinterest users and 52% of customers are more likely to purchase a product featured in a YouTube product review video.\n\nOnce an affiliate link is shared on a platform, it can generate sales and commissions without continuous effort. This is particularly attractive for students and young professionals that are trying to supplement their income without interfering with their primary responsibilities. For instance, Instagram users with under 10,000 followers have seen a 35% increase in story reach rates which confirms that even those with smaller audiences can achieve significant engagement and earnings. All of these factors collectively explain why affiliate marketing is the best passive income idea for young adults.\n\nTo check out the extensive list of the passive income ideas for young adults, please visit 20 passive income ideas for young adults.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation and 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Passive Income Ideas for Young Adults is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The growth and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is in something of a significant correction at the moment.\n\nAfter hitting new all-time highs early in July, the benchmark Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) has already pulled back close to 10% from its recent peak.\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Several key tech leaders, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), posted disappointing earnings results. The momentum has turned to the downside in the all-important semiconductor sector. And investors appear to be worried about recent geopolitical developments, which could augur poorly for economic growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the overall index finds itself on shaky footing heading into this fall, there are Nasdaq stocks performing well under the surface with further upside ahead. These are three of the Nasdaq stocks to watch.\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) PayPal (PYPL) logo\n\nMany investors have written off PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL). PYPL stock collapsed over the past two years as the e-commerce-driven boom seemingly turned into a bust. With momentum in the space drying up, PayPal shares lost as much as 80% of their peak valuation.\n\nIn theory, the slowing adoption of digital shopping and services, combined with high levels of competition in the fintech space, could have crushed PayPal. But the underlying business is still humming along. It grew revenues from $25.3 billion in 2021 to $27.5 billion in 2022 and $29.8 billion in 2023.\n\nThis year is set to be another record-maker, with revenues forecast to rise more than 7% overall to about $32 billion. The company’s most recent earnings result easily topped expectations, with revenues jumping 8%, powered by 11% growth in total payments volume.\n\nPayPal is buying back stock aggressively at its current low prices, which should generate substantial shareholder value over time. The stock is still on offer at less than 15 times forward earnings today.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the giants in the payroll processing and human resources management space.\n\nThe company recently topped the $100 billion market capitalization threshold and appears likely to surpass its all-time high stock price — set back in 2022 — in the near future.\n\nDespite uncertainty in other parts of the economy, employment remains quite strong, which powers demand for ADP’s services.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing recently delivered earnings well above expectations while laying out upbeat fiscal year 2025 guidance, which includes an estimate for 9% earnings growth. All this to say that while other parts of the Nasdaq ecosystem are suffering from slowdown worries at the moment, this employment services giant should keep steadily rolling along to new heights.\n\nStory continues\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe beleaguered Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) may be set for a comeback.\n\nThe company rose to prominence a decade ago with its blockbuster drugs that cure the hepatitis C virus. While the company initially faced controversy for its highly-priced cure, it counterintuitively left Gilead in a challenging spot. The company brought in record profits as it sold a great deal of this product. But, as the patient population rapidly decreased in size, Gilead’s revenues subsequently collapsed.\n\nGilead was left with tons of cash from that product cycle and has been looking for the next big opportunity. That appears to be in oncology, where Gilead has made several key acquisitions in recent years. Its cancer drugs also pair well with the company’s continuing leadership in the HIV treatments space.\n\nGILD stock has rallied after recent upbeat earnings as its turnaround gains momentum. Even so, Morningstar’s Karen Andersen believes shares remain at a more than 20% discount to fair value today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in GILD stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nIan Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

More alarmingly, the unemployment rate increased from 4.1% to 4.3%.\n\nAs a result, market-implied probabilities over a 50-basis-point cut in September have spiked to 73%, according to CME Group FedWatch tool.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has entered a correction phase after surpassing a 10% drawdown since its July peak. Mega-cap, high-quality tech stocks offered no refuge to investors, as the Magnificent Seven giants all suffered losses except for Apple Inc., buoyed by an upbeat earnings report. Collectively, the Magnificent Seven lost over $300 billion in market value on Friday alone.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), popularly known as the market’s fear gauge, surged over 30% to reach the high-20 levels.\n\nSmall caps were again the weakest segment of the market, given their heightened sensitivity to economic fundamentals. The Russell 2000 tumbled over 3%, extending declines after a 3.4% loss on Thursday.\n\nConsumer discretionary and technology were the worst-performing sectors, while semiconductors led the selloff among industries. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) plummeted over 5%, marking a double-digit loss in the last two sessions, its worst performance since March 2020.\n\nNvidia Corp. fell an additional 3.4% following a 6.7% decline on Thursday, as the chipmaker came under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for potential antitrust violations.\n\nTreasuries were the biggest gainers among major assets, reflecting a broad-based flight-to-quality sentiment. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallied 2.9%, its strongest performance since the U.S. regional bank crisis in March 2023.\n\nThe Japanese yen also gained significantly, with the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE:FXY) up 1.8%.\n\nGold edged down slightly by 0.6%, while oil prices fell more than 4% for the day, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude retreating to $72 a barrel.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell over 3%.\n\nFriday’s Performance In US Major Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day Chg % Dow Jones 39,492.36 -2.1% S&P 500 5,321.21 -2.3% Nasdaq 100 18,355.31 -2.8% Russell 2000 2,110.14 -3.4%\n\nUpdated at 1:05 p.m. ET\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 2.2% lower to $531.13. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) fell 1.9% to $395.39. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust Series (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 2.6% to $447.80. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) fell 3.5% to $208.99. Sector-wise, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) outperformed, up 0.1%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) tumbled by 3.4%.\n\nFriday’s Stock Movers\n\nStocks reacting to earnings reports were:\n\nAmazon, Inc.

        "content": "Sun Country Airlines operates eight Boeing 737-800 converted freighters for Amazon. By the third quarter of next year the cargo fleet will grow to 20 aircraft. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nCargo revenue at Sun Country Airlines inched up in the second quarter despite reduced flight activity on behalf of Amazon, but is expected to jump one year from now when the retail giant supplies additional Boeing 737-800 freighters to the carrier.\n\nThe two companies in late June agreed on an expanded transportation services agreement under which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will deliver eight Boeing 737-800 converted cargo jets it controls through a long-term lease to support package deliveries in its domestic logistics network.\n\nThe planes will be pulled from current contractor Atlas Air, and transferred to Sun Country starting in March of 2025. The date range provided in Friday’s briefing with analysts was more specific than previous statements that the leisure airline would begin operating the initial aircraft in the first quarter, with the remainder of the planes delivered on a rolling basis by the third quarter.\n\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) on Thursday reported cargo revenue of $25 million, up 1.7% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to an annual rate escalation that went into effect in December. Cargo flight hours dipped 2.4% to accommodate scheduled heavy maintenance, but are expected to grow in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nSun Country has operated a dozen Amazon-supplied Boeing narrowbody cargo jets since 2020. The revised contract for crews, maintenance and insurance to operate the eight additional cargo jets was also extended through 2030 and gives Sun Country better rates, in addition to increasing its freighter fleet to 20 aircraft.\n\n“Sun Country’s cargo segment will become a larger portion of our business starting in mid-2025. By 2026, we expect revenue from our cargo segment to be almost 20% of our total revenue, versus approximately 10% in 2024. The expansion of our cargo segment comes with almost no required capex and drives improved profitability and greater free cash flow,” said Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis on the earnings call.\n\nCargo’s share of operating revenue at large U.S. passenger carriers that don’t operate dedicated freighters is about 3% in a typical year.\n\nManagement stressed that the Amazon deal will further diversify Sun Country’s revenue base, placing less reliance on the volatile scheduled passenger and charter business to vacation destinations.\n\nAs previously announced, the airline will temporarily suspend service to some markets next year so pilots and other resources can focus on ramping up the Amazon cargo service.\n\nSun Country said overall revenue fell 2.6% to $254 million during the quarter. Sales were hurt by overcapacity across the domestic industry and by flight cancellations in late June. The company was able to lower unit costs by nearly 5% compared to the prior year. Net income dropped 91% to $1.8 million, the company’s eighth consecutive quarter of profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nSun Country’s cargo revenue in 2023 increased 10.4% year over year to $100 million while most of the air cargo industry, including express air carriers, experienced downturns in aircraft utilization and revenue. The airline benefited from Amazon gaining share in a declining domestic parcel market, where it overtook FedEx and UPS last year in total deliveries. First-quarter cargo revenue at Sun Country increased 2.5%, to $24 million, from the same period a year ago.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nTwitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.com\n\nRELATED READING:\n\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\n\nThe post Amazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines’ revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenge Of The Rest: These Three S&P 493 Stocks Are Set To Pop\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nU.S. equities have been dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" accounting for the majority of the gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The highly esteemed group comprises seven of the largest companies in the U.S.: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese tech titans make up about a third of the index’s total value, overshadowing the performance of the other 493 companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has gained over 37% year-to-date, overshadowing the broader index's 15.8% returns over this period.\n\nCheck It Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding the potential overvaluation of the tech heavyweights have been racking investors, causing the S&P 500 index to decline by nearly 30 basis points over the past month.\n\nNonetheless, analysts are bullish on the remaining 493 stocks in the index.\n\n“So we’re seeing a diverging trend between the Magnificent Seven and the [S&P] 493 happening this quarter. The other 493 were basically in an earnings recession up until last quarter. We expect this earnings season is going to be the first quarter for the other 493 to post positive earnings growth since Q4 of ’22, whereas the Mag 7, their earnings growth is expected to decelerate for the second straight quarter and again in Q3. And by Q4 of this year consensus points to basically similar growth rates between the two and I think that will really be the catalyst for the rotation in the market to take place,” said Ohsung Kwon, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Securities.\n\nAmong the S&P 493, several dividend stocks stand out as potential winners in this expected market rotation.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has been steadily investing in its 5G network. The company added 391,000 total broadband connections in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband additions. Verizon's total broadband subscribers stood at 11.5 million as of the end of the second quarter, reflecting a 17.2% rise from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon pays $2.66 in dividends annually, yielding 6.64% on the current price. The company is currently on track to becoming a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years as of 2023.\n\n\"Our consistently disciplined approach to driving strong cash flow, operating the business, and serving our customers has once again put the Board in a position to raise the dividend,\" Verizon's Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a news release, \"We continue to deliver value to our shareholders as we execute our network-as-a-service strategy.\"\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation’s 1%.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to understand the art market dynamics.\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading pharmacy chain, had been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat until earlier this year when it slashed its quarterly dividend payouts by 48% to 25 cents per share. The company currently pays $1 per share in dividends annually, yielding 8.22% on the current price.\n\nBefore the dividend cut in January 2024, Walgreens was on track to becoming a Dividend King, having raised its dividends for 47 consecutive years.\n\nHowever, the company has been focusing on bolstering its growth prospects by expanding its health care services, including partnerships with primary care providers and investments in digital health initiatives.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to reduce our quarterly dividend payment to 25 cents per share, to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position. This action reinforces our goal of increasing cash flow while freeing up capital to invest in sustainable growth initiatives in our pharmacy and health care businesses, which we believe will ultimately improve shareholder value,\" said Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, in a news release.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical giant, has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 with its vaccine development. As of December 2023, Pfizer currently pays $1.68 in dividends annually, yielding 5.35% on the current price. The company has increased its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nHowever, as COVID-19-related growth subsides, Pfizer's earnings have been declining. The company's net income amounted to $2.33 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 98% decline year-over-year. This comes as the pandemic-driven momentum wanes, causing Pfizer's profit margins to dwindle.\n\nNonetheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise in the near term at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "content": "One of the goals of investing should be to put your portfolio on autopilot. Fill it with quality companies and then set it and forget it. The benefit of the strategy is it removes the temptation to trade in and out of stocks.\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management found that over the 20-year period between January 2003 and December 2022, if an investor put $10,000 into the S&P 500 and then left it alone for two decades, he would have almost $65,000 at the end.\n\nIf that same investor tried to time his entry and exit points but just missed the stock market’s 10 best days, that same investor would have less than $30,000 at the end.

It gets even worse if you miss more days.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the extreme of missing the 60 best days over 20 years, you would end up with about $4,200 or a loss of some 93% of the total. That is why buy-and-hold investing is a superior strategy.\n\nBut what should you buy? While you could buy the benchmark index as in the JPMorgan study, blue-chip stocks are a good alternative. These are successful, global businesses with solid financials earning generous profits that still have good, long-term growth prospects.\n\nBelow are three top blue-chip stocks you can buy today and forget for the next two decades. You can thank me in 20 years.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading payment processor Visa (NYSE:V) is the first blue-chip stock to buy and then forget about. A $10,000 investment in Visa stock in 2008 would be worth an astounding $207,500 today. For doing nothing more than buying shares and then developing amnesia about it.\n\nAlthough shares are flat so far this year as high interest rates and elevated inflation dampen consumer spending, the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting rates could see shares grow once again. As it makes money by charging fees on every transaction using one of its 4.3 billion branded debit and credit cards.\n\nDuring Visa’s recent earnings conference call, management reiterated its full-year guidance for revenue to grow by low-double-digit rates while earnings would see low-teens growth.\n\nVisa stock is attractive as a long-term investment. As the leader in a market valued in the trillions of dollars, it remains extremely profitable and rewards investors with a dividend that yields around 1%. Yet the payment processor has grown its payout at double-digit rates over the last five years making it a blue-chip stock to buy today.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending Cuts\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIntegrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) should be in your set-and-forget portfolio too. The idea that we have reached peak oil has been put to rest. Advanced drilling techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have opened up new reserves and made the U.S. one of the world’s biggest oil producers.\n\nWhile renewable sources of energy will continue to expand the percentage of energy demand they meet, there remains a large, expansive market for fossil fuels. As automakers recently found out, all-electric vehicles aren’t quite as in demand as originally hoped. The industry is quickly retooling to manufacture hybrids because the reliability and availability of gasoline can’t be matched. And almost all EV charging stations are powered by fossil fuel plants, too.\n\nChevron has extensive upstream, midstream and downstream assets. It is focusing on its most profitable projects for exploration and production, operating a broad system of pipeline and storage facilities and offering a nationwide network of refineries and fuel stations.\n\nBrent crude oil currently trades at $81 a barrel. Chevron, however, can remain profitable and support its dividend if the international benchmark falls as low as $50 a barrel. Even during the pandemic when the price of oil plunged to negative $37 a barrel, it maintained its payout. Lock up Chevron stock today and throw away the key.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nArguably the best stock to put on autopilot for your portfolio is Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The retail king was founded in 1962 and went public in 1970. Since then it has become an essential and integral part of the economy. With virtually everyone living within a few miles of one of its supercenters, Walmart remains vital to consumers’ everyday lives.\n\nA $10,000 investment 20 years ago would be worth nearly $60,000 today. While not nearly as remarkable as Visa’s returns, remember grocery stores like Walmart operate on razor-thin margins. Net profit margins for the biggest retailer run around 2% on annual sales of $657 billion. Yet year in and year out, Walmart chugs along growing and expanding its offerings.\n\nOnline sales are now incredibly important to its growth. Last year, Walmart notched some $100 billion in e-commerce revenue making it the second-biggest online operation after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nWalmart stock is not going to see the same level of growth as other companies but it is a reliable performer through all kinds of markets. That’s just the sort of performance you want in a blue-chip stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX stock.

        "content": "Amazon's Narrowed Margins Overshadow Cloud Computing's Growth Reacceleration\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported its second quarter results. Although its financials showed AWS growth has reaccelerated, this piece of good news was overshadowed by increased capital spending that pressured margins. Amazon has joined Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) in their AI spending spree.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Amazon reported revenue grew 10% YoY to $148.0 billion, which came short of LSEG’s $148.56 billion consensus estimate.\n\nBy inserting ads into Prime Video, Amazon fueled its advertising revenue that went up as much as 20% to $12.77 billion, but this was still short of StreetAccount’s consensus estimate of $13 billion. This is a slowdown compared to the previous quarter when Amazon recorded YoY growth of 24%. Undoubtedly, advertising is Amazon’s fastest-growing revenue stream. It is also one of its highest-margin businesses.\n\nAmazon touted the growth of its core profit driving segment, AWS, whose sales surged 19% to $26.28 billion, with operating income of $9.3 billion greatly exceeding that of last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to $5.4 billion. AWS growth accelerated from previous quarter’s 17% while Microsoft reported its cloud computing unit, Azure, slowed from 31% reported in the previous quarter to 29%. Although Amazon has not revealed the exact contribution of generative AI to AWS’s top line, it did state back in May that the developing technology has grown into a multi-billiion dollar revenue run-rate business. But, the segment’s margins shrinked by 2 percentage points to 36%, as they were squeezed by investments in property and equipment that rose 50% to $17.6 billion. After pulling back after the pandemic, Amazon went back to increasing its capital spending.\n\nNet income doubled to $13.5 billion, $1.26 per diluted share, topping analyst estimates for EPS of $1.03 and for net income of $11 billion.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nAmazon guided for current quarter sales to range between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates to year-over-year growth between 8% and 11%. Operating income outlook is in the range between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion, which is a further signal that the AI spending spree threatens to eat into profits.\n\nThe need for evidence to justify the AI spending spree.\n\nLike its tech peers, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon needs to prove its hefty AI investments are worth the immense cost. Earlier this week, Microsoft also revealed a surge in capital spending for the sake of building its AI infrastructure. Covering all cloud and AI-related spending, Microsoft revealed its capital expenditure surged almost 80% YoY to $19 billion. As for the 2024 fiscal year, Microsft reported full year capital expenditure of $55.7 billion, adding that it will continue to rise next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "What Are the Hottest E-Commerce Stocks Right Now? 3 Top Picks.",
        "content": "The e-commerce scene has faced considerable challenges in recent years. With an inflation-hit consumer inclined to put their wallets away when it comes to bigger-ticket discretionary items, e-commerce firms have had to ride out the harsh waves in recent quarters.\n\nWith the first (of potentially many) Fed rate cuts likely just months away, consumers may feel just a bit better about pulling the trigger on the pricier purchases they may have postponed. Indeed, the anticipation of lower rates alone can be a powerful thing.\n\nIn any case, I view the broader basket of e-commerce stocks as intriguing value buys now that they’re in a tough spot with relatively muted expectations ahead of them. Who knows? Maybe in a few years, when the days of inflation and high interest rates fall into the rearview, the e-commerce names may benefit from a potential return of a so-called “roaring 20s” type of environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three top e-commerce picks for investors looking to play a multi-year recovery in e-tail spending.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the Magnificent Seven e-commerce firm that may very well be the best bargain of the batch right now. With a record-breaking Prime Day now in the books, questions linger as to whether deal-hungry consumers will follow up the extravagant two-day sale with more historic sales come Black Friday and Boxing Day 2024.\n\nEither way, the strong Prime Day is a very encouraging sign that the consumer may finally feel better about splurging again. Additionally, as prices come down across various goods, perhaps the second half of 2024 will see e-commerce make its big comeback.\n\nConsumer spending aside, Amazon is also doing a pretty good job of making up for lost time on AI. With its Metis large language model, a product that’s supposedly “more powerful” than ChatGPT, on the horizon (will this AI be a part of that big Alexa LLM upgrade?), perhaps the Echo device will finally be able to make strides to hit its customer lifetime value (CLV).\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nWith less disposable income in personal balance sheets, you can bet that the average consumer is going to be more selective with how they spend their money. When costs of living soar, every dollar needs to go that much further.\n\nWhen it comes to heavy discounts in the world of e-tail, it’s tough to top the wildly popular phenomenon known as Temu, a Chinese firm owned by PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD), formerly known as Pinduoduo.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, the quality of Temu goods may not be the best in the world. However, when it comes to price, it’s virtually impossible for anybody else to stay remotely competitive. As Temu continues getting consumers hooked on shopping on its platform via gamified rewards (think Fishland, Coin Spin, and Card Flip) while continuing to make noise on popular social media platforms, I don’t see PDD stock slowing down anytime soon.\n\nPDD is the king of low-cost goods, and it seems well-equipped to fare well as the sting of last year’s inflationary surge remains. Also, at 17.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), there does not seem to be much in the way of expectations baked in.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo is over an orange background with a little shopping cart with packages in it. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has been much tougher sledding than two other two e-commerce juggernauts in this piece. The stock is down 20% year to date and more than 77% from its all-time high. Indeed, fans of the platform may find it worthwhile to pick up a few shares while it’s in a historic funk. That said, at 29.7 times trailing P/E, shares still aren’t as cheap as you’d think, given the magnitude of the decline.\n\nFurther, the company’s reputation as a seller of handmade and vintage goods may have taken a hit with the number of merchants who sell mass-produced products, some of which you may find on Temu on the Etsy platform.\n\nIn any case, Etsy’s latest policy update, which aims to reclassify items by various categories, including “made by” and “designed by,” is encouraging and could help Etsy regain the handcrafted, vintage vibes that made it so great to begin with. If Etsy can regain its strong footing in handmade crafts, ETSY stock could have miles to gain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Amazon.

        "title": "Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip",
        "content": "When it comes to the Magnificent Seven and big tech stocks, one of the ones I like the least is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as I find its business model less appealing and a little more fragile when compared to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nEven so, it is undeniable that the Google parent company has its moats and an excellent operational track record.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nAs the company is far from bad, I believe this recent dip makes the stock even more attractive, which, if it maintains its prospects of growing by double digits a year, is very cheap.\n\nIs the business model threatened?\n\nLooking at the forward price-earnings of the main Magnificent Seven companies, it is clear Alphabet stands out as the one with the lowest indicator. While the search machine is trading at 21 times its next 12 months' earnings, companies like Microsoft and Apple are already over 30, not to mention Amazon and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which add further distortion to this comparison. Even Meta (NASDAQ:META), which in recent history had the lowest multiples, has overtaken the tech giant.\n\nNote that although Alphabet has never stood out as a company that is traded with a rich multiple, in many periods it was much closer to the other companies, and only in recent months has this gap opened up. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nGOOGL Data by GuruFocus\n\nOf course, there is a reason for this. Even though the market often acts in a dysfunctional way, this would hardly happen without a plausible justification, especially for one of the world's largest companies. The main reason for the stock trading at this level, while maintaining an expectation of double-digit sales growth, is the threat to its main business, Google Search.\n\nIn the second quarter, the search tool accounted for 57% of the group's revenue, while other initiatives such as YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud were closer to 10% each. Even with this dependence, credit must be given to Alphabet, which over the years has built up a complete and diversified business model. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nAccording to some bears, Google's search model could be disrupted or slowed down by large language models. Today, the most common thing when you want to go to a restaurant or have a question is to go to the search engine and type it in. One of the narratives suggests this could easily be replaced by a question to your chatbot, be it GPT Chat, Alexa or Siri. If, instead of searching, many people start using these other methods, search becomes less relevant and directly impacts the company's revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy take tends toward skepticism. However long it takes for this narrative to materialize, instead of completely disrupting Google Search, it may only be something that will add obstacles, reducing growth rather than bringing about a stagnation or decrease in this line of revenue in the short and medium term. Artificial intelliegence will gradually become more popular, but to reach a considerable mass of the population that adopts it in their daily lives and replaces their habits of using Google search as a tool could take years.\n\nAs Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, even if this happens gradually, the company will be able to balance it with growth at other ends, whether in the cloud, through YouTube or a new line of revenue with Gemini. There is a range of options that bring an interesting vision and can help sustain this growth in the long run.\n\nStick with the fundamentals\n\nIn many cases, investors tend to turn something simple into something complex. While this can sometimes be necessary, especially in technology segments that are very dynamic and the outlook changes all the time, overcomplicating something and getting carried away with the narrative is a very common mistake.\n\nTrying to look at it pragmatically, in a stick with the fundamentals analysis, Alphabet is still an excellent company. In the breakdown of revenue, you can see that search revenue and Google Play advanced by 14% year over year, YouTube by 13% and Google Cloud by 29%. Alphabet is far from a dying business. Even with this growth, the miss in YouTube ad revenue disappointed the market, which together with the higher capital expenditures, caused the stock to fall post-earnings.\n\nBut it does not stop there. As well as having a growth rank of 10 on the GF Score, its profitability rank is also solid at 10. Its financial strength is also very good with cash on hand of over $100 billion. In terms of profitability, it is worth highlighting a net margin of 26.70% as well as a return on invested capital of 32.50%, which shows a cash cow business model and assertive capital allocation. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nHow about the future?\n\nAlphabet's capital allocation is very good as it has robust cash on hand, which could eventually turn into another successful acquisition like YouTube, or reinvestment in the business that is transformed to at least remain relevant in industries like search, AI and cloud. In the second quarter, the company made capital expenditures of more than $13 billion to cope with a robust infrastructure that supports the advancement of Google Cloud, Google Search and other businesses through data centers, but it put pressure on free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a risk that search will be affected, this is not a trend that seems likely to occur in the medium term. As already mentioned, this depends on the mass replacement and adoption of a new tool by the population. In the short and medium term, this technological evolution could bring greater assertiveness to ads and searches, boosting this market as a positive trend.\n\nWhen it comes to competition, although Google has recently lost ground to Bing (Microsoft's search engine), Alphabet still has a virtual monopoly, with more than 80% of the search market according to Statista. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: Statista\n\nIn this way, the future for search is partly cloudy, but it does not seem so uncertain that it can be labeled a dying business.\n\nEverything has a price\n\nIn addition to the multiples, which became even more attractive after the recent dip, other methods reinforce that Alphabet's stock is at a level that will remunerate shareholders well. If we run a reverse discounted cash flow model using earnings per share, projecting growth of 15% per year for the next 10 years and 10% for the following decade, we find the current share price by discounting at a rate of 12%. In other words, if the company manages to achieve greater growth than this, the annual return for the shareholder would be above 12%, making the stock a real compounder.\n\nThis becomes even more interesting when we look at the last five years, where the earnings per share compound annual growth rate has been 25.90%. Although the company does not need to maintain this level consistently, it is possible that positive surprises could happen along the way so that EPS growth could exceed the projected 10% to 15% per year. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nIf we use more reasonable assumptions to try to find a fair price, it is still possible to find an interesting upside. With 18% in the first 10 years and 8% in the last 10, discounting by 11% (still a high and restrictive figure for a company of such quality), we would have a fair value of $212 per share, equivalent to an upside of 21%. I used EPS instead of free cash flow because of the recent history of high capex, which would negatively bias the reverse DCF model.\n\nAccording to the GF Value Line, the stock should be worth around $155, which currently qualifies it as fairly valued, showing that although Alphabet is much cheaper than its tech peers, it's still not a huge bargain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAlphabet still has relevant moats and is not a dying business. For this reason, even though there is a certain cloudiness to some parts of its business model, the discrepancy between the premium for companies like Apple and Microsoft seems to have become very large, while there is a discount on the Google parent's shares that makes it more attractive, especially after this dip.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

The best retirement stocks have rising revenue and profits, along with long-term catalysts.\n\nThe great thing about most retirement stocks is that you don’t have to spend as much time monitoring them. These corporations have become household names and have a history of delivering long-term returns. They have loyal customer bases that can benefit investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWondering which retirement stocks may be a good fit for your portfolio? These are some of the top picks to consider.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a strong lead in multiple industries. Amazon’s online marketplace reinvented commerce and forced competitors to offer free two-day shipping for their members. Amazon makes millions of products readily available, but that’s not the company’s only strength.\n\nThe tech giant is the leading cloud computing provider with almost one-third of the entire market. The cloud business, Amazon Web Services grew by 17% YOY in the first quarter, while overall sales jumped by 13% YOY. While double-digit growth rates are impressive, the company’s advertising segment is attracting more attention from investors.\n\nAmazon ad revenue came to $11.8 billion in the quarter which was up by 24% YOY. There isn’t much competition in the ad industry besides the well-known duopoly. However, Amazon’s continued ad growth and platforms can help it gain market share from its fellow tech giants. Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the stock and believe that it has more room to run. The average price target suggests a potential 23% upside.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign.

CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is one of the healthiest fast-food restaurants in the industry. The focus on health has helped Chipotle keep its elevated prices while competitors with less healthy food options have been forced to offer affordable choices and minimize the price hikes.\n\nShares have more than tripled over the past five years and are up by 11% year-to-date. The restaurant chain attracted plenty of buzz leading up to its 50-for-1 stock split but is now in a deep correction. The lower price presents a long-term buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle’s second-quarter results suggest there’s still plenty of upside for the stock. Revenue increased by 18.2% YOY to reach $3.0 billion. The company also opened 52 new restaurants in the quarter and reported a 33% YOY growth in net income. Chipotle’s net profit margin came to 15.3%. The restaurant giant remains on target to open 285 to 315 restaurants this year.\n\nGarmin (GRMN) Garmin company logo on a storefront\n\nSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nGarmin (NYSE:GRMN) presents growth at a reasonable price, trading at a 25 P/E ratio and offering a 1.69% yield. Shares have more than doubled over the past five years and are off to a 41% year-to-date gain.\n\nThe company operates in five industries: fitness, outdoor, aviation, marine, and automotive OEM. All of those segments improved YOY in the first quarter, but the Fitness segment is the most impactful. Many athletes use Garmin watches to gain more data on every workout. You can see it in the results. Garmin reported 40% YOY revenue growth for its Fitness segment. It’s the second-largest category and makes up roughly a quarter of the company’s total sales.\n\nThe Auto OEM segment grew at a robust 58% YOY to reach $129 million in revenue. It’s the smallest segment of Garmin’s business, but a rising growth rate can make it more impactful in future earnings results.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "title": "Get Your Money Out of These 3 Healthcare Stocks ASAP",
        "content": "In general, I’m quite bullish on the healthcare sector. Many of the names in the space have extremely low valuations because a high percentage of investors irrationally believed that healthcare companies could never perform well when interest rates were high.\n\nWhat’s more, a multitude of firms within the sector should be helped by lower interest rates because they will be able to borrow money more cheaply in order to fund their initiatives such as drug research. Moreover, increased utilization of artificial intelligence is making drug research cheaper and more likely to be successful.\n\nNevertheless, some healthcare stocks have very poor outlooks, either because their business models are broken or because their drug candidates have little or no chance of being approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). And when small healthcare companies’ drug candidates fail, their stocks usually plunge tremendously. Here are three healthcare stocks to sell now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCassava (SAVA) Alzheimer's disease concept, Elderly woman holding brain symbol of missing jigsaw puzzle, World Alzheimer's, World mental health, Memory loss, Dementia, Parkinson disease.\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock.com\n\nCassava (NASDAQ:SAVA) stock soared 90% in the five days that ended on July 31. The rally was primarily based on misplaced optimism.\n\nSpecifically, investors appeared to become more bullish on SAVA stock after Cassava Executive Chairman Richard Barry wrote in a letter to shareholders that, “Our first Phase 3 trial is expected to read out by December 2024,”\n\nBut I believe that the FDA is unlikely to allow the trial to finish. One reason for my view is that, according to University of Texas at San Antonio Professor of Biology George Perry, the approach that Cassava’s drug, simufilam, uses to treat Alzheimer’s “is not well-substantiated.” He should know. Perry also serves as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\nIn a phone interview with InvestorPlace, Perry said only a single lab provided a majority of the data that supports the drug’s mechanism of action. City University of New York neuroscientist Hoau-Yan Wang ran the lab. The Justice Department indicted him last month for allegedly falsifying data related to simufilam.\n\n“Now that (Wang’s) data is being questioned, Cassava’s approach is more tenuous,” said Perry. “And if there are questions about the data, it may not be  appropriate to continue” the ongoing Phase 3 trial of simufilam.”\n\nGiven that the Phase 3 trial was based on Wang’s data, Professor Perry said the findings should be produced by another laboratory.\n\nCVS Health (CVS) The logo for CVS Pharmacy is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn the first quarter, CVS Health’s (NYSE:CVS) operating income tumbled to $2.27 billion from $3.44 billion a year earlier. Moreover, its earnings per share sank to 88 cents from $1.65 in Q2 of 2023. Importantly, the firm also reduced the low end of its full-year operating cash flow guidance $10.5 billion from $12 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm blamed the decline in profits on cost pressures on its Medicare insurance business. It explained that the Medicare recipients it insures used more medical services than they previously did.\n\nHowever, I believe that CVS’s pharmacy benefits management and drug prescription businesses are being hurt by increased competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has entered the drug-prescription space.\n\nMoreover, its retail business, like that of WalgreensBoots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), is being undermined “by tough competition from the large retail chains such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT).” Additionally, it faces “increased shoplifting in some areas of the U.S.”\n\nGiven CVS’s many tough challenges, I view it as one of the top healthcare stocks to sell at this point.\n\nTeladoc Health (TDOC) Teladoc Health (TDOC) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeladoc Health’s (NYSE:TDOC) just-reported second-quarter financial results indicate the company continues to have difficulty gaining traction in the hypercompetitive  telemedicine space.\n\nRevenue fell 2% versus the same period a year earlier to $642 million. Moreover, the firm’s net cash provided by operating activities dropped to $97.6 million from $114 million in Q2 2023. Most ominously, the company’s total visits sank to 4.2 million last quarter from 4.7 million a year ago. The decline indicates tough competition in the space is taking a significant toll on Teladoc’s ability to attract patients.\n\nAnother indicator of fierce competition is Teladoc spending over $220 million on sales and advertising last quarter. That is more than one-third of its revenue.\n\nAnd clearly, the Street was not pleased with the company’s results. TDOC stock sank 15% in the wake of its report. Considering Teladoc’s steep competition, it makes the telehealth company one of the healthcare stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in SAVA and a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock index futures fell abruptly Friday, continuing recent weakness following weak earnings from tech giants as well as concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nAt 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), Dow Jones Futures fell 380 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 Futures dropped 59 points, or 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 Futures slumped 295 points, or 1.6%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after a softer-than-expected ISM report on U.S. manufacturing caused investors to fret about a possible recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, the NASDAQ Composite fell 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped almost 500 points, or 1.2%.\n\nIntel, Amazon disappoint; Apple earnings beat estimates\n\nSentiment was also hit by poorly received earnings from tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which overshadowed positive numbers from iPhone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nChipmaker Intel stock slumped over 20% premarket as its June quarter earnings missed estimates. The company also suspended its dividend and said it will cut 15% of its jobs as part of a turnaround plan.\n\nAmazon stock fell more than 8% after the e-commerce giant provided a softer-than-expected outlook on revenue, and warned that online sales were slowing as consumers grew more cautious over purchases.\n\nApple stock traded largely unchanged after the company reported stronger-than-expected revenue and profit in the June quarter.\n\nThis came on the back of slightly better than expected sales of its flagship iPhone, although device sales did fall from last year amid growing competition in top market China.\n\nPayrolls data due\n\nA round of economic data has spurred fears of a faster-than-expected economic slowdown amid fears the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained its restrictive monetary policy for too long.\n\nThe focus now turns to the July official jobs report, with investors looking for further signs that the U.S. labor market is easing.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nCrude on track for more weekly losses\n\nCrude prices rose Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight week of losses given mounting concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nBy 06:30 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.3% to $76.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $79.72 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks have declined around 8% over the last four weeks as disappointing economic data from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia, Europe and the United States raised concerns of weak global economic growth, weighing on oil consumption.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe weak economic prints saw markets largely look past heightened tensions in the Middle East after the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran earlier in the week.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, made no changes to its production policies after an online meeting on Thursday, reiterating that it could pause plans to increase output from October.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures sink after weak tech earnings; payrolls due\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet cut stake in Crowdstrike before July global outage\n\nLyondellBasell Q2 profit tops estimates, revenue rises as seasonal demand improves\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Top 3 Blockchain Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "Investing in blockchain stocks may elicit a hard pass from some investors who believe that this is a gateway into cryptocurrency. It is used in peer-to-peer transactions that are one of the core tenets of digital currency. But the potential of blockchain technology goes well beyond Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nOne of the best ways to understand blockchain is that it gives individuals and organizations a way to store and secure, their data without relying on a third party. That’s what a decentralized environment means. As Divya Premkumar summarized for InvestorPlace, blockchain, “…has created a paradigm shift in how we own and manage data while redefining traditional business models.”\n\nThis paradigm shift is why the sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 52.8% between now and 2032. And it’s why you should be thinking about ways to invest in blockchain stocks that still allow you to own stocks that fit your broader investment philosophy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the reasons to believe that blockchain technology is the future is that a company like Visa (NYSE:V) has so readily adopted it. This is about how money is likely to move in the future. And companies like Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) didn’t want to be left behind.\n\nCryptocurrency is a big part of the story. After all, Visa’s revenue stream is based on transactions. It didn’t want to be on the outside looking in when it comes to the integration of blockchain and crypto. In fact, Visa has an entire section of its website aimed at “Unlocking Crypto Opportunities” for businesses.\n\nMy point is, owning V stock makes sense for many investors, even without blockchain. The 10-year total return on V stock is 440%. And its investment in blockchain is proof of concept for the technology and another reason to believe that this is a stock that will be there for you when you need it in the future.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother pick among blockchain stocks that doesn’t require you to get out of your comfort zone is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company is an e-commerce giant that’s also known for its Amazon Web Services (AWS). That’s where the company is making strides in artificial intelligence. And it’s also where the company has an emerging blockchain story.\n\nThe AWS platform is the home of Amazon Managed Blockchain that includes free blockchain training as an AWS Skill Builder. It’s an opportunity for AWS customers to create and manage a personal blockchain network.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, that’s an area left to clients using Web3 projects. But in the future, there will likely be opportunities to use blockchain in the company’s legacy e-commerce business.\n\nThe takeaway for investors is, like Visa, there are many reasons to own AMZN stock today that have nothing to do with blockchain. But Amazon appears to be in a unique position to drive revenue from this technology in the coming years.\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) Illustration of an ETF in multiple sectors.\n\nSource: SWKStock / Shutterstock\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) have their place in a portfolio. When it comes to investing in blockchain stocks, the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) is one of the leading options. The fund was launched in 2021 and has over $122 million in assets under management (AUM).\n\nIt has 27 holdings as of July 31, 2024 and 69% of the fund’s holdings are from U.S.-based companies. But some of these are not household names. For example, you won’t find Visa or Amazon in this fund’s holdings. But you do get exposure to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) which will be needed in the buildout of the technology.\n\nThe fund gained of over 33% in the last 12 months, but it is down over 40% since its inception. That should give you confidence that it’s a fund with plenty of upside. Plus, it has a reasonable 0.50% expense ratio and even pays a dividend that currently yields 2.76%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For instance, the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) has regularly outperformed the S&P 500 while having over half its total assets in the Information Technology sector. QQQ tracks the Nasdaq 100.\n\nAlmost half of this fund’s assets are allocated to 10 companies, including all Magnificent Seven stocks. Many investors have done well by spreading their capital across tech stocks, but some are in better positions than others.\n\nRecent dips, strong earnings and competitive advantages are some of the dynamics that make some tech stocks more attractive than others. Comparing many investment opportunities can help determine which ones present better prospects for long-term investors. These are three of the tech stocks that can result in long-term gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor better or for worse, your summer will be unforgettable with this stock. Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is under fire for a global IT outage that affected many businesses and consumers. The company has been on damage control ever since. Luckily, most of the woes are over, as 97% of Windows seniors are back online.\n\nShares were up by more than 50% year-to-date before the IT outage. Now, the stock is down year-to-date. Delta (NYSE:DAL) asking for Crowdstrike to cover its lost revenue looks like one of the last big obstacles before Crowdstrike can proceed to rebuild its reputation and grow again.\n\nPatient investors who can wait at least three years may view this recent dip as attractive. Crowdstrike isn’t the first company to make a major mistake, and it most certainly won’t be the last. The company has over a decade of experience and has built significant trust over that stretch. Investors, business owners and consumers will gradually forget about this episode within the next 1-2 years. Meanwhile, Crowdstrike delivered 33% YOY revenue growth in Q1 FY25. Net income surged from $0.5 million to $42.8 million in one year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s now look at a stock with less scrutiny than Crowdstrike. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a household name for the right reasons. Its online marketplace is second to none, with millions of products, free 2-day shipping and numerous perks. Many business owners use Amazon Web Services to store data, and that segment is experiencing a boost thanks to artificial intelligence. Amazon also owns Twitch and Whole Foods.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s very hard to avoid Amazon; you can see that reality in the company’s financial results. The tech giant delivered 13% YOY revenue growth amid rising growth from Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising segments. Domestic and international sales both achieved double-digit growth rates.\n\nInvestors will have a hard time finding anyone who is bearish about Amazon stock. It’s rated as a Strong Buy among 44 analysts, and the stock only has Buy ratings. The average price target suggests a 23% upside. Even the lowest price target of $200 per share implies that Amazon stock is set to reward investors with more gains.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is the smallest company with a $7.5 billion market cap. The stock hasn’t had the best stretch since its IPO and is down by 19% year-to-date. However, the educational tech firm looks poised to deliver gains for patient investors.\n\nRevenue jumped by 45% year over year in the first quarter to reach $167.6 million. While sales continue to grow, the company’s rising profits are a big development. Duolingo reported $27.0 million in net income, compared to a $2.6 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nA rapidly growing user base supports the company’s financial strength. Duolingo now has almost 100 million monthly active users, while daily active users increased by 54% YOY. The app helps people learn languages through guided verbal and written lessons. It’s also expanding into other subjects like math and music to attract more users. As people increasingly learn new things online, Duolingo is positioned to thrive.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD and AMZN.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere’s a spending frenzy around AI, and this earnings season we’ve been getting more details on the pace of that outlay.\n\nMeta raised its capital expenditures forecast to the range of $37 billion to $40 billion. Microsoft spent $19 billion last quarter, including server farm leases. Amazon spent $30 billion so far this year and says it’ll kick it up a notch to close out 2024. Apple may be zagging, but clearly has a fresh AI focus of its own.\n\nWe’ve been told that generative AI is the next smartphone, the next internet — a transformational technology. That’s why these companies have ramped up spending in a generative AI-building arms race.\n\nThey’re spending because they believe in it, of course.\n\nBut is the spending also influencing that belief? Are the stakes now so high that even if the promise of generative AI doesn’t meet those lofty expectations, these companies, and their clients, will try to shoehorn it into products and processes where it’s not really needed?\n\nHistory is littered with “transformational” technologies that didn’t quite make the grade.\n\nDigital assistants, for example, like Amazon’s Alexa. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a former senior employee as saying, “We worried we’ve hired 10,000 people and we’ve built a smart timer.” Apple was reportedly spending $1 billion annually to develop a supposedly industry-changing vehicle before abandoning that effort earlier this year.\n\nOf course, a moonshot effort like the car was a sideline to Apple’s main business and hardly a lottery ticket for the company. It seems more so for Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, even Tesla, which are putting AI front and center in their pitch to investors. They’re motivated to make it work.\n\nAnd make it work quickly. Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn called the infrastructure build a “cycle of competitive escalation” in a recent piece, positing that the hyperscalers would move much more slowly, and perhaps rationally, if not on each other’s heels.\n\nThe ensuing digestion period has already likely begun, if investors’ impatient reaction to Microsoft’s earnings is any indication. Meta, on the other hand, “continues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI,” wrote JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth in reaction to its numbers.\n\nAs he pointed out, “Management continues to expect Meta AI to become the most used AI assistant by the end of 2024, & open source Llama 3.1 should support a faster pace of innovation, better social/advertiser experiences, & cost benefits.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIs that transformational? Expect to continue to hear that it is, or will be. It has to — because they’re writing the checks.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Walmart's \"Everyday Low Price\" promise will be put to the test when it reports quarterly results, after rival Amazon.com's warning that customers had turned bargain hunters, pressuring the online shopping behemoth to forecast a weak current quarter.\n\nShares of Amazon sank nearly 9% in premarket trading on Friday, while Walmart's stock was marginally lower.\n\nMajor retailers including Target, bellwether Walmart and Kroger have been pushing to keep prices on essentials low as many Americans shun big ticket spending and turn to discount shopping in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nWalmart, due to report second quarter results on Aug. 15, is expected to post a 4% rise in quarterly revenue. However, that is set to be its slowest rate of growth in nearly two years, according to LSEG data.\n\nAmazon on Thursday reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter and said consumers were seeking out cheaper options for purchases leading the online giant to forecast current quarter revenue below expectations.\n\n\"Consumers are being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower average selling price products, looking for deals. That continued into the second quarter, and we expect it to continue into the third quarter,\" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a post-earnings call.\n\n\"(Amazon) Investors may stitch the second quarter retail margin stepdown together with the soft third quarter revenue guidance to create the narrative of worsening discounting needed to entice a softer consumer - and this is tough to disprove,\" RBC Capital markets analysts said in a note.\n\nResults from major consumer packaged goods companies including Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo also showed signs of a slowdown.\n\nWhile P&G reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales, PepsiCo missed analysts' expectations.\n\nThe second quarter tends to be leaner for retailers, with sales ramping up in the second half of the year with back-to-school and holiday season demand.\n\nShares of Walmart and Amazon have outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, rising 33% and 21% respectively, compared to the 14% gain in the broader index.\n\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Warren Buffett Stocks That Make for Sensational Buys in August",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has handily outperformed Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500. Since taking the reins in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha has practically doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500, and overseen a cumulative return in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) of over 5,310,000%, as of the closing bell on July 26.\n\nAlthough Buffett isn't infallible, a notable percentage of the 44 stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's $400 billion investment portfolio have increased in value over the long run. Even with the S&P 500 relatively close to its all-time high, some of these holdings remain sensational buys.\n\nWhat follows are three unstoppable Warren Buffett stocks that make for no-brainer buys in August. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nVisa\n\nThe first magnificent Buffett stock that makes for a sensational buy in August (and likely well beyond) is leading payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nSince peaking in March, Visa's stock has hit correction territory and declined by a little over 10%. Selling activity picked up last week, with the company's revenue falling short of Wall Street's consensus forecast for the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Though Visa missing sales estimates is a rarity, it's no cause for concern if you have a long-term mindset.\n\nThe great thing about financial stocks is that they're cyclical. This is to say that companies like Visa ebb-and-flow with the health of the U.S. and global economy. Even though slowdowns and recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they don't last long. By comparison, economic expansions typically endure for years, which gives Visa the opportunity to benefit from the natural expansion of consumer and enterprise spending.\n\nTo add to this point, Visa's management team has made a concerted effort to steer clear of lending. Despite giving up the potential to collect interest income and annual fees from cardholders, Visa's avoidance of lending ensures it won't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses or credit delinquencies. When recessions do occur, Visa is typically one of the first financial stocks to bounce back.\n\nVisa has an extensive growth runway, as well. On top of being the undisputed leader in credit card network purchasing volume in the U.S., Visa has the opportunity to organically or acquisitively (e.g., its purchase of Visa Europe in 2016) expand its payment infrastructure into faster-growing, but chronically underbanked, emerging markets. Consistent double-digit growth in cross-border payment volume speaks to this sustainable opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that Visa's stock is still relatively cheap. Investors can grab shares right now for 23 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 19% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Image source: Amazon.\n\nAmazon\n\nA second unstoppable Warren Buffett stock that's begging to be bought in August is none other than e-commerce colossus Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nThe biggest headwind for Amazon would be a U.S. or global recession. Since it's one of the stocks responsible for lifting the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to fresh all-time highs, a recession would likely weigh heavily on its share price and dominant e-commerce platform. Thankfully, as I pointed out earlier, recessions resolve fairly quickly.\n\nAlthough most consumers and investors are familiar with Amazon because of its globally leading online marketplace, e-commerce plays only a small role in its cash flow generation. Amazon's three ancillary operating segments, which have all been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage, are the catalysts that can push its stock, and cash flow, notably higher.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's long-term success than its cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to tech analysis company Canalys, AWS accounted for close to a third of all cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. Enterprise cloud spending is in its early innings of ramping up, and cloud-service margins are many multiples higher than the margins associated with online retail sales.\n\nAmazon's subscription and advertising services are the other two ancillary segments that continue to deliver phenomenal growth. Amazon becoming the exclusive streaming partner for Thursday Night Football, coupled with winning a long-term (11-year) streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), gives the company exceptional ad and subscription pricing power.\n\nBelieve it or not, Amazon is also inexpensive. While the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio works great for evaluating mature businesses, price-to-cash-flow tends to be a far better measure of value for high-growth companies that tend to reinvest most of their operating cash flow (like Amazon). After trading at a median year-end price-to-cash-flow ratio of 30 throughout the 2010s, investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for around 12 times forecast cash flow in 2025.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nThe third unstoppable Warren Buffett stock that makes for a sensational buy in August (and probably well beyond) is satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nWhereas Amazon is one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks responsible for leading the S&P 500 higher, Sirius XM has badly underperformed in a rip-roaring bull market. Its down year likely has to do with concerns that auto sales will weaken in the second-half of 2024. Sirius XM counts on promotional users (new vehicle buyers are occasionally given promotional access to Sirius XM's satellite services for a period of three months) eventually becoming self-pay subscribers. If fewer new vehicles are sold, it could lead a short-lived decline in satellite-radio subscribers.\n\nThe good news for current and prospective Sirius XM investors is that the company offers a number of competitive advantages that can make its patient shareholders notably richer.\n\nFor one, it's a legal monopoly. As the only licensed satellite-radio operator, Sirius XM enjoys strong subscription pricing power. With Spotify Technology once again increasing the cost of its monthly subscriptions, there's a good chance we'll see Sirius XM follow suit in the months to come.\n\nEven more important than Sirius XM's pricing power is its revenue diversity. Most online and terrestrial radio companies generate the bulk of their sales from advertising. While periods of economic growth are long-lasting, businesses aren't afraid to reduce their advertising budgets at the first sign(s) of trouble. Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its net sales from ads during the first quarter.\n\nComparatively, almost 78% of Sirius XM's net sales can be traced to its subscription services. Subscribers are less likely to cancel their service than businesses are to reduce their ad budgets. In other words, a subscription-driven model is going to yield more consistent operating cash flow.\n\nTo keep with the theme, Sirius XM Holdings' stock is a bargain. Shares can be had for 11.6 times forecast earnings per share in 2025, which equates to a 36% discount to its forward-year multiple over the last five years.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,059!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $41,963!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $338,864!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 29, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, but its stock fell more than 8% in Friday's premarket trade due to softer-than-anticipated guidance for the third quarter.\n\nThe e-commerce and cloud computing giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, beating the analyst estimate of $1.03.\n\nRevenue came in at $148.0 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $148.68 billion but up 10% YoY from $134.4 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nAmazon's third-quarter revenue guidance of $154-158.5 billion fell short of analyst expectations of $158.2 billion, contributing to the stock's decline.\n\n\"We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\" said Andy Jassy, Amazon President&CEO, highlighting the company's cloud computing segment.\n\nIn addition, online sales and third-party seller performance fell short of consensus by 0.3% and 1.2%, respectively. Management noted that although volume remained strong, lower average selling prices (ASPs) offset gains.\n\n\"This trend existed for past year and looks to continue in Q3,\" Jefferies analysts commented.\n\nThis suggests that consumers are \"being very value-conscious,\" analysts added. \"While more are choosing to shop on Amazon, they are buying cheaper items and spending less on high-priced discretionary items.\"\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) reported sales of $26.3 billion for Q2, up 19% YoY, while the North America segment saw a 9% increase to $90.0 billion. The International segment grew 7% to $31.7 billion, or 10% excluding foreign exchange impacts.\n\nOperating income more than doubled to $14.7 billion from $7.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon stock dips 8% in premarket trading on guidance miss, soft consumer trends\n\nPhilippine's Mynt gets valuation boost at $5 billion with Ayala, MUFG funding\n\nAtlassian shares slump on Cloud revenue miss, analyst downgrade\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to end the week on a losing note as weak activity data has investors fretting about the possibility of a U.S. recession. Nonfarm payrolls will be studied for growth clues, while results from tech heavyweights Apple and Amazon will also be in the spotlight.\n\n1. Payrolls loom large\n\nFriday’s economic highlight will be the release of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, as investors seek further clues on the health of the U.S. labor market and the broader economy.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range on Wednesday, where it has been since last July, but also opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September.\n\nIn the accompanying statement the Fed softened the description of inflation and said the risks to employment were now on a par with those of rising prices.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that U.S. job openings fell modestly in June, while new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week.\n\nA weak U.S. ISM manufacturing report also added to fears of an economic downturn and led investors to worry that the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in cutting rates.\n\n2. Futures fall on recession fears\n\nU.S. stock futures fell Friday, as investors digested some disappointing earnings from the important tech sector while awaiting the release of the widely-watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 225 points, or 0.5%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 48 points, or 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 295 points, or 1.6%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after a softer-than-expected ISM report on U.S. manufacturing caused investors to fret about a possible recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped almost 500 points, or 1.2%.\n\nInvestors will be focusing upon the official jobs report [see above] for more clues of the strength of the U.S. labor market, with risk sentiment ending the week on the back foot.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) released their earnings after the close Thursday [see below] and will be in the spotlight, as will Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after the chipmaker said it would cut more than 15% of its workforce and suspend its dividend starting in the fourth quarter as it pursues a turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\nStaying on the earnings front, oil majors Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) will be announcing their quarterly results Friday before the market open.\n\n3. Apple impresses despite Chinese woes\n\nApple reported Thursday third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, as a jump in services revenue helped offset softer iPhone revenue amid rising competition in China.\n\nThe tech giant’s stock rose 0.6% after hours, adding to gains of nearly 30% in the past three months, resulting in gains of around 13% over the course of this year.\n\nApple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than expectations.\n\nServices revenue rose 14% to record high of $24.21 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.01 billion.\n\nSales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected, although China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%.\n\nApple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei.\n\nDespite these difficulties, things could get better next quarter, as analysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September.\n\nThe company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June, and to operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices.\n\n4. Amazon reports slowing online sales growth\n\nAmazon stock slumped after hours after the online retail giant reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter, adding that price-conscious consumers were acting cautiously.\n\nAmazon’s online stores sales rose 5% in the second quarter to $55.4 billion, compared with growth of 7% in the first quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the company offered up third-quarter revenue guidance of $154-158.5 billion, short of expectations of $158.2 billion.\n\nCFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call that consumers \"are continuing to be cautious with their spending trading down.\"\n\n\"They are looking for deals,\" he added, noting that lower priced products were selling briskly.\n\nThis news has overshadowed generally positive results, with second-quarter profit and cloud computing sales beating analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon stock fell almost 7% after hours, but were still up over 20% year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude on track for fourth straight losing week\n\nCrude prices rose Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight week of losses given mounting concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 1.1% to $77.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $80.32 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks have declined around 8% over the last four weeks as disappointing economic data from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia, Europe and the United States raised concerns of weak global economic growth, weighing on oil consumption.\n\nThe weak economic prints saw markets largely look past heightened tensions in the Middle East after the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran earlier in the week.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, made no changes to its production policies after an online meeting on Thursday, reiterating that it could pause plans to increase output from October.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayrolls, slumping stocks, Apple, Amazon - what's moving markets\n\nStocks stumble on growth fears ahead of US payrolls\n\nSri Lanka needs to raise fiscal revenue to maintain stability, IMF says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Asian stocks slump on growth concerns; Nikkei hits 6-mth low in post-BOJ rout",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian stocks fell sharply on Friday, tracking an overnight rout on Wall Street on concerns over slowing economic growth, with a rout in Japanese markets deepening after the Bank of Japan struck a hawkish chord this week.\n\nWeak U.S. purchasing managers index and labor market data ramped up concerns over a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy, and that a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve could be potentially too late for the economy to achieve a soft landing.\n\nWeak earnings from majors such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also dented sentiment, largely offsetting a positive print from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). U.S. stock index futures fell sharply in Asian trade, with focus now turning to upcoming nonfarm payrolls data for more economic cues.\n\nNikkei hits 6-mth low in wake of hawkish BOJ\n\nJapanese markets were by far the worst performers among their Asian peers, with the Nikkei 225 index down nearly 5% to its weakest level since early-February. The broader TOPIX index shed 4.2%.\n\nJapanese stocks were already nursing sharp losses from Thursday, after the BOJ struck an unexpectedly hawkish tone during its end-July meeting.\n\nThe central bank hiked rates by 15 basis points and said it planned to raise rates further this year- presenting a clear end to the stimulative policies that boosted Japanese markets over the past year.\n\nA spike in the yen- on safe haven demand and on a hawkish BOJ- also weighed on Japanese stocks, particularly those with exposure to exports.\n\nToyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) (TYO:7203)- one of the biggest stocks on the Nikkei- fell 3.1% after its June quarter earnings slightly missed estimates, while the automaker also flagged slowing demand.\n\nAsian markets walloped by growth concerns\n\nBroader Asian markets all retreated, as risk appetite was battered by growing concerns over a global economic slowdown. Mixed technology earnings from the U.S. also sparked an extended rout in the sector.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI slid 3.3% on deep losses in heavyweight chipmakers, following dismal earnings from Intel. Before that, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) had also clocked underwhelming earnings as artificial intelligence appeared to be providing only a limited boost.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.1% on losses in major Chinese internet stocks.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 index slid 2.4%, as mining stocks tracked deep losses in commodity prices, while concerns over slowing growth in China also weighed.\n\nBut Chinese markets logged relatively lower losses than their regional peers, given that they were already trading at five-month lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, and were at their weakest levels since mid-February. Sentiment towards China remained weak following scant cues on stimulus from Beijing and a slew of weak PMI readings for July.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with the index set for a heavy degree of profit-taking after notching a record high above 25,000 points on Thursday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks slump on growth concerns; Nikkei hits 6-mth low in post-BOJ rout\n\nUS launches Nvidia antitrust probe after rivals' complaints, The Information reports\n\nPhilippine's Mynt gets valuation boost at $5 billion with Ayala, MUFG funding\n\nView comments",

        "content": "So much for retail therapy.\n\nAfter Amazon reported a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the third quarter on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 7% in after-hours trading, a top company executive posited a unique cause on a call with reporters.\n\nAmazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon web traffic patterns indicate that shoppers are distracted by rare, major news events—such as the Olympics and the historically turbulent US presidential race, which has already included both an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden dropping from the race—and are potentially deferring purchases as a result, or just skipping them altogether.\n\nSuch monumental news events in the past have made it \"harder to forecast,\" Olsavsky said, and company leaders are once again battling with that reality. Amazon said it was forecasting between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in revenue for the current third quarter, a range that suggests sales will likely come in below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion.\n\nRather than seeking comfort in the \"buy now\" button, it seems that shoppers are reacting to the roller-coaster news cycle by spending less.\n\nAmazon's revenue in the three months ended June 30 also came in slightly below expectations at $148 billion, though earnings were stronger than expected with net profit of $13.5 billion. While the number of goods — or units — sold by Amazon in the quarter was strong, customers favored items at lower price points, according to Olsavsky and CEO Andy Jassy, who made an appearance on a conference call with analysts.\n\nPart of that trend is due to economic worries, the executives said they believe, but there is also another factor at play. Amazon has been investing heavily in speeding up delivery times so that customers rely on the retailer more for last-minute needs like non-perishable foods and household and beauty items that typically are inexpensive compared to other categories of products like electronics or apparel. The company is winning share in consumables, but the low average cost per transaction is weighing on revenue.\n\nOn the bright side for the company, revenue growth inside the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business continues to reaccelerate. Sales growth in the unit accelerated to 18.8%, up from 17.1% in the first three months in the year, driven by customer spending both on Gen AI products and services as well as more traditional cloud infrastructure projects after a period of more cost-focused spending by AWS clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nJassy reiterated his revelation from last quarter that Gen AI is on pace to drive multiple billions of revenue for AWS this year. To get ahead of that, and other renewed cloud demand, Amazon is on pace to spend more on capital investments in the second half of the year than the $30.5 billion it doled out in the first six months of 2024. The massive cap ex spending is in line with rivals such Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta, which have all reported big increases on infrastructure investments in recent quarters.\n\nAmazon's investments, Olsavsky said, are being made to \"drive revenue and free cash flow for the next decade and beyond.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Markets Tumble on... Recession Fears? Plus AAPL, AMZN, INTC Earnings",
        "content": "Thursday, August 1st, 2024\r\n\r\nHere’s something we haven’t seen in a while. Markets sold off on fears of a recession today. After starting off across the board slightly in the green, the Dow slid -494 points, -1.2%, the Nasdaq -405 points, -2.3%, the S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000 -1.37% and -3.03%, respectively. The Fed passed on cutting rates yesterday, and we now must wait through seven weeks of data before the next chance to cut. Will it be too late?\r\n\r\nEconomic Outlook Slipping Rapidly?\r\n\r\nWith Weekly Jobless Claims this morning coming in higher than expected — and higher than we’ve seen in a year — and a fairly paltry private-sector payroll headline from ADP ADP on Wednesday, it’s possible we’re seeing the hit to the labor market analysts feared with keeping the Fed funds rate at 5.25-5.50% for the past year. It will be a minimum of 14 months at this peak by the time of the mid-September meeting; incidentally, that’s almost exactly how long rates stayed above 5% back in 2006-2007, prior to the mortgage-led financial crisis.\r\n\r\nLet’s reiterate the last time we saw jobless claims at these levels was exactly one year ago. Thus, the drop we’re seeing here may be at least somewhat seasonal in nature. That said, both ISM Manufacturing and Construction Spending came in lighter than expected for the month today, with downward revisions for previous prints. But we’ll remain agnostic on the economy falling for now; the big Employment Situation report comes out tomorrow (Friday) morning.\r\n\r\nApple (AAPL) Surprises Higher in Q3\r\n\r\nThe world’s biggest gadget-maker, Apple AAPL, has outperformed estimates in both top and bottom lines for the company’s fiscal Q3 report. Earnings of $1.40 per share pushed past the $1.34 in the Zacks consensus, on $85.78 billion in quarterly revenues, easily outpacing the $84.43 billion expected, amounting to +5% growth year over year. Apple only has one earnings miss in the last five years.\r\n\r\niPhone sales also surpassed expectations in Q3: $39.3 billion versus $38.8 billion anticipated. Apple’s services segment also climbed to $24.21 billion, better than the $24.01 billion analysts were looking for, +14% year over year. AAPL shares are up +2% in today’s after-market, adding to the +17% gains the stock has made year to date. The conference call is slated for 3pm Pacific Time this afternoon.\r\n\r\nAmazon (AMZN) Mixed in Q2, Down -5% Late\r\n\r\nFellow “Mag 7” stock Amazon AMZN posted a beat on its bottom line in Q2 — earnings of $1.26 per share versus $1.05 anticipated — while coming up short on the top line: $147.9 billion, compared with the $148.6 billion estimate. This, despite +19% growth in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in the quarter. However, a weak revenue guide for Q3 of $154-158.5 billion (the previous Zacks consensus of $158.2 billion is now at the high range of AMZN’s sales outlook) is helping move shares down -5% in the after-market, cutting into the company’s +22% gains year to date.\r\n\r\nIntel (INTC) Misses in Q2, Stock Slides -17%\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel INTC, missed revenue estimates again — $12.83 billion versus $12.92 billion expected — on only its third earnings miss in the past five years: $0.02 per share versus $0.10 projected. But what seems to be sending shares even lower in late trading is the slashed guidance for Q3: the company now sees earnings of 3 cents per share on $12.5-13.5 billion is revenues — well off the Zacks consensus 29 cents and $14.28 billion, respectively. Thje company also plans to lay off 15% of its workforce, most by the end of this year. This isn’t a good sign for future employment numbers in the tech sector.\r\n\r\nDoorDash (DASH) Dashes Ahead +15% on Q2 Sales\r\n\r\nSan Francisco-based “last mile” delivery service DoorDash (DASH) posted strong revenue numbers in its Q2 quarter after Thursday’s close. The company brought in $2.63 billion on the top line, for a new record high revenue quarter, above the $2.54 billion expected and +23% year over year. Although earnings in the quarter recorded a bigger miss than expected, this was largely due to two one-time items for the quarter. Total Orders and Marketplace GOV (its total value of orders) also rose to record highs in the quarter, helping the company more than double its year-to-date gains.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "First look: Amazon stock slides after projections for 3Q revenue",
        "content": "Amazon's projections of 3Q revenue were greeted with a thumbs down. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nAmazon’s earnings, released after the market close Thursday, were notable on several key points. Among them:\n\nWall Street’s reaction was decidedly negative. At about 4:40 p.m. EDT, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock was down about 4.4%, to $175.94. It had been down 1.56% on the day to $184.07. The decrease occurred even though its earnings per share under GAAP measurements of $1.26 beat consensus forecasts by 23 cts/share, according to SeekingAlpha. The negative stock market reaction was reported to be primarily driven by the company’s guidance. Amazon said it expected net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in the third quarter. But news reports said analysts had been forecasting third quarter net sales at $158.4 billion, citing Bloomberg data. One piece of data not in the earnings but will likely be in the company’s 10Q, yet to be filed, is a significant gain on its shares of electric vehicle maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), according to Tomi Kilgore of Marketwatch. Kilgore, in a commentary on Amazon’s earnings, noted that Amazon owns more than 158 million shares of Rivian Automotive Inc. That stock at the end of the second quarter was $13.42, up 22.6% from where it closed at the end of the first quarter, $10.95. Kilogore noted that Amazon did disclose earlier this week that its investments in publicly traded companies were $2.525 billion at the end of the quarter. That was up from $2.117 billion at the end of the first quarter, and  Rivian’s increase in price has been a key contributor to the rise in that asset line, according to Kilgore.\n\nAmong the operating highlights cited by Amazon in its prepared earnings statement, the company said it “delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever in the first half of the year.” Key measurements showed significant growth compared to the prior year. Net product sales for Amazon were up 4.3%. Net service sales, which includes AWS, rose 4.7%. Operating income was up 91% and consolidated net income almost doubled, to $13.5 billion. In North America, net sales exclusive of AWS rose to $90 billion from $82.5 billion. News reports said CFO Brian Olsavsky, in a conference call with reporters after the release of the earnings, said Amazon “did come in a little short on revenue growth in North America vs. our internal estimates.” According to the reports, the CFO said consumers were ratcheting down what they were willing to pay and were buying cheaper products. “What we’re seeing is really around ASP and lower ASP in products selected by customers,” Olsavsky said, according to the products. “They are continuing to be cautious in their spending and trading down to lower (average selling price) products.” AWS net sales jumped to $26.3 billion from $22.1 billion a year ago, and with operating expenses holding relatively steady, operating income climbed to $9.33 billion from $5.36 billion a year ago. In the prepared statement that had few quotes from management in it, AWS and its adoption of AI stood out. “We’re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,” Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon said. “As companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers’ top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nRyder, reporting sluggish earnings growth, sees ‘trough’ in freight market\n\nBacked by big companies and labor, Supply Chain Council debuts\n\nVictory for a 3PL again — TQL — in case involving broker liability\n\nThe post First look: Amazon stock slides after projections for 3Q revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Top 3 EV Charging Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "For many years, the electric vehicle (EV) industry, including EV charging stocks, has been plagued by two main adoption obstacles. Those include cars looking awkward and high upfront cost. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) largely changed the shift for the former. But battery costs are still exerting a heavy toll on people’s EV perception.\n\nNonetheless, fans of quiet driving and cheap upkeep continue to show up. S&P Global forecasted that battery electric vehicles (BEV) will see growth by nearly 40% in 2024 compared to 2023. Likewise, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasted global EV penetration to increase to 17% by the end of 2025, compared to tiny 2% in 2020.\n\nWhether that results as a pure play BEV like Tesla, its cheap BYD competition like Seagull, or Toyota-like hybrids, EVs will need a developed charging infrastructure.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce the cost of batteries decreases (Goldman says 40% by 2025 from end-2023), alongside new battery tech advances like solid-state, companies in charge of charging EVs are poised to balloon.\n\nThese three EV charging stocks have the best shot at rising.\n\nEVgo (EVGO) EVgo fast charging station\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNearly half of the U.S. population lives within a close distance of 10 miles from an EVgo (NASDAQ:EVGO) charging station. This EV infrastructure company runs an owner-operator business model, with over 1,000 fast-charging locations.\n\nSimilar to a software as a service (SaaS) model, EVgo offers four tiers of monetization. It starts with free Pay As You Go that charges 99 cents per session to EVgo PlusMax charging $12.99 monthly for frequent EV users. As owner-operator, EVgo is in control of its charging infrastructure, able to fine-tune the balance between user feedback and maintenance.\n\nSince fast-charging takes longer than filling up a fuel tank, the company routinely sets up collaborations with retail and commercial property owners. It aims to strategically position charging stations and increase traffic to partner businesses. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) partnership to leverage Alexa’s AI since January 2023. Also, BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY), Honda (NYSE:HMC) and GM (NYSE:GM) drivers are incentivized with EVgo credits.\n\nIn the latest Q1 of fiscal year 2024 earnings delivered in May, EVgo reported a record 118% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase to $55.2 million. The company’s charging network delivered 53 GWh of electricity, which is a 194% YOY increase. Although EVgo still reported a net loss of $28.2 million, it is a 43% YOY improvement over the net loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with added 109,000 accounts in the quarter, EVgo’s heavy capital expenditures are likely to start paying of in the near future. Presently priced at $3.62, EVGO stock is up 56% in the last six months.\n\nAbove the 52-week average of $2.86, EVGO shares still have some way to go to reach the 52-week high of $5.95 per share. Nasdaq’s forecasting consensus puts the average EVGO price target at $4.33 with $7 as the ceiling.\n\nEaton Corp. (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreatly diversified, Eaton Corp. (NYSE:ETN) is one of the safest EV charging stocks to buy. Not only does the company manufacture critical components for aerospace, both military and commercial, but also its end-to-end supply of electrical systems covers broader industrial and residential markets.\n\nIn addition to charging software, Eaton Corp. develops and deploys AC and DC chargers and facility’s power management systems. This includes home chargers like the compact Power Xpert EVX wallbox. In March, Eaton expanded with its launch of Green Motion DC fast chargers. These are able to simultaneously charge two vehicles at each side of the compact station.\n\nAhead of the Q2 earnings report on August 1st, Eaton Corp. beat four consecutive EPS estimates, with the Q1 earnings per share of $2.04 and adjusted EPS of $2.40. The company delivered 8% YOY organic sales growth and 27% backlog growth in the Electrical division.\n\nOf course, given the massive U.S. defense budget, Eaton Corp. also reported 11% aerospace growth. With a segment margins YOY improvement of 340 bp, and free cash flow increase by 40% to $292, Eaton Corp. makes a compelling investing case.\n\nOver the last six months, ETN stock is up, presently priced at $297.88, well-above the 52-week average and closing in on the 52-week high of $345.19. Nasdaq’s average ETN price target is $343.17 per share.\n\nWallbox N.V. (WBX) An iPhone screen with the Wallbox (WBX) logo on it in front of a computer screen.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs an exposure to Europe’s take on EV charging infrastructure, Spanish Wallbox N.V. (NYSE:WBX) represents a key player in the EV charging stocks market. It supplies the global market with fast and ultrafast chargers for both homes and public use.\n\nFor example, U.K.’s TopCharger magazine gave Pulsar Plus 4.2 stars out of five. Not only is it built with robustness in mind, but also it has wide connectivity. This includes Google Assistant and bluetooth/Wi-Fi to Apple Watch and Android Wear app.\n\nLike Eaton Corp., Wallbox N.V. released its Q2 earnings today. In the Q1 report, WBX delivered 23% more YOY sales, having improved realized gross margin by 600 bp after reducing the cost of labor and operating expenses at 21% and 30%, respectively. With the launch of Supernova 180 DC fast charger and Pulsar Pro in North America, Wallbox N.V. expects further growth.\n\nPresently priced at $1.46, WBX stock has one of the highest potential gains, making it the top EV charging stock to buy. While the current price is under the 52-week average of $1.78, Nasdaq’s forecasting consensus places average WBX price target at $4.13, with even the bottom of $3.25 indicating at least 2x gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Some, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, have already endorsed the Vice President, but now a new pledge is attracting more support. The names on it represent some of the most important and well-funded tech funds.\n\nWhile Reid Hoffman and entrepreneur Mark Cuban are at the top of the list, the VCsforKamala website shows over 100 venture capitalists signed up, including Chris Sacca, who has been a guest shark on Cuban's show \"Shark Tank.\" The VCsforKamala initiative was created by Seattle venture capitalist Leslie Feinzaig. The site defines those on the list as venture capital investors, founders, and tech leaders pledging their support for Harris. They describe themselves as pro-business, pro-American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro-technological progress. So far, the list has over 110 signatories representing approximately $150 billion in venture capital.\r\n\r\nDon't Miss Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nOne prestigious name on the list is Ron Conway, the head of SV Angel. Conway has been a venture investor since the 1990s. He was also a co-founder of Altos Computer Systems, taking the company public in 1982. SV Angel has invested in Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Asana (NYSE:ASAN), Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and dozens of other private and public companies.\n\nAlso on the list is Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures. He is a longtime entrepreneur and the founding CEO of Sun Microsystems. He formed Khosla Ventures in 2004 and searches for attractive for-profit and social impact companies. Some of the companies that Khosla Ventures invested in and exited include Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), DoorDash (NYSE:DASH), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), and Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST).\n\nAnother legend in the venture capital world who has signed his name is Brook Byers, a founder at Kleiner Perkins. Byers has been a venture capitalist since 1972, helping to build more than 60 companies. Kleiner Perkins has an alum list that spans some of the most successful companies of all time, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER).\n\nThere are many more investors on the list from large and small venture capital firms based not just in Silicon Valley but in cities all around the country. However, not everyone on the list has committed a large amount of campaign financing.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nNot all venture capitalists are on Harris' side of the aisle. Elon Musk has famously endorsed Trump. His fellow PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) alum Peter Thiel is reportedly on the fence, but Trump's selection of J.D. Vance has made him feel more sanguine about Trump. Other major investors who have declared for Trump include Bill Ackman of Pershing Square and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital, who donated $300,000 to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe founders of one of the world’s most prominent venture capital funds, Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, have endorsed former President Donald Trump. Andreessen Horowitz has been famously bullish on cryptocurrency and has backed many of Silicon Valley's biggest successes, including Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), as well as Meta, Airbnb, and others.\n\nAs we approach election day, we will likely see more tech luminaries on both sides. Those who favor Harris believe that she will be an ally to large tech companies because of her connections in California. Those who favor Trump believe that he could bring with him a new wave of deregulation that could benefit multiple industries.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Nvidia stock falls more than 7%, reversing Wednesday’s rally as chip stocks lead market lower",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped as much as 7% on Thursday as chip stocks led a tech-fueled sell-off amid signs of a cooling economy.\n\nShares of the AI chip heavyweight declined along with the rest of the Tech sector (XLK) after weak economic data released during the session sent the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield lower and stocks fell.\n\nThe stock decline was a reversal from the prior session's monster 13% rally after peer AMD (AMD) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance in a sign that investments in AI haven't slowed down.\n\n\"These hyperscalers ... their capital expenditures are high and potentially even rising into 2025. So this bodes incredibly well for Nvidia,” said Harvest Portfolio Management co-chief investment officer Paul Meeks on Thursday.\n\nNvidia doesn't reveal who its largest customers are, but according to Bloomberg data, Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) account for more than 40% of Nvidia's top line.\n\nMicrosoft makes up roughly 19% of the AI chipmaker's revenue, according to Bloomberg data. This week the tech giant revealed capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30.\n\nMicrosoft said it expects to increase its infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025 more than it did in 2024.\n\n\"The fear of potentially some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so — I think is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\n\nSocial media giant Meta, which accounts for roughly 10% of Nvidia's revenue, per Bloomberg data, said it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025 after posting strong results on Wednesday.\n\nChip peers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI), also sank on Thursday in a reversal from the prior session. Semiconductor stocks fell on Thursday, erasing gains from the prior session.\n\nThe chip sector as a whole has benefited from the AI frenzy, but Nvidia is seen as the main beneficiary, up roughly 130% year to date. Rival AMD is down roughly 9% since the start of the year.\n\n\"Over time, the pie will get bigger. I still think that Nvidia will have most of the slices, and AMD ... they’ll be a good second supplier. But NVDIA will have a hold on this market for as far as the eye can see,\" said Meeks.\n\nOn Wednesday Morgan Stanley's analysts led by Joseph Moore placed Nvidia on their 'Top Pick' list after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia — spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries — but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\n\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\n\nThe company is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Instead of Bank of America",
        "content": "Recent regulatory filings made by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) revealed that the holding company reduced its stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for the first time since 2019. Even the most favored of Warren Buffett stocks aren’t immune from a little profit-taking.\n\nOver three separate days in July, Berkshire sold 33.9 million shares of BAC stock for proceeds of nearly $1.5 billion and an average selling price of $43.56. According to WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire paid an average price of $25.68 for BAC shares. That indicates Buffett’s pre-tax profit was approximately $630 million.\n\nThat’s some gain, but then again, that’s what we’ve become accustomed to with Berkshire’s equity portfolio. Despite the sale, Bank of America remains Berkshire’s second-largest position accounting for 9.5% of its $398 billion portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBAC isn’t the only stock Berkshire should probably trim. However, I’m more interested in the Warren Buffett stocks the holding company should be adding to in 2024.\n\nHere are my three choices straight from CNBC’s Berkshire portfolio tracker.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 0.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio. It owns 10.0 million shares, or 0.1% of the Seattle company.\n\nBuffett often talks about how he missed an opportunity to buy Amazon stock early on in the company’s history. In 1994, when it was just a bookstore, he was given the opportunity to buy. He said no. He did again three years later in 1997 when it became public.\n\nIn 2019, before Berkshire bought Amazon stock, Buffett admitted that he missed the opportunity because, in his head, he couldn’t move from the bookselling business model to something more diversified and technologically driven.\n\n“I’d always admired Jeff,” Buffett told Yahoo Finance editor Andy Serwer. “I mean, I met him 20 years ago or so, and I thought he was something special, but I didn’t realize you could go from books to what’s happened there.”\n\nThanks to the company’s largest position, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Buffett knows a lot more about tech stocks, which should help him evaluate all the different revenue streams Amazon has and the potential new ones down the road.\n\nMitsubishi (MSBHF) Mitsubishi Motors Canadian headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF) is one of the five Japanese trading houses in which Berkshire first invested $6 billion in August 2020. He could not believe he could invest in these historic businesses.\n\n“I just thought these were big companies. They were companies that I generally understood what they did. Somewhat similar to Berkshire in that they owned lots of different interests,” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick in April 2023. “And they were selling at what I thought was a ridiculous price, particularly the price compared to the interest rates prevailing at that time.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHe boosted the holding company’s stakes in all five in April 2023. It now owns 8.6% of Mitsubishi, the largest ownership stake of the five; it accounts for 1.8% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio. The others account for 1.5%, 1.4%, 0.7% and 0.6%.\n\nHe said in 2023 he would consider buying more. That’s a smart move.\n\nA friend of mine from high school worked at the Canadian arm of Mitsubishi’s auto business after university. He stayed there for years and used to tell me about all the different businesses the parent company was into.\n\nIf there’s a business that Buffett understands backward and forward, it is the conglomerate, which is precisely what these trading houses are.\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) is one of the three big credit ratings companies along with S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch Group is owned 100% by privately held Hearst Corp.\n\nMoody’s is Berkshire’s eighth-largest holding accounting for 2.9% of the holding company’s equity portfolio. Its $11.3 billion stake represents 13.5% of Moody’s stock.\n\nBerkshire first bought MCO stock in Q4 2000. It owned 24 million shares as of Dec. 31, 2000. They were valued at approximately $617 million at the end of 2000. Today it owns 24.67 million, so it’s added about 670,000 shares over 24 years. That’s not much.\n\nIt reported Q2 2024 results on July 23. Revenues were up 22% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, while its earnings per share jumped 47% to $3.02. As a result, it raised its full-year EPS estimate to $11.20 at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nIts stock isn’t cheap at about 42x its 2024 earnings but you have to pay for quality.\n\nFurther, based on its trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.09 billion and an enterprise value of $28.65 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 7.3%. Anything above 8% is value territory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Top 3 Tech Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "That tech stocks have been the driving force behind the two-year bull market is no surprise. It was the Magnificent Seven stocks that represented most of the S&P 500’s 24% gains last year. Most of those companies are repeating their performance in 2024, if not quite to the same degree.\n\nHowever, after hitting a new record high two weeks ago, the benchmark index started to peel back from those gains. Mostly, it was the result of investors selling off some of the top tech stocks and rotating into small-cap names.\n\nYet it remains that tech stocks are pushing stock earnings higher. According to FactSet (NYSE:FDS), of all 11 stock sectors, technology is reporting the highest earnings growth rates in the second quarter. And it is semiconductors with 25% growth and software at 12% that are responsible for the lion’s share of the gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf we drill down into individual stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unsurprisingly the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. It is expected to report earnings of 64 cents per share, a 137% increase over the 27 cents per share it notched last year.\n\nExclude the AI chipmaker, though, and tech stocks are suddenly seeing much more mundane increases. Yet the three top tech stocks below represent excellent opportunities to buy right now.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just reported fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results. While it beat Wall Street estimates for revenue and earnings, certain segments came up a little short. Unfortunately, they are the most important to Microsoft’s future growth, and that has some investors worried. They shouldn’t be.\n\nThe software giant, which is now also a leading artificial intelligence stock, saw revenue of $64.7 billion, up 16% in currency adjusted dollars. Its Azure cloud services, which has quickly transformed into one of the biggest drivers of Microsoft’s business, was up 30% on an adjusted basis. The freak-out by the market is because last year segment sales grew 31%.\n\nSimilarly, its enterprise software operations were up 12% year-over-year versus a 13% increase last year. But the sky is not falling.\n\nAlthough Azure is second to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS cloud business, it has several key advantages. Because Microsoft offers hybrid cloud hosting, it allows clients to choose whether they want to keep data on-premises or in the cloud. It also lets them choose which data and how fast they migrate it to the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft stock is down 11% from its recent all-time high but investors should view that as a buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor stockAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also just reported earnings and apparently all a chipmaker needs these days is AI. Despite overall growth slowing and gaming revenue tumbling 59% from last year, AMD’s data center segment that houses the AI business witnessed 115% growth.\n\nYet this is what investors have been expecting and waiting for all along. The chipmaker was behind Nvidia in developing AI chips. It basically started from nothing a year ago but has been making up for lost time.\n\nIts AI accelerators outperform Nvidia’s standard data center chips, and though AMD’s rival is continually advancing the technology to improve speed and efficiency, AMD’s chips have the benefit of being cheaper.\n\nThat seems to be resonating with customers. Data center revenue climbed to $2.8 billion on the steep ramp in Instinct MI300 GPU shipments. Strong growth in fourth-generation EPYC CPUs also helped push sales up. CEO Lisa Su said, “The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market.”\n\nThis is not a one-off event. AMD hinted at it in the first quarter but the market sold off AMD stock. That didn’t happen this time as shares rose 4% but with a huge runway in front of it, this chipmaker is one to buy now.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst all the hoopla over AI, analog integrated circuits are often forgotten about. Yet they remain integral to the workings of virtually all computers and electronic devices. Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) remains one of the leading analog IC manufacturers. An inventory glut following the pandemic slowed business growth and caused sales to slow, but that is coming to an end.\n\nSecond-quarter sales fell 16% year-over-year but were up 4% sequentially. Texas Instruments told investors earlier this year business would improve going forward and it is beginning to play out. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry but over time revenue tends to grow. We are entering an upcycle now.\n\nBecause analog chips are used for uploading and downloading audio, video and image files, they are found in smartphones, digital camera, appliances and automobiles. Its their ubiquity, but under-the-radar nature, that makes them an attractive long-term investment.\n\nTXN stock has generated returns of more than 450% to investors over the past decade. Shares are up 20% year-to-date but there is plenty more long-term upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon to report second quarter earnings with AWS sales and AI spending in spotlight",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to post quarterly earnings after the bell on Thursday, wrapping a wave of Big Tech results that have flashed warnings that investors have limited patience for massive AI spending.\n\nThe company is expected to offer updates on the progress of its AI initiatives, the growth of its lucrative cloud business, and the build-out of its advertising segment.\n\nAmazon's report will arrive days after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) posted lower than expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors running.\n\nMeta (META), on the other hand, earned the applause of Wall Street, delivering better than expected results for revenue and profit, even as executives warned they anticipate \"significant\" capital expenditures in 2025. Shares were up 10% Thursday morning. Apple (AAPL) will round out earnings from the major tech platforms after the closing bell.\n\nThe mixed reactions to the reports so far highlight the evolution of the AI trade. It is no longer enough to commit massive resources to ambitious AI initiatives. Investors and analysts are now looking for returns on those investments, or in place of new revenue streams, more details about when major spending will start to pay off.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Amazon’s most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue: $148.8 billion expected ($134.4 billion in Q2 2023) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.04 expected (65 cents in Q2 2023) Amazon Web Services: $26 billion expected ($22.1 billion in Q2 2023) Advertising: $13 billion expected ($10.7 billion in Q2 2023)\n\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters last quarter that overall capital expenditures are expected to \"meaningfully\" increase this year from nearly $50 billion in 2023, driven by higher infrastructure costs to support growth in AWS.\n\nThe company sees the potential for AI initiatives to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. Customers have been signing up for longer AWS deals with bigger commitments, many with generative AI components, executives have said. Analysts expect benefits from Amazon's annual Prime Day event to be a boost to the company's outlook. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn a note ahead of earnings, Bank of America Global Research analysts said they expect a second quarter that exceeds expectations for revenue and operating profit, owing to accelerating demand for AWS services and AI features, the potential ramp up of Prime Video ads, and an outlook boost from Prime Day benefits.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan pointed to AWS’s growth trajectory and the advertising segment’s contributions among Amazon’s strengths.\n\nLast quarter, advertising revenue swelled by 24%. AWS sales jumped by 16%, and executives said the business line is on track to generate $100 billion annually. Both segments are expected to grow again by double digit percentages.\n\nAmazon, which has positioned itself as an AI leader, is another player in the arms race to claim AI market share and launch new enterprise and consumer services. But the mood around AI investments has shifted in recent days. Coming off lackluster results from cloud and AI leaders, Wall Street has adopted a more discerning stance toward AI spending.\n\nBut analysts say Amazon is well positioned to capitalize on the AI transition. As the biggest player in the cloud industry, Amazon Web Services claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition from the likes of Temu and Shein, companies that specialize in low cost goods that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a low-cost digital storefront of its own, to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending. It’s possible Amazon will offer an update on those efforts as it works to defend its online shopping empire.\n\nAmazon's earnings report will arrive just a day after the conclusion of the Fed's July policy meeting, when officials kept interest rates unchanged but signaled that the first cut is on the table for their next meeting in September. The timing of an eventual easing cycle will impact Amazon and other major tech stocks, which have powered 2024's equity rally.\n\nInvestors are also looking out for a dividend surprise. Amazon is the last remaining Big Tech company to refrain from offering one, as Meta, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL) recently announced or expanded their shareholder return programs.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Apple, Amazon Results Are Crucial for Nasdaq 100’s Next Leg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Earnings from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. will be critical to give direction to the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by some of the benchmark’s worst — and best — days this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished\n\nThe pair are the last megacaps to release results until Nvidia Corp. at the end of August, and will set the tone for tech investors for the coming month. The reports, due after the close, will be scrutinized for how artificial intelligence is driving growth for Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and how the new technology is expected to boost demand for the next iPhone. They’ll also give investors some insight into the health of consumer spending.\n\nApple is under pressure to give more information about expected demand for its next iPhone models, which will include AI. The shares have rallied 15% since the firm unveiled long-awaited new AI features in June, and 28% since last quarter’s estimate-beating results, even after the recent rotation out of the tech sector. Amazon shares are up 23% this year.\n\nAfter those runups, “it feels like the energy could be much more to the downside if people want to continue to rebalance their portfolios and take profits,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. Any signs of weakness, especially in forecasts from the two companies, could be punished by investors, he said.\n\nStill, some analysts think that what Apple says about future iPhone sales and AI will be more important than this quarter’s numbers.\n\n“We expect iPhone commentary to be the key catalyst this quarter with bullish statements about iPhone 16 expectations and continued stability in China likely to drive shares higher,” wrote Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani. New AI features, plus the “sizable portion” of iPhone users due for an upgrade, should spark a demand cycle from the December quarter through 2025, they added.\n\nRead: Apple’s AI iPhone Turns Skeptics Into Bulls and Raises Stakes\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report revenue of $84.5 billion in the quarter, up around 3% from the same time last year and returning to growth after a slip in the previous quarter.\n\nAI will also be front and center for Amazon. It’s the last of the hyperscalers to release results and follows Microsoft Corp. reporting slower growth in its Azure unit. The Amazon Web Services cloud business is expected to generate sales of nearly $26 billion in the quarter, growing more than 17% year-over-year. Amazon’s overall second-quarter revenue is expected to increase 11% to $148.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Given GenAI tailwinds, we believe AWS revenue growth likely accelerated in 2Q,” Citi analysts led by Ronald Josey wrote in a note. They also expect a beat for operating income given improved efficiencies in retail and continued strong advertising demand.\n\nAmazon’s results will also be an indicator on the strength of US consumer spending.\n\n“We’ve heard a lot of mixed reports this earnings season about how the consumer is doing. And let’s face it, there is a fair amount of discretion in the purchases that flow into Amazon’s core retail business,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. McDonald’s Corp. this week reported its first sales drop in four years as diners cut back, while Starbucks Corp. same-store sales also fell.\n\nRetail margin expansion has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and shares in the last year and a half, Stucky added. “That’s just as big if not bigger driver for Amazon’s ongoing profitability than what AI’s doing in the AWS space,” he said.\n\nOperating margin for the North America segment is expected to come in at around 5.8% in the second quarter — up significantly from last year — and continue to expand through the rest of the year. That excludes AWS, which has much higher operating margins.\n\nTruist analyst Youssef Squali also pointed to Amazon’s retail strength, along with AWS, as a key focus in the report.\n\n“Amid a weakening consumer, Amazon continues to gain share of global e-commerce and improve its value proposition to both merchants and consumers,” Squali wrote in note, reiterating his buy rating. “We see multiple growth vectors powering Amazon’s growth which keeps the stock compelling.”\n\nAnd any change in tone on capital returns — as we highlighted last week — could also keep shares going. With a cash hoard that’s expected to top $100 billion this year, conditions have never been more favorable for the firm to join megacap peers in returning cash.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp.’s wild ride this week is headed for the record books. The world’s third-most-valuable company added a record $329 billion in value on Wednesday — obliterating the single-day record that it has repeatedly set in the past few months. The gains came a day after a 7% rout and as peer Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMeta Plaforms Inc. reported better-than-expected sales in the second quarter, signaling that the company’s investments in AI are helping it sell more targeted ads. Shares gained in pre-market trading. Applied Materials Inc. was informed by US officials that it won’t be receiving Chips Act money for a long-anticipated research and development center, dealing a critical blow to a much-touted project in the heart of Silicon Valley. Qualcomm Inc., the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, saw a post-market rally sputter on Wednesday, fueled by concerns that the phone market is recovering more slowly than investors had hoped. Arm Holdings Plc shares tumbled in late trading after the chip company held off on boosting its annual forecast, raising concerns that it’s not confident in future growth prospects. The US is considering unilateral restrictions on China’s access to AI memory chips and equipment capable of making those semiconductors as soon as next month, a move that would further escalate the tech rivalry between the world’s biggest economies.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nInsight Enterprises Macom Arrow Electronics Vontier Corp Allegro MicroSystems Itron ACI Worldwide Belden InterDigital Lightspeed Commerce Inc BigCommerce BCE Roblox Sirius XM Criteo Altice USA Gannett Co Thryv Holdings Inc Bandwidth Marcus Corp Postmarket\n\nApple Intel Snap Roku Cable One Skillz Inc Motorola Solutions Microchip Atlassian Monolithic Power MicroStrategy Cloudflare CoreCard GoDaddy Gen Digital Universal Display Procore Technologies Twilio Open Text Altair Eng Marathon Digital Holding Workiva RingCentral Mirion Technologies Silicon Motion Sprout Social Corsair Gaming OneSpan Inc Bigbear.ai\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Because They Are Brands Consumers Love",
        "content": "Consumer-centric brands often focus, and thrive, off of one thing–the amount of money or time (depending on the business model used) users spend on it. As consumers, we can agree that when we find a brand we like, we stick with it until something changes. This may include skincare, personal finance, or even investing! While there are many such companies out there, what’s important is that we single out companies. We do so based on future viability, current status, and the potential to make great returns for readers. As for our readers, they want to hear about the top stocks to buy, which is where this list comes in handy.\n\nHere are three companies that I believe will offer you a great starting off point.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the world’s most recognizable coffee joints. Starting from a humble store in Pike’s Place Market, in Seattle, this giant is now the world’s third-largest restaurant chain. It is trading at a valuation of $77.95 as of market close on Wednesday, July 31st. Analyst expectations suggest an implied upside of over 10% at this price point.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSBUX has met revenue estimates for the last quarter, which is a positive sign given the fact that it had missed estimates for the two quarters preceding this one. However, revenue and earnings have fallen year-over-year. While this can be attributed to many factors, inflationary pressure and public backlash over the situation in Gaza, and how management handled it, are key concerns.\n\nAs inflationary pressures and the conflict subside, I expect a significant uptick in total revenue and a growth in same-store sales. This will likely propel SBUX stock to new heights, making early investors proud. This is definitely a consumer-centric brand to invest in, and one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company known for its e-commerce platform, cloud computing (AWS), Prime membership, consumer electronics (like Kindle and Echo), digital content, logistics and delivery services, and physical stores such as Amazon Go and Whole Foods Market.\n\nAMZN stock is currently trading at $186.98 as of the market close on 07/31/24 with a market cap of $1.94 trillion. The company’s business model is profitable. The stock saw profit and operating margins of 6.38% and 10.68% respectively. The company’s revenue has grown by $60.8 billion over the past year. Furthermore, the company has a year-on-year (YOY) quarterly revenue growth rate of 12.50%. Amazon Prime’s membership base has surpassed 200 million subscribers globally, contributing significantly to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon’s earnings report is due to come out today (08/01/2024), and analysts are predicting sales to reach $148.7 billion, marking a 10.7% increase over the same period last year. A significant focus of this earnings report will be AI, since its central to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing unit. AWS has been a major growth driver for Amazon, with almost 16% of the company’s revenue coming from AWS. Given these factors, Amazon’s strong fundamentals and growth potential make it a compelling stock to buy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) formerly known as Facebook, Inc., is a global tech company operating social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It also invests heavily in VR and AR through Oculus and the development of the metaverse for immersive digital experiences.\n\nMETA stock has been up 3% since yesterday after a positive earnings report and is predicted to rise even more today. The company has reported an earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was 9.3% higher than the consensus estimate of $4.72. The company has seen a YOY quarterly earnings growth rate of 116%, which is impressive considering that revenue only grew by 27% in the same period. Meta has a target price estimate of $523.30, which suggests a growth potential of 10.2% over the next year.\n\nThe company has an operating cash flow of $76.36 billion, suggesting that Meta generates substantial cash from its core business operations and that it can invest in growth opportunities or return value to shareholders through dividends or share buyback. Overall, it’s the company’s strong fundamentals and high profitability, which make META stock one of the definite consumer stocks to buy\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Top 3 Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "After years of volatility, investors are embracing small-cap companies leading to a strong surge in Russell 2000 stocks in the last month.\n\nIt’s been a go big or go home mentality in the stock market this year with tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) driving much of the gains. However, there’s been a recent shift in gears as investors turn to small-cap companies for returns.\n\nThe Russell 2000 ETF which tracks the Russell 2000 Index (an index for small-cap stocks) surged 12% in the last month. According to experts, the gains were driven by expectations of interest rate cuts, an improving inflationary environment, and the valuations of large-cap stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut how high can the Russell 2000 go? Well while the index is still down 8% from its 2021 highs, many believe the rally will be sustained. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes the index could go as high as 40% by the end of the summer. DataTrek says investor sentiment gives the index more room to run.\n\nGiven the glowing optimism, Russell 2000 stocks stand out as top buys in the market right now. Here’s a look at three companies to add to your portfolio.\n\nAbercrombie and Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nEveryone likes a good comeback story and that’s exactly what Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF) stock offers. The 90s fashion brand has seen a reversal in fortunes fueled by a strategic rebranding to make the brand more inclusive.\n\nA&F shed its preppy image to opt for a quality-focus label that caters to a wider range of preferences and body types. This was accompanied by a rise in efficiency that helped the company reclaim its position in the fashion industry.\n\nThe success of its efforts was evident in its last earnings report. The company reported net income of $113.9 million for the period, nearly seven times higher than a year ago. Revenue came in at $1.02 billion over the estimated $963 million while sales grew 22% YoY. A&F attributes this growth to better inventory control, marketing efforts, and agile chase capabilities. For the full year, it expects sales to rise by 10%.\n\nANF stock is up 66% this year and the company shows no signs of slowing down. Its rosy outlook and successful rebranding efforts make this stock a worthy investment. A&F is also a part of the Russell 2000 stocks and could see a boost from a decline in interest rates.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-learning has always remained a high-growth industry and Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) dominates the market for learning languages online. The company’s freemium platform has amassed a loyal following of  97 million monthly active users. This includes 7.4 million paying subscribers. This resulted in impressive gains for the company in the last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income for the period grew to $27 million, a significant incline from the $2.6 million loss a year ago. Revenue and bookings grew 45% and 41% respectively. For the upcoming quarter, Duolingo provided optimistic guidance and anticipates a 39% growth in revenue YoY in the $175 million to $177.5 million range\n\nThe growth will be fueled by several key factors. This includes an expansion into new verticals such as physics and math to widen its competitive moat. Along with a deeper monetization of its free users through in-app purchases. Duolingo’s total user base represents just a fraction of its target market, giving the e-learning platform plenty of room to grow in the long haul.\n\nDUOL 20% this year presents a great buying opportunity ahead of the anticipated rally in Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (SFM) An exterior sign on a Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) store in Granada Hills, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe rise in demand for healthy food served as a boon for Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM). The health-focused grocery chain experienced strong growth in rising demand for its highly differentiated products. It hits the sweet spot for healthy groceries with its high-quality products at competitive prices. This translated to exceptional earnings in its second quarter as it breezed past analyst expectations.\n\nThe company saw a 6.7% uptick in comparable sales growth and earnings of 91 cents per share over the estimated 78 cents. Quarterly sales also grew to $1.89 billion surpassing an estimate of $1.83 billion. An additional five locations were opened during the period bringing the total store count to 419. Looking to Q3, Sprouts anticipates earnings between $0.71 and $0.75 per share. Full-year net sales are expected to grow by 9% to 10%.\n\nAccording to its CEO, the growth was the result of its assortment of health products and unique in-store experience. Grocery chains remain one of the least penetrated categories in e-commerce so a great in-store experience is key to driving gains. This is something Sprouts has mastered.\n\nLooking at the big picture, Sprouts’ strong financials and growth prospects signal plenty of upside in the long haul. This is one of the top Russell 2000 stocks to get behind this summer for lucrative returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "4 Top Tech Stocks to Buy on Soaring Hopes of September Rate Cut",
        "content": "Wall Street rebounded on Jul 31, led by a tech rally, as investors now strongly believe that the Federal Reserve will implement its first interest rate cut in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 1.6% to end at 5,522.30, while the Nasdaq rose 2.6% to close at 17,599.40. Both the indexes recorded their best session since February. The Dow also rose 0.2% to finish at 40,842.79 points.\n\nThe rebound came as the Federal Reserve, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, kept interest rates unchanged in the current range of 5.25-5.5%. A small section of market participants was hopeful that the Fed could start its interest rate cuts in July but that didn’t happen.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve Chairman, in his first press conference after the end of the July FOMC meeting, said that if data gives central bank officials the confidence that inflation is easing steadily, it could start its easing cycle.\n\n“If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell said.\n\nInflation has declined substantially over the past couple of months after rising in the first quarter. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s key inflation gauge, rose 0.1% sequentially in June, which was in line with economists’ expectations.\n\nYear over year, PCE rose 2.5% in June after increasing 2.6% in May. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2% month over month in June and 2.6% year over year.\n\nAlso, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter, double the pace from the first quarter and sharply higher than economists’ expectations of a rise of 2%.\n\nMarket participants are now confident that the Federal Reserve will start its easing cycle with a 25-basis point rate cut in September followed by two more by the end of this year. Lower borrowing rates typically help growth-oriented assets like technology stocks. Moreover, tech stocks have been driving the market rally since 2023.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN,Apple, Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Netflix, Inc. NFLX that have strong potential for 2024.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 58.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 60 days. APPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 106.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 30 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 58.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 4.2% over the past 60 days.

        "title": "Fed guidance, BOE, Meta's results, Apple - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged but signaled the possibility of a cut next month. The Bank of England has that decision to make later in the session. Meta Platforms impressed with its quarterly earnings, and Apple is next up after the close.\n\n1. Fed lifts September rate cut confidence\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its latest policy-setting meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected, but acknowledged recent progress on inflation, raising investor hopes that the central bank could begin cutting rates in the near future.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, kept its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as it has done over the past year as it battled elevated inflation.\n\nHowever, recent data point to progress on inflation, suggesting that the Fed's restrictive policies are working.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,\" the Fed said Wednesday in its July policy statement, with the addition of the word “somewhat” marking a subtle change from its June statement.\n\nA September rate cut of 25 basis points is now almost fully priced in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, but traders also added to bets the Federal Reserve will go big when it does cut.\n\nRate futures prices now reflect about a 17% chance of a 50-basis point rate cut in September, versus about 5% before Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nThe Fed also acknowledged a cooling in the labor market, stating that the committee is \"attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate\" - to maintain stable prices and strive for maximum employment.\n\nFriday sees the release of the closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report, as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\n2. Futures steady after Fed meeting\n\nU.S. stock futures traded in a steady manner Thursday, as investors digested the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as more corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 45 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed higher Wednesday, with the S&P 500 gaining 16%, its best day since February, the Nasdaq Composite surging 2.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%.\n\nThese gains followed the Fed signaling that a rate cut could occur in September if inflation continues to cool.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) [see below] and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEconomic data due for release Thursday includes weekly jobless claims data, construction spending for June and ISM Manufacturing data for July, ahead of Friday’s widely-watched monthly jobs report.\n\n3. Meta soars after impressive Q2\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reported strong second-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, bucking the recent trend of poorly received results from the country’s mega cap tech companies.\n\nMeta Platforms, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue, seeing quarterly growth of 22%.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts on a call that the company was \"continuing to see healthy global advertising demand\", benefiting from its plans to use artificial intelligence to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\n\nThe tech giant also issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial-intelligence investments.\n\nAlthough Meta's costs rose 7% in the second quarter, its revenue jump topped expense growth substantially and led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, to 38% from 29%.\n\nMeta stock soared over 7% after hours, contrasting with the losses that both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered when they released these numbers over the last few days.\n\n4. Apple revenue to bounce back in Q3\n\nIt’s Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) turn to face the judgment of investors, as the iPhone maker releases its fiscal third-quarter results after the close Thursday.\n\nApple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, bouncing back after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter, as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple in May offered hefty discounts on select iPhone models, helping narrow sales declines in the country.\n\nElsewhere, iPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for this product line.\n\nApple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.\n\n5. Bank of England to cut?\n\nThe Bank of England completes this week’s round of central bank rate decisions later Thursday, after the Bank of Japan delivered its second interest rate hike in 17 years and the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted it could lower rates in September after standing pat.\n\nThe moves, or lack of them, by the BOJ and the Fed were largely expected, but there is greater uncertainty than usual of the Bank of England's meeting as key policymakers have not spoken publicly for more than two months in the run-up to the country’s general election in early July.\n\nThe Bank of England has held its benchmark interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the past year as it tackled inflation, which soared to a 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nU.K. consumer price inflation returned to the BOE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, suggesting a cut later Thursday is a distinct possibility.\n\nIn June, the MPC voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the meeting recorded that several of those who voted to hold had been close to voting for a cut.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed guidance, BOE, Meta's results, Apple - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ sees chance wages, inflation could overshoot\n\nAnalysis-BOJ governor's hawkish streak signals more hikes to come\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among the Top Stock Bets of a $3 Billion Hedge Fund?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of $3 Billion Hedge Fund’s Top 10 Stock Bets. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stock bets by a $3 billion hedge fund.\n\nCinctive Capital Management is a hedge fund specializing in long/short equity strategies. Based in New York City's Hudson Yards, its founders and industry veterans, Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, aim to redefine the multi-manager model with an evolved approach to portfolio management. The firm provides a multi-manager investment platform to its investors combining fundamental stock picking with proprietary quantitative tools with a focus on scrupulous risk management practices to ensure robust investment strategies. According to Schimel, “Cinctive is the evolution of the experiences Larry and I had over the past two decades.”\n\nRichard Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski founded Cinctive Capital Management in 2019. Since its inception, the hedge fund's assets have nearly quadrupled. Sapanski and Schimel have worked together for 14 years. Back in 2005, Larry also co-founded Diamondback Capital, managing significant assets in financials, energy, bonds, and macro strategies. In the early 2000s, Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski worked for Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. They founded Diamondback Capital Management in 2005, which managed $5.8 billion in assets. However, the firm closed in 2012 due to client withdrawals following a non-prosecution agreement related to an insider trading investigation. However, the government later dropped the agreement and Diamondback was refunded the $9 million after the conviction was tossed out.\n\nIn addition to managing and founding Cinctive Capital Management and the aforementioned ventures, both the Co-Founders and Co-CIOs have held many distinctive roles in the past. Richard Schimel was a Senior Managing Director and Head of Aptigon Capital at Citadel. He also served as Chief Investment Officer at Sterling Ridge Capital Management, which he founded in 2013. Schimel holds a B.A. in Economics from the University of Michigan. Larry Sapanski also brings over 30 years of investment management experience to the Cinctive family. Larry Sapanski paved a similar path for himself like his fellow Richard Schimel before co-founding Cinctive. He started a hedge fund called Scoria Capital (2013-2017) where he served as CIO, overseeing trading, risk exposures, and a best ideas portfolio. Larry Sapanski has held various trading roles at London Bishopgates International, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley. Sapanski graduated from St. John's University with a B.S. in Accounting.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the Form ADV filed on March 2024, Cinctive Capital Management disclosed that they are serving 8 clients with discretionary assets under management totaling $3,019,428,000. Their most recent 13F filing for Q4 2023 revealed managed 13F securities amounting to $1,505,809,649, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 17.76%.\n\nCurrently, Cinctive Capital Management has been successful in betting on artificial intelligence in energy, technology, and utility sector-related stocks as it ended the first half of the year gaining 11%. Its performance has also been noteworthy while betting in other sectors such as Financials, healthcare, and biotech thereby beating other big multi-strategy hedge funds, such as Citadel and Millennium. The successful track record at Diamondback has allowed Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski to draw noteworthy interest from institutional investors for their venture, Cinctive Capital Management. This achievement comes despite the broader hedge fund industry's increased scrutiny from investors over subpar returns.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Cinctive Capital Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Schimel and Sapanski's top 5 stock picks returned an average of 11% since the end of the first quarter, vs. 4% gain for the broader indices for large-cap stocks.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nReturn since Q1 End: 0.7%\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported robust results in Q1 of 2024 and generated revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Recently, Needham restated a “Buy” rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $205. Analysts’ median price target of $220 represents an upside of 11% from current levels.\n\nRegulatory filings show that Cinctive Capital Management owned 140,892 shares in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the first quarter of 2024 worth $25 million, representing 1.18% of the portfolio.\n\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, First Pacific Advisors LLC is a leading shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with 5 million shares worth more than $239 million.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its May 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to a $3 billion hedge fund. You can visit $3 Billion Hedge Fund’s Top 10 Stock Betsto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Covariant, a maker of artificial intelligence software used in industrial robots, received recent takeover interest from Amazon.com Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon and Covariant declined to comment. Founded in 2017, Covariant has raised $245 million from investors including Index Ventures and Radical Ventures, and it was valued at $625 million in a 2023 funding round, according to PitchBook.\n\nAmazon has been a leader in warehouse automation since its 2012 acquisition of Kiva Systems, which makes robots that roam vast warehouses, fetching products and helping fulfill online orders more swiftly. Covariant’s customers include online retailer Otto Group, logistics firm Radial and pharmaceutical distributor McKesson Corp., which use the company’s software in warehouses, according to its website.\n\nCovariant would be an attractive takeover target for Amazon because its software would provide a single platform, enabling robots from different companies to communicate with one another and be managed in a centralized fashion, said Brittain Ladd, a logistics industry consultant and former Amazon executive. “It’s basically a way for Amazon to power all of their automation through one platform,” Ladd said.\n\nAmazon has been examining other options to enhance its warehouse automation beyond Kiva robots. The Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund in December led a $3.2 million investment in Instock, another warehouse robotics firm. Amazon also invested in Agility Robotics Inc. in 2022 and participated in a July investment in startup Standard Bots.\n\nCovariant Chief Executive Officer Peter Chen co-founded the company while working as an electrical engineering and computer science researcher at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

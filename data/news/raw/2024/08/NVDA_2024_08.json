        "title": "Super Micro Computer's Stock Sinks: Time to Buy or Sell?",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, was one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks this year. Its shares closed at a record high of $1,188.07 on March 13, representing a 2,760% gain over the previous two years, as its sales of dedicated AI servers skyrocketed.\n\nBut as of this writing, Supermicro's stock trades at $424. Four issues caused that slide: concerns about its declining gross margins, troubling allegations from a prolific short-seller, a delayed filing of the company's annual report, and Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) decelerating sales growth. Let's see if investors should buy or avoid this fallen AI stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bull case for Supermicro\n\nSupermicro controls a smaller slice of the server market than Dell Technologies or Hewlett Packard Enterprise, but it carved out a niche with its high-performance liquid-cooled servers. That strategy made Supermicro an ideal partner for Nvidia, which provided the company with a steady supply of its high-end data center GPUs.\n\nAs a result, Supermicro's sales of dedicated AI servers skyrocketed as the rapid expansion of the AI market drove many companies to upgrade their data centers. The company's revenue rose only 7% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in June 2021) but surged 46% in fiscal 2022, 37% in fiscal 2023, and 110% in fiscal 2024 as those AI tailwinds kicked in. Analysts expect its revenue to grow another 89% in fiscal 2025 and 12% in fiscal 2026.\n\nBank of America estimates that Supermicro already controls 10% of the dedicated server market, and it expects it to grow its share to 17% within the next three years as the entire market expands 150%. The bulls believe that Supermicro's booming AI server business, which already accounts for over half of its revenue, will offset its slower sales of traditional servers. That's why its stock has rallied alongside Nvidia's over the past two years.\n\nThe bear case against Supermicro\n\nSupermicro has grown like a weed over the past year, but a few cracks in the bull thesis appeared during its fourth-quarter earnings report on Aug. 6. Its 144% year-over-year revenue growth exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but its 78% adjusted earnings growth broadly missed the consensus forecast for 130% growth.\n\nMetric Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Revenue growth (YOY) 33% 15% 103% 201% 144% Gross margin 17% 16.7% 15.4% 15.5% 11.2% Adjusted EPS growth (YOY) 34% 0% 71% 308% 78%\n\nData source: Super Micro Computer. YOY = year over year.\n\nThe main culprit was the gross margin, which fell both sequentially and year over year as the company sold a less lucrative mix of mostly lower-margin products and ramped up spending on its newest direct liquid cooling (DLC) solutions. That contraction is troubling because it indicates Supermicro is selling its AI servers at considerably lower margins than its traditional servers.\n\nThat loss of pricing power was already weighing down Supermicro's stock when Hindenburg Research released a short-seller report on Aug. 27. Short-sellers make money when a stock on which they are \"short\" falls. The firm alleges Supermicro \"faces significant accounting, governance and compliance issues and offers an inferior product and service being eroded away by more credible competition.\" It points out that Supermicro's cloud deal with Amazon Web Services (AWS) ultimately failed and that its \"exclusive\" deal with Tesla actually ended when the EV maker struck a similar deal with Dell this May.\n\nHindenburg leveled other allegations and the following day Supermicro postponed its 10-K filing, saying it needed \"additional time\" to assess its \"internal controls over financial reporting.\" Its stock plummeted after that startling announcement, and it continued dropping after Nvidia posted its latest earnings report -- which featured strong but slowing sales of its data center chips.\n\nIs it time to buy or sell Supermicro's stock?\n\nSupermicro's stock trades at just 13 times forward earnings after its near-40% decline over the past month. That's a low valuation, but its shrinking gross margins, the troubling short-seller accusations, and its delayed 10-K filing raise some bright red flags. Its insiders also didn't buy a single share of the stock as it collapsed over the past three months.\n\nI thought Supermicro was an undervalued growth play after its postearnings plunge, but until Supermicro clears up the cloud around it with a clear 10-K filing, it's smarter to avoid or sell its stock and stick with more promising AI plays instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer On NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘Own It’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Jim Cramer’s 10 Stock Picks You Shouldn’t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other top stock picks.\n\nJim Cramer reacted to Monday’s market by questioning if there’s any money left to invest and why mutual funds aren’t holding enough cash. The S&P 500 fell 17.77 points, or 0.3%, to 5,616.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.44 points, or 0.2% to 41,240.52. The Nasdaq composite fell 152.03 points, or 0.9%, to 17,725.76.\n\n“What do we do if we’re out of money? Don’t mutual funds have enough cash? That’s my reaction to today’s market action. Right now, mutual funds know they have to pivot out of consistent growth stocks, especially tech stocks like software and semiconductors, which don’t benefit from rate cuts. They need to swap into companies that can supercharge their earnings as the Fed lowers rates. We all recognize that cyclical stocks, the ones that benefit from lower rates, can go higher, maybe much higher.”\n\nCramer pointed out that mutual funds now need to shift away from consistent growth stocks, particularly in tech sectors like software and semiconductors, which don’t benefit from interest rate cuts. Instead, they should move towards companies that can boost their earnings as the Federal Reserve reduces rates.\n\n“What’s painful for many of you are the declines in stocks of companies with consistent earnings. These companies, especially tech firms, don’t really need lower rates, and they’re selling off as money managers raise capital to rotate into the rate-cut winners.\n\nSo, why don’t we go over the winners and talk about the losers? The rate-cut winners are divided into two camps: stocks with high dividend yields and cyclical companies with earnings that should go higher because lower rates will bolster various industries, especially housing.”\n\nCramer explained that cyclical stocks, which tend to perform better with lower rates, are likely to rise, possibly significantly. However, the decline in stocks of companies with stable earnings, especially in tech, is troubling for many investors. These stocks are being sold off as money managers raise capital to invest in those poised to benefit from rate cuts.\n\nCramer emphasized that it’s important to understand who the winners and losers are in this situation. The winners include two groups: high-dividend-yield stocks and cyclical companies expected to see earnings growth from lower rates, particularly in the housing sector.\n\nCramer noted that housing stocks, which had seen significant gains, were down on Monday because hedge funds and mutual funds had bought heavily before the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole meeting. While mutual funds are holding on, hedge funds are cashing in their profits, as these stocks had sharp increases before the event. For traders, taking profits after such a successful trade is standard practice.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Let’s start with the most direct beneficiaries: housing. These stocks were all down today because hedge funds and mutual funds bought them aggressively ahead of Friday’s Jackson Hole verdict. Mutual funds are staying long, but hedge funds are ringing the register furiously because they’ve made so much money. Housing stocks had parabolic moves going into the Fed’s Jackson Hole conference, so now these portfolio managers are just taking profits. That’s what you’re supposed to do with a successful trade if you’re a trader.\n\nRemember, these guys are traders, not investors. So, the housing trade is over, but what about the housing investment? I believe Toll Brothers, which just reported a stellar quarter last week, can go higher, maybe much higher. But this reversal is going to constrain the stock because people do not like the technical trends we just saw. We’ve seen multiple long-term reversals after these kinds of moves, and they rarely turn out to be buyable, even though in theory, this should be a great moment for the stock of all the homebuilders.”\n\nCramer believes that while the housing trade may be over for traders, the housing investment story isn’t finished. He also warned that the recent reversal in housing stocks could limit their potential, as investors are wary of the technical trends.\n\n“It doesn’t matter, though. This kind of reversal I’m talking about can be hideous. Some of these stocks are very close to their highs, and I don’t like that.”\n\nCramer cautioned that these kinds of reversals can be severe and might discourage new buyers. He reminded everyone that by the time the Federal Reserve signals a clear path forward, it might be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. According to Cramer, it’s better to wait for these stocks to pull back and recharge before making a move.\n\n“Those who have them can hold on, but they flew too close to the sun to attract new buyers. Remember, I’ve said all along that by the time the Fed gives the all-clear, it may be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. You have to let them recharge, let them come down, and then you can pull the trigger.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer’s Mad Money and picked the ten notable stocks he mentioned. We also explore what hedge funds think about these stocks and rank them based on how many hedge funds own them, from the fewest to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers a compelling investment opportunity due to its leading role in the GPU market and its key position in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Jim Cramer shared a personal story about renaming his dog Everest after Nvidia in 2017 when the stock was just above $3. Over the next seven years, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock surged by more than 3,000%.\n\n“When I renamed my dog Everest after Nvidia back in 2017, at a time when the stock was $3 and change, who knew it would rally more than 3,000% over the next seven years? Many greeted my name change as a stunt, even as Everest, a rescue mutt who loved me dearly, beautifully answered to Nvidia whether I had a Blue Buffalo-filled steel cup or the more popular T-bone in my hand. That boy would eat anything, including Raisinets stolen from my backpack, which led to a midnight run to the vet…\n\nNo matter, my view is simple: Long-term, I believe in the use cases for Nvidia’s chips. I believe in the new industrial revolution as predicted by Jensen Huang, and that’s why I say, ‘Own it, don’t trade it.’ At the end of the day, I didn’t rename my pet after just any company.”\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs, such as the A100 and H100 Tensor Core models, are critical for advancements in AI, high-performance computing, and data centers. This leadership is evident in NVIDIA’s strong financial performance, with Q2 2024 revenue reaching $10.3 billion—a 25% increase from the previous year—driven by high demand in data centers and gaming.\n\nThe increasing need for cloud computing and data centers boosts NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s business, as its GPUs are essential for AI training and inference, and the company continues to secure large contracts with cloud providers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s investments in AI research, including platforms like CUDA and NVIDIA AI Enterprise, are yielding cutting-edge solutions used across various industries.\n\nAdditionally, the planned acquisition of ARM Holdings (pending regulatory approval) is expected to strengthen NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s technology portfolio and industry impact. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s gaming sector remains robust, supported by strong demand for its GeForce RTX graphics cards and ongoing advancements in gaming technology.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among Goldman Sachs’ Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\n\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\n\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\n\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\n\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\n\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\n\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities’ PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\n\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\n\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 179\n\nGS' Number Of Funds: 41\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading GPU designer. It provides the chips for enterprise computing (including AI), consumer gaming, assisted driving, and other use cases. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s GPU performance boosted by its design strengths has pushed it right to the top of the AI hardware supply chain. The firm's GPUs are the most highly sought products in the market, and they provide NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with significant pricing power. At the same time, all eyes remain on the firm for consistent upgrades, and it might struggle if it fails to launch new products. This has been evident in 2024, with multiple reports having claimed that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s leading edge Blackwell chips are facing delays. Its CUDA software is another advantage since it enables users to fully control their GPUs. However, high GPU prices could incentivize NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s big ticket customers to design their own products and reduce the demand for its chips. Furthermore, if Wall Street decides that AI monetization is not worth the billions of dollars being spent, then the stock could see headwinds.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"More recently, however, we’ve entered the period of doubts and questioning, some of which is real and normal in the first stages of a new paradigm, and some of which is prompted by short sellers. Given the explosive returns of NVIDIA and other AI leaders, AI bears and fear mongers have been comparing the current AI market winners with the internet bubble of the late 1990s/early 2000s, and NVIDIA’s stock move today with Cisco’s back then. First, while many stocks were trading at nosebleed valuations and on made up metrics (such as price per eyeballs) before the bursting of the internet bubble, as we’ve said many times, the internet proved to transform our world and create the digital age we are now living in. Second, while NVIDIA’s stock price inflection has been nothing short of unprecedented for a company of its size, it was fueled almost entirely by explosive growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flows– not multiple expansion. Over the last 12 months, NVIDIA’s stock has eectively tripled, but its forward P/E multiple has remained essentially flat, because NVIDIA blew away Wall Street expectations despite being covered by over 60 sell-side analysts, who have increased their forward projections every single quarter. In my career, the only comparative analogue is when Apple first introduced the iPhone and stunned Wall Street with its growth. In contrast, most of Cisco’s move in the late 1990s was due to multiple expansion. At its peak, Cisco traded at a P/E ratio over 130 times, more than quadruple its five-year average of 37 times. At the end of the second quarter, NVIDIA traded at a P/E ratio of 40 times, equal to its five-year average, and at a P/E to growth (or PEG) ratio for 2025 of 0.8 times, as consensus expectations are for NVIDIA to grow earnings per share 40% next year.\n\nMoreover, investor concerns have arisen about the financial impact AI is having and whether surging capital expenditures (capex) across the technology landscape, particularly the large cloud players (Microso, Google, Amazon, and Meta), known as the hyperscalers, will be justified and earn reasonable returns on invested capital (ROIC). First, the adoption and penetration of new technology typically traces a classic S-curve–or more precisely, in our view, a series of S-curves or phases. For at least the past year and a half, we’ve been in what might be called the AI infrastructure- build phase – building the AI factories, as NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has articulated it, and this phase has been dominated by the infrastructure- layer players – the accelerated computing chips suppliers like NVIDIA and Broadcom, as well as data center, cloud infrastructure and energy companies. The hyperscalers, other enterprises, and sovereign entities investing ahead understand that if you want to be in the AI game, you must invest now – build the infrastructure, build the factories – or else you’ll find yourselves disrupted on the sidelines or playing catch up in the biggest game, the most important race in a technology generation. Only those who invest today even have the chance to be the winners of the future.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Top tech bull compares Nvidia to LeBron James in high school as AI boom accelerates",
        "content": "Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has a reputation for colorful quotes on tech stocks, and AI chip giant Nvidia has often been the target of his rhetorical arsenal.\n\nOn Thursday, he continued to make the bull case for Nvidia, comparing it to one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n\n\"If you look at Nvidia here, this is LeBron in high school in terms of where this story is ultimately going,\" Ives told Bloomberg TV.\n\nLater in the interview, he circled back to the comparison and said the reason why Nvidia resembles a young LeBron James is because it's so far ahead of any other competitor and is \"the only game in town.\"\n\nThe remarks came as investors were sending Nvidia stock lower despite an earnings report that blew away forecasts late Wednesday.\n\nBut while Wall Street's concerns were focused on delays to the forthcoming Blackwell chips, Ives said CEO Jensen Huang put to rest those worries with revenue guidance that was still robust, even if it fell short of the most aggressive analyst views.\n\n\"They came. They delivered,\" he added about Nvidia earnings. \"And I think for tech, this is going to put fuel in that rally.\"\n\nBased on his channel checks in Asia, Ives estimated that Blackwell revenue could reach tens of billions dollars, attributing the company's vaguer guidance to Huang being reluctant to reveal his playbook.\n\nHe also touted a multiplier effect Nvidia has across the broader tech landscape, saying every dollar spent on its chips ripples through the sector by a factor of 8-10 times.\n\nThat's as Ives sees $1 trillion of capital expenditures on AI over the next three years—double his forecast from just six months ago.\n\nDemand for Nvidia chips is also accelerating and widening beyond the so-called hyperscaler customers like Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google, with other enterprises stepping up as more AI use cases emerge, he added.\n\n\"Rome wasn't built in a day, neither will the AI revolution,\" he predicted. \"It's starting to come together.\"\n\nIves wasn't the only Wall Street analyst looking past the initial stock market reaction to Nvidia's earnings report. Most still put shares in the \"buy\" category.\n\nBank of America Global Research reiterated a buy rating and raised its price target on shares from $150 to $165, saying Nvidia remains the “key genAI cycle beneficiary” and imploring investors to “ignore quarterly noise.”\n\nNvidia stock closed Friday at $119.37, representing a weekly loss of about 8%.\n\n“We think the AI rally has further to run, despite investors’ apparent disappointment with Nvidia’s rapid profit growth,” Thomas Matthews, Capital Economics’ head of markets, Asia Pacific, said in a note.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\n\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\n\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reveal that the company is planning to invest in a funding round for OpenAI, the firm that launched ChatGPT back in late 2022 to kickstart the AI revolution. Other tech big hitters like Apple and Microsoft will likely also participate in this funding round. OpenAI would reach a valuation of $100 billion if the funding goals for this round are achieved. The reports come within hours of NVIDIA topping analyst expectations on earnings and guidance for the second quarter of this fiscal year.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, in an appearance on news platform CNBC after the earnings call, said that the company expected to earn billions of dollars in revenue from volume production of Blackwell chips in the fourth quarter and ramp up from there. Huang also underlined that hyperscalers only represented 45% of the total data center revenue of his company, emphasizing that NVIDIA was well diversified in this area, with customers ranging from internet service providers, sovereign AI firms, to industries and enterprises.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Going to Make Big Moves in 2025. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Artificial technology (AI) is here to stay. Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT are already disrupting many industries with AI-generated text, images, and even videos. The next generation of LLMs will be even more powerful, and I probably haven't even imagined the incoming wave of killer apps yet.\n\nBut nobody knows who will make the next big AI move. The big winners in this stock market boom are largely generalists -- makers of the computer chips and systems that power today's AI software. And even the most dazzling market darlings have met some investor skepticism lately. AI chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are down 16% from their recent highs, and server systems builder Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) took a 63% swan dive in about five months. They could recover and skyrocket again, or maybe they're still facing further price cuts.\n\nSo how do you invest in the exciting AI space without running into a potentially overvalued land mine? In my view, the trick is to start with a fairly priced or even undervalued AI stock. Step two: Make sure it's a high-quality company with potential to disrupt its chosen industry in the long run. It's a short checklist, but it also produces a short list of results.\n\nToday, I would recommend approaching the AI space from a very different angle. Have you looked into Fiverr International(NYSE: FVRR) lately? This stock looks ready to make a big splash in 2025.\n\nFiverr's business model and revenue streams\n\nFiverr runs an online marketplace for freelance services. The company makes it easy for freelancers to advertise their services, and for service buyers to get the help they need. In return, Fiverr pockets a small fee for every service-buying transaction. Popular activities include coding, writing, graphic design, and film editing.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that, but there's your snapshot of Fiverr's core business plan.\n\nThe company has been around since 2010, but it's still a small fish in a big pond. The overarching goal is to change how people do business, and that's a pretty ambitious goal. Management estimates that the domestic market for the types of services you find on Fiverr was worth $247 billion in 2021. But most of those freelance services are sought and found offline, mostly through old-school methods such as personal acquaintances, newspaper ads, or social media posts.\n\nThe opportunity to take friction out of that connection process is enormous and Fiverr is just getting started. The company only collected $298 million in 2021 revenue, or about 1.2% of the freelance services market. Top-line revenue has increased by 26% since then, standing at an annual run rate of $376 million today. At the same time, the target market keeps growing, too; Fiverr's growth potential is still enormous.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill generative AI help or hurt Fiverr?\n\nSo far, Fiverr may not sound like much of an AI stock. In fact, many investors have sworn off buying Fiverr stock because they see generative AI tools such as ChatGPT's text creation and Midjourney's digital images as a direct threat to this company. Who needs a freelancer when you can get the help you need from a low-cost generative AI tool, right?\n\nAs it turns out, however, those generative AI tools aren't very helpful without some human guidance. Coming up with the right inputs to generate usable AI-powered content is a bankable skill, and so is the sifting and editing of generated outputs. And Fiverr is happy to connect you with a freelance who can help.\n\nTherefore, generative AI might look like a threat, but Fiverr actually sees it as another potential service-selling channel.\n\n\"We are in the early innings of unleashing the full potential of AI in our marketplace, and we believe it will be a multiyear tailwind for us to drive product innovation and growth,\" Fiverr CEO Micha Kaufman said in July's second-quarter earnings call with analysts.\n\nFiverr's potential\n\nFiverr's stock soared in 2020 as millions of people found themselves stuck at home with lots of time to spare to sell their services digitally. Share prices started to fall as soon as effective COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, and the skeptics haven't looked back. At this point, Fiverr's stock trades 92% below the peak prices of early 2021.\n\nHowever, the business never stopped making sense. I already mentioned Fiverr's rising revenue, and the growth story continues further down the financial statements. Free cash flows have more than tripled in two years and trailing bottom-line earnings recently turned positive.\n\nThe stock probably deserved a price correction in 2021, but the bearish market makers took it too far. Fiverr is a successful and profitable business, seeking to disrupt an enormous target market. Yet its stock trades at just 11 times free cash flow, 2.6 times trailing sales, and 9.1 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nSo if you're looking for a strong AI stock in Wall Street's bargain bins, I highly recommend taking a closer look at Fiverr. This stock is poised to soar as top-line sales grow and bottom-line profits skyrocket. The bullish business trend is already underway, and I'm just waiting for bearish investors to notice. I predict the stock is going to make big moves next year and I'll be along for the ride.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fiverr International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fiverr International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Fiverr International wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Institutional investors may overlook NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent US$251b market cap drop as long-term gains remain positive",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in NVIDIA implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Recent sales by insiders\n\nEvery investor in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nNo shareholder likes losing money on their investments, especially institutional investors who saw their holdings drop 7.7% in value last week. Still, the 146% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NVIDIA?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NVIDIA. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NVIDIA's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.7% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.5% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is the owner of 3.5% of the company's shares.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of NVIDIA\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in NVIDIA Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$113b. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 30% stake in NVIDIA. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for NVIDIA  (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Forget AMD: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has a potent role in tech, supplying its chips to companies across the industry. Its hardware powers everything, from video game consoles to cloud platforms, consumer-built personal computers, laptops, and AI models. As a result, AMD formed lucrative partnerships with companies like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Sony, and Meta Platforms.\n\nAMD's success over the years saw its revenue and operating income increase by 224% and 45%, relatively, since 2019. Meanwhile, its stock climbed by 384% in the last five years. The company boasts a long growth history and has a solid outlook as it expands into high-growth sectors like AI.\n\nHowever, a rally over the last year and a business that has only recently begun seeing returns on its significant investment in AI means its stock isn't exactly a bargain. AMD PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhen you consider the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of some of the most prominent names in AI, including three chipmakers and two leading cloud providers, AMD has the highest P/E among these companies, indicating its stock offers the least value.\n\nAMD's P/E might prove inconsequential over the long term, as the company's stock will likely continue rising as the tech industry expands. However, for anyone looking for bargains, it might be best to avoid AMD for now.\n\nSo, forget AMD this month and consider buying these two tech stocks instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't a screaming value with a P/E of 74. However, its stock remains a compelling option with a lower P/E than its rivals, AMD and Intel, and a majority market share in AI.\n\nChip stocks are one of the best ways to invest in tech, with their hardware crucial to the industry's development. Advances in chip technology bolstered countless markets over the last decade, encouraging innovation in cloud computing, virtual/augmented reality, data centers, consumer tech, gaming, and more. As a result, chip demand has skyrocketed in recent years. NVDA Chart\n\nAs leading chipmakers, Nvidia and AMD  enjoyed solid gains over the last half-decade thanks to increased chip sales. While both companies have delivered stellar growth, it's hard to ignore how much higher Nvidia's earnings and share price have risen compared to AMD's. Nvidia's has also proven to be more reliable, with its earnings and stock steadily trending up, while AMD experienced more volatility.\n\nNvidia's success is mainly due to its dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are high-performance chips capable of completing multiple tasks simultaneously. GPUs are critical for training AI models and powering data centers. Consequently, the AI chip market is projected to hit $71 billion this year, with Nvidia's hardware accounting for an estimated 90% of the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has a solid role in tech, and its business will likely continue expanding as demand for its chips rises. This year, the company reached $39 billion in free cash flow, significantly outperforming AMD's just over $1 billion. Nvidia has the financial resources to continue investing in AI and maintain its lead. Meanwhile, its better-valued stock makes it a no-brainer right now.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhen investing in tech, it's a good idea to diversify your holdings in software and hardware. While Nvidia is an excellent option for securing a position in the hardware side of the industry, Microsoft has years of experience dominating software. Home-grown products like Windows, Office, Xbox, Azure, and LinkedIn have helped the company build a massive user base and a powerful role in tech. MSFT Chart\n\nSince 2019, Microsoft delivered less earnings and share price growth than AMD. However, like Nvidia, Microsoft has been far more consistent, making it a less risky investment. As a result, the company's stock is potentially a better long-term hold.\n\nMicrosoft's reliability is mainly due to its thoroughly diverse business model. The company has leading positions in multiple tech areas, from productivity software to operating systems, video games, social media, cloud computing, and digital advertising.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft is never still for long, consistently reinvesting in its business and seeking out new growth markets. The company's commitment to innovation saw it become an early investor in AI, sinking $1 billion into ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. That figure has since risen to about $13 billion, with the powerful partnership giving Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI software.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has already begun seeing earnings boosts from AI, thanks to recently launched AI solutions on its cloud platform, Azure, and paid-for features in Office. In fiscal 2024 (ending in June), Microsoft's revenue increased by 16% year over year, while operating income soared 24%. The period benefited from a 20% rise in cloud sales and a 12% increase in its productivity and business processes segment, with both divisions expanding their AI offerings.\n\nMicrosoft's diverse business provides it with countless ways to monetize its AI venture.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Bitcoin's Next Big Move",
        "content": "Even after a steep plunge earlier in August, Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) is still up almost 40% for the year. That's the good news. The bad news is that Bitcoin recently dipped below $60,000 again, and shows few, if any, signs of rebounding anytime soon. During the past 30 days, Bitcoin is down 11%. In fact, August is shaping up to be Bitcoin's worst month since April.\n\nBut I think many of the fears of the Bitcoin bears may be overstated. In fact, I'm predicting that the next big move for Bitcoin will be a rebound to $100,000 by year-end.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin falling?\n\nAs a first step, it's important to figure out why Bitcoin has been falling. The best explanation, from my perspective, is that inflows into the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are slowing, and that's putting a brake on any upward Bitcoin price action. Since the launch of the new spot ETFs in January, the steady inflow of new money into Bitcoin is what has pushed up prices. So if these inflows dry up, then it makes sense that Bitcoin is going to trade sideways or down.\n\nMoreover, investors were obviously spooked by the August flash crash, when the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies collapsed literally overnight. So, from a sentiment perspective, it makes sense that investors are becoming much more cautious about which risk assets they are willing to put their money into. The new narrative is that investors are rushing to pull their money out of Bitcoin so that they can put it into Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThus, for Bitcoin to begin its ascent to $100,000, investor sentiment needs to improve and inflows into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs need to return to their former pace. And this appears to be what is happening. During the final days of August, the spot Bitcoin ETFs posted eight straight days of positive inflows.\n\nKey catalysts ahead\n\nThere are two key catalysts that could help to boost ETF inflows and restore investor confidence in Bitcoin. The first is the Bitcoin halving, which took place back in April, cutting the rate of new coin creation. At the time, it was heralded as the most important crypto event of the year, and was supposed to result in Bitcoin skyrocketing in price. Until now, though, the halving has been a nothing-burger, and many investors may have forgotten about it entirely.\n\nBut there is growing reason to expect that the real impact of the halving will begin to be felt as we head into the final months of the year. For example, historical evidence suggests that it takes at least 200 days after the date of the halving for Bitcoin to kick into a higher gear. And guess what: 200 days from the time of the Bitcoin halving on April 19 brings us to the end of October as the potential start date of a new Bitcoin bull market cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is the same pattern that occurred during the previous Bitcoin halving cycle in 2020. As can be seen from the chart below, Bitcoin meandered along during the summer and early fall after its halving event in May, before kicking into a new higher gear in the final months of the year. There's no guarantee this same pattern will occur again, of course, but my fingers are crossed. Bitcoin / U.S. dollar chart by TradingView\n\nThe second key catalyst is the U.S. presidential election. Pro-crypto sentiment appears to be building on both sides of the political aisle and Bitcoin has actually emerged as a campaign issue. The greatest impact would be felt if the Republicans win the White House, because Donald Trump is the first presidential candidate ever with a pro-Bitcoin agenda.\n\nBut there is reason to think that the Democrats, too, could be persuaded to pass sweeping pro-crypto legislation that makes it much more enticing to invest in Bitcoin. Either way, Bitcoin could benefit from a so-called relief rally as investors pile back into crypto in November.\n\nHow likely is $100,000?\n\nAdmittedly, for Bitcoin to almost double in price and hit $100,000 by the end of the year, a lot of things will need to go right. But if ETF inflows revive, and if crypto sentiment once again turns bullish, it might just happen. Keep in mind, too, that there could be a number of positive surprise events -- such as China reversing its ban on crypto -- that could unlock a tremendous amount of upside potential for Bitcoin.\n\nThroughout Bitcoin's 15-year history, a strategy of buying the dip has usually paid off for investors. And I don't think this time will be any different. This might be the last time to buy Bitcoin at such a discounted price. By the end of the year, six-figure Bitcoin could be the new normal.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's $50 Billion Share Buyback Is an Epically Bad Decision That Sends the Wrong Message to Wall Street and Investors",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, investors have patiently waited for the next big innovation to come along that could meaningfully alter the growth trajectory for corporate America. The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) may be the answer.\n\nLast year, analysts at PwC released a report (\"Sizing the Prize\") that estimated the combined consumption-side benefits and productivity gains from AI would add $15.7 trillion to the worldwide economy by 2030. If this forecast is anywhere close to reality, it suggests that a multitude of companies could become big-time winners from the AI revolution.\n\nThus far, no company has been a bigger beneficiary of the rise of AI than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- but this doesn't mean Wall Street's AI darling has made all the right moves. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia quickly became the enterprise data center AI hardware kingpin\n\nPretty much since the green flag waved, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the preferred choice in AI-accelerated data centers. Based on estimates from semiconductor analyst firm TechInsights, 2.67 million GPUs and 3.85 million GPUs were shipped for use in enterprise data centers in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Nvidia accounted for all but 30,000 (in 2022) and 90,000 (in 2023) of these GPU shipments.\n\nControlling around 98% of the market for the GPUs being used to oversee generative AI solutions and train large language models (LLMs) has afforded Nvidia phenomenal pricing power on its game-changing chips. Whereas Advanced Micro Devices is selling its MI300X AI-GPU for between $10,000 and $15,000, Nvidia's H100 GPU briefly topped $40,000 earlier this year. Overwhelming demand, coupled with clear-cut GPU scarcity, has led to a melt-up in Nvidia's adjusted gross margin.\n\nThe company's CUDA software platform has played a key role in keeping businesses loyal to its products and services, too. CUDA is the toolkit that developers use to build LLMs and maximize the potential of their Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia's fiscal second-quarter operating results, which detail its activity from April 29 through July 28, demonstrate just how robust demand has been for its ecosystem of solutions. Net sales grew by a scorching-hot 122% to top $30 billion for the quarter, while net income of $16.6 billion (up 168% year-over-year) once again blew past analyst expectations.\n\nBut not every decision being made by Nvidia's management team has, arguably, been the right one.\n\nNvidia's $50 billion share repurchase authorization sends the wrong message to shareholders\n\nLet me preface this discussion by not hiding that I've been a harsh critic of Nvidia's valuation and its historic ascent from a $360 billion market cap to a $3 trillion goliath. While recognizing that AI has mass long-term appeal, I stand by my thesis that artificial intelligence is a technology that needs time to mature. I also firmly believe competitive pressures will steadily chip away at the otherworldly GPU pricing power Nvidia has enjoyed.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut my criticism of Nvidia as an investment and company has an entirely new focus today: the $50 billion share repurchase program authorized by its board, as noted in the company's second-quarter report. This $50 billion comes atop the $7.5 billion remaining from its prior share buyback program.\n\nMost companies authorize share buybacks for two reasons. Firstly, businesses with steady or growing net income that repurchase their stock will often see a lift to earnings per share (EPS). In other words, net income is being divided into a smaller outstanding share count, resulting in higher EPS, which can make a company's stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nThe other reason a company's board authorizes share repurchases is to demonstrate to investors that it feels its stock is a bargain.\n\nWhile Nvidia's $50 billion share repurchase authorization is likely aimed at increasing EPS and instilling confidence in its stock, it sends entirely the wrong message to Wall Street and shareholders for three reasons. NVDA Shares Sold By Insiders Chart\n\n1. Nvidia's insiders are selling at a torrid pace\n\nThe first glaring flaw with this plan is that insider selling activity has never been more pronounced. Between mid-June and mid-August, CEO Jensen Huang disposed of 4.8 million shares of his company's stock over 20 trading sessions, totaling nearly $580 million.\n\nMoreover, the last time an Nvidia insider purchased a single share of their company's stock on the open market was December 2020.\n\nThe company's board just authorized a mammoth buyback during a period of unprecedented insider selling activity, which has totaled north of $1.6 billion over the trailing-12-month period. What sort of message does this send when insiders won't buy a single share on the open market, but the board wants you to believe the company's shares are still a good value?\n\n2. The company only has $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n\nAnother reason this $50 billion share repurchase authorization is an epically bad decision by Nvidia is because it ended the fiscal second quarter with \"only\" $34.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in its treasure chest.\n\nTo be fair, Nvidia has been a positive cash flow machine in recent quarters, and the company's share buyback program has no end date. Nevertheless, $50 billion is more of a pie-in-the-sky target than something that's actually achievable anytime soon.\n\nI'll also add to this point that $50 billion in share buybacks at Nvidia's closing price on Aug. 29 would only reduce its outstanding share count by (drum roll) 1.62%! That's a lot money to have virtually no impact on EPS. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Nvidia can't find a better use for $50 billion while on the leading edge of the hottest innovation?\n\nLastly, it's almost incomprehensible that Nvidia is targeting up to $50 billion in additional share repurchases when it's leading the charge (for now) in data-center AI hardware.\n\nIn order to maintain is computing advantage(s) in AI-accelerated data centers, Nvidia will need to aggressively invest in research and development. Although the launch of its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture is nearing, and CEO Jensen Huang recently teased the Rubin platform, which will be released in 2026, you'd think a game-changer like Nvidia could find a better use for $50 billion on the innovative front than just buying back its stock to, perhaps, increase its quarterly EPS by a few pennies.\n\nWith capacity constraints at chip fabricators slowing down Nvidia's expansion -- Nvidia is fabless and outsources its chip production -- I'd think a far better use for $50 billion would be to find ways to reduce or eliminate these supply chain restrictions. Acquiring additional capacity or building manufacturing facilities to resolve these issues would make far more sense than a $50 billion buyback program that effectively signals that the board and management team have no better ideas.\n\nIt's looking increasingly likely that Nvidia's best days are in the rearview mirror.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia’s incredible rise has been powered by 3 crucial but overlooked factors",
        "content": "In the fevered run-up to the most over-hyped quarterly earnings announcement in recent years—Nvidia’s, of course—it’s hard to believe that anything of relevance was left unsaid. But in fact three crucial elements of the Nvidia story were under-played or ignored. Without understanding them, envisioning the company’s future is hopeless.\n\nBelieve it or not, Nvidia’s profitability is more astonishing than you think\n\nThe company’s profit for the second quarter was a staggering 168% greater than profit for the same quarter last year. If Nividia just earned that same profit for the year’s two remaining quarters, it would be the fourth most profitable company in the Fortune 500 (behind only Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, and Microsoft). But Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia’s profits to continue growing strongly this year—and on average the analysts have underestimated Nvidia’s performance so far.\n\nEven more impressive is Nvidia’s profitability on multiple measures. I have long preferred measures based on economic profit, also known as economic value added (EVA), which eliminates distortions in standard accounting. Institutional Shareholder Services calculates EVA data for 21,000 publicly traded companies worldwide, and it reports that Nvidia’s returns on capital and its upward trend put it in the 100th percentile for profitability. That doesn’t mean Nvidia is in the top percentile (which would be the 99th percentile). It means Nvidia ranks above all those other 21,000 companies, or possibly ties with some of them.\n\nThat is simply phenomenal. When Nvidia’s profit growth slows down, as eventually it must, the company could still rank in the 95th percentile—or heck, even in that shabby 85th percentile—and remain an extraordinary financial performer.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang’s early life was tougher than you probably know, and it helps explain his successful leadership\n\nHuang made news in March when he spoke to students at his alma mater, Stanford University. “Greatness is not intelligence,” he told them. “Greatness comes from character, and character isn’t formed out of smart people. It’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nHe didn’t go into much personal detail at that event, though he has often mentioned that he was a dishwasher at Denny’s, “and then they promoted me to busboy.” But he was much more open about his formative years when he spoke to Fortune 23 years ago:\n\nIn 1973, the 9-year-old Huang was living in Thailand with his Chinese parents. Worried about the political situation there, his parents decided to send him to a U.S. boarding school his uncle had found in a magazine ad. Before long Huang was enrolled in the Oneida Baptist Institute in Oneida, Ky. … It turned out the institute was a school for troubled kids. Huang's 17-year-old roommate was fresh out of prison and covered with stab wounds. Huang says that during his two years at the school he got beat up a lot and spent afternoons cleaning the latrine. Nonetheless, he looks on those days as a valuable experience. \"Now I don't get scared often. I don't worry about going places I haven't gone before,\" says Huang, \"and I can tolerate a lot of discomfort.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuffering remains central to Huang’s leadership. “To this day I use the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ inside our company with great glee,” he told Stanford students. “You want to refine the character of your company. You want greatness out of them.”\n\nHuang will wait years for his convictions to pay off\n\nCEOs often complain that Wall Street won’t let them embark on long-term projects that will yield profits only far in the future. Huang has insisted on pursuing such projects anyway. Investors should know that Nvidia’s history is a story of spending years to create technology for which there is no market until the technology creates a market.\n\nNvidia’s first project was designing chips to create 3D graphics for videogames when videogames barely existed. Eventually the chips turbocharged the games industry and made Nvidia successful. Huang and his partners knew that same technology could do much more, including powering a new way of computing that became AI. But “for 10, 15 years, the markets that fuel Nvidia today just didn’t exist,” says Huang. “All your shareholders, your board of directors, your partners—you’re taking everybody with you, and there’s no evidence of a market. That is really, really challenging.”\n\nHuang’s experience is a warning to Nvidia investors that some day after today’s AI frenzy, the time may come when they must be patient. It’s also an inspiration to business leaders that pain and suffering will yield dividends, and that persistence and confidence can pay off, sometimes spectacularly.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Stock That Has Skyrocketed More Than Nvidia Since the Start of 2023: Is It Too Late to Buy?",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) have surged 785% higher. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted this business to new heights, and investors couldn't be more excited about its prospects.\n\nHowever, one e-commerce stock has skyrocketed more than the AI infrastructure enterprise. Shares of the booming online car retailer Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) are up 3,270% since the beginning of 2023, which would've turned $1,000 into almost $34,000 today.\n\nYou might be thinking that it's time to ride the momentum to huge returns. But is it too late to buy Carvana stock?\n\nImproving fundamentals\n\nTo say that Carvana was a struggling enterprise might be putting it lightly. In fact, the company was quite literally on the verge of bankruptcy, which was spurred by Carvana's acquisition of the ADESA auction platform. The leadership team restructured its debt a year ago, lowering interest payments and extending maturities.\n\nCleaning up the balance sheet, or management's actions that at least gave the company some breathing room, worked wonders to boost investor sentiment toward the stock. Near-term uncertainty was drastically reduced.\n\nCarvana also deserves credit for improving its fundamentals. In 2022, the business reported a 3% volume decline, and the net loss ballooned to $2.9 billion. Revenue and unit volume tanked in 2023, but a relentless focus on cost cuts drastically improved the income statement.\n\nAlthough they're tiny figures, Carvana has posted positive earnings in each of the first two quarters of 2024. The company is also growing again. The stock's monster performance shows that when the market has extremely low expectations, even the smallest fundamental improvements can have a beneficial impact. But Carvana isn't out of the woods just yet.\n\nBig picture\n\nIf we simply ignore the company's financial picture (Carvana still carries $5.6 billion in long-term debt), it's clear that Carvana is solving a big problem in the industry. Consumers generally aren't happy with the traditional car-buying process. Shoppers must haggle with a salesperson, deal with lots of paperwork, and choose from a limited inventory. Plus, it doesn't help that the entire process can take hours.\n\nHere's where Carvana truly shines. Consumers can buy a car and obtain financing in a matter of minutes. And there's a huge nationwide pool of cars to choose from. What's more, Carvana offers free delivery on select cars, and there's also a seven-day trial period. It's no wonder the business sold 131% more units in the latest quarter than it did five years before in Q2 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's easy to be optimistic about long-term growth prospects, too. Last year, about 36 million used cars were sold in the U.S., which gives Carvana less than 1% market share based on 2023 figures. This is an extremely fragmented industry that an online-only platform could penetrate and command a bigger portion of.\n\nBut there's competition. There are traditional dealerships, many of which are starting to bolster their digital offerings, and Carvana must also contend with scaled car retailers like AutoNation and CarMax.\n\nMoreover, Carvana's ultimate success is far from certain. A lot can go wrong, like the business running into financial troubles again or the economy entering a severe recession. In the latest quarter, 67% of operating income went toward paying interest expenses, which doesn't leave much wiggle room.\n\nPessimism to optimism\n\nAt their low point in December 2022, shares traded at a dirt cheap price-to-sales ratio of 0.025. That multiple has soared to 2.6 today. The valuation is no longer compelling, in my opinion. That argument holds more weight when you realize that Carvana remains a risky business to own.\n\nInvestors should think twice before buying the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Carvana right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Carvana, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carvana wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "U.S. stock rally broadens as investors await Fed",
        "content": "By David Randall\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A broadening rally in U.S. stocks is offering an encouraging signal to investors worried about concentration in technology shares, as markets await key jobs data and the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts in September.\n\nAs the market's fortunes keep rising and falling with big tech stocks such as Nvidia and Apple, investors are also putting money in less-loved value stocks and small caps, which are expected to benefit from lower interest rates. The Fed is expected to kick off a rate-cutting cycle at its monetary policy meeting on Sept. 17-18.\n\nMany investors view the broadening trend, which picked up steam last month before faltering during an early August sell-off, as a healthy development in a market rally led by a cluster of giant tech names. Chipmaker Nvidia, which has benefited from bets on artificial intelligence, alone has accounted for roughly a quarter of the S&P 500's year-to-date gain of 18.4%.\n\n\"No matter how you slice and dice it you have seen a pretty meaningful broadening out and I think that has legs,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab.\n\nValue stocks are those of companies trading at a discount on metrics like book value or price-to-earnings and include sectors such as financials and industrials. Some investors believe rallies in these sectors and small caps could go further if the Fed cuts borrowing costs while the economy stays healthy.\n\nThe market's rotation has recently accelerated, with 61% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperforming the index in the past month, compared to 14% outperforming over the past year, Charles Schwab data showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called Magnificent Seven group of tech giants - which includes Nvidia, Tesla and Microsoft - have underperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 14 percentage points since the release of a weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation report on July 11, according to an analysis by BofA Global Research.\n\nStocks have also held up after an Nvidia forecast failed to meet lofty investor expectations earlier this week, another sign that investors may be looking beyond tech. The equal weight S&P 500 index, a proxy for the average stock, hit a fresh record this week and is up around 10.5% year-to-date, narrowing its performance gap with the S&P 500.\n\n\"When market breadth is improving, the message is that an increasing number of stocks are rallying on expectations that economic conditions will support earnings growth and profitability,\" analysts at Ned David Research wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nValue stocks that have performed well this year include General Electric and midstream energy company Targa Resources, which are up 70% and 68%, respectively. The small-cap focused Russell 2000 index, meanwhile, is up 8.5% from its lows of the month, though it has not breached its July peak.\n\nNext Friday's non-farm payrolls report could help bolster the case for a broader market rally if it shows the labor market is cooling at a steady, though not alarming pace, said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. Equities for UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nThe jobs report \"tends to be one of the more market moving releases in general, and right now it's going to get even more attention than normal.\"\n\nInvestors are unlikely to turn their back on tech stocks, particularly if volatility gives them a chance to buy on the cheap, said Jason Alonzo, a portfolio manager with Harbor Capital.\n\nTechnology stocks are expected to post above-market earnings growth over every quarter through 2025, with third-quarter earnings coming in at 15.3% compared with a 7.5% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to LSEG data.\n\n\"People will sometimes take a deep breath after a nice run and look at other opportunities, but technology is still the clearest driver of growth, particularly the AI theme which is innocent until proven guilty,\" Alonzo said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Looking Ahead to the Q3 Earnings Season",
        "content": "Total Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. This would follow the +8.6% earnings growth for the index in the preceding period on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nRegular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our sanguine view on corporate profitability: the earnings picture isn’t great, but it isn’t bad either.\n\nOur takeaway from the Q2 earnings season has been that the overall earnings picture was stable, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. We have been flagging, however, the emergence of question marks over the earnings outlook, as the revisions trend appears to have reversed the positive and favorable move that we had been highlighting for the preceding two to three quarters.\n\nThis negative revisions trend is particularly notable regarding expectations for 2024 Q3, with earnings estimates for the period getting revised down much more than we had seen in other recent periods. You can see this in the chart below that tracks the evolution of Q3 earnings growth expectations over the last couple of months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNot only is the magnitude of cuts to Q3 estimates bigger than what we saw in the comparable periods for the last three quarters, but it is also widespread and not concentrated in one or a few sectors. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, estimates have been revised down for 14 sectors, with the Transportation, Energy, Business Services, and Aerospace sectors suffering the biggest declines. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones whose estimates have modestly risen since the period began.\n\nThe chart below shows the Q3 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of what we saw in actual results over the preceding four quarters and what is expected over the following three quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned negative revisions trend, the expectation is for an accelerating growth trend over the coming periods.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with the +8% earnings growth this year followed by double-digit gains in 2025 and 2026. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8% earnings growth improves to +9.6% on an ex-Energy basis.\n\nRecapping the Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nPlease note that the Q2 earnings season isn’t officially over yet, as we still have 6 S&P 500 members that have yet to report quarterly results as of Friday, August 30th. Five of these remaining six index members are on deck to report results this week, including Dollar Tree, Hormel Foods, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Copart, and Broadcom.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the 494 S&P 500 members that have reported Q2 results already through Friday, August 30th, total earnings are up +8.6% from the same period last year on +3.6% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and only 60.1% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we have been pointing out, the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage has been an enduring feature of this reporting cycle. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 60.1% was a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe earnings focus lately has been on the Magnificent 7 member and semiconductor leader Nvidia NVDA, which came out with another beat-and-raise quarterly report on August 28th. Nvidia’s Q2 earnings increased +157.4% from the same period last year on +122.4% higher revenues.\n\nThe market wasn’t impressed with Nvidia’s blockbuster results, as the company’s guidance came up short of the whispered range. While the analyst community is broadly laudatory in their commentary on the release, the stock has lost some ground. However, the lack of market follow-through for Nvidia shares could very well be a reflection of the stock’s impressive year-to-date gains rather than a comment on its outlook.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Q2 Earnings Reflect Positivity, But Q3 Estimates Decrease\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD or INTC?",
        "content": "Wall Street darling NVIDIA Corporation NVDA recently reported its fiscal second-quarter results, following which its shares dipped. Does this mean that NVIDIA has lost its sheen to arch-rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC in the semiconductor space? Or, does it still have the potential to increase shareholders’ wealth soon? Let’s examine –\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Earnings Top, Shares Drop\n\nNVIDIA recently posted blowout second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues and net income that easily surpassed analysts’ estimates. For the quarter ending on July 28, 2024, earnings per share for the chipmaker came in at $0.68, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 152% year over year.\n\nTotal reported revenues were $30 billion, up 15% from the previous quarter and 122% from a year ago. Revenues of each segment, such as data center, gaming, professional visualization, and robotics were up from the previous quarter and year.\n\nStrong demand for existing Hopper chips and shipping of next-generation Blackwell artificial intelligence (AI) chips to be launched later this year boosted NVIDIA’s quarterly results.\n\nHowever, despite such promising quarterly results, NVIDIA’s shares dipped 6.4% in Thursday’s trading and were 2.1% lower on Wednesday. This is because the performance expectations were much higher as the NVIDIA stock is currently the S&P 500’s best performer this year.\n\nWhy You Shouldn’t Sell NVIDIA Stock\n\nThe share price drop at the moment is just a blip for NVIDIA. This is because if we look at the broader picture, with the Federal Reserve all set to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, NVIDIA’s capital expenditure outlays on AI-related infrastructure are expected to increase.\n\nAI is a growing field, with the industry expected to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nWhile the Blackwell AI chip launch will give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its peers, its gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce, is expected to help NVIDIA penetrate the growing gaming market. NVIDIA’s initiative to enter the industrial metaverse space with the help of Siemens is also a tailwind for the company.\n\nConcerns With AMD Stock\n\nLike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices also makes semiconductors and is trying to enter the gaming space. However, NVIDIA is way ahead of Advanced Micro Devices, whose latest quarterly revenues were minuscule compared to that of NVIDIA. In the recently reported quarter, Advanced Micro Devices’ total revenues increased just 9% from a year ago.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is investing heavily in AI, but unlike NVIDIA, they are late to the party. Any AI investment takes a long period to generate returns on the invested capital. Moreover, Advanced Micro Devices hasn’t poured money into the necessary AI infrastructure, which can be an issue for the company in the long run.\n\nAnyhow, Advanced Micro Devices is losing the competition with NVIDIA. Per data from Jon Peddie Research, Advanced Micro Devices’ market shares in GPUs have fallen from 35% to 12% over the past decade, while NVIDIA’s shares have risen from 65% to 88%.\n\nINTC Stock – Stands No Chance in the Competition\n\nWhile NVIDIA is in a league of its own, Intel is struggling to compete with Advanced Micro Devices, which has seen some progress in the production of high-performance processing machinery.\n\nIntel is in dire straits after failing to progress in the foundry business. Intel failed to make the most of the ever-expanding AI applications industry, where most of its peers are doing reasonably well.\n\nIntel’s server and networking segment is also being disrupted by Arm Holdings plc ARM. Many of ARM’s designs in the micro server segment have been accepted by Intel’s competitors. Intel’s shares never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst and currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Fundamentals Much Stronger\n\nNVIDIA has generated profits more proficiently than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. This is because the NVIDIA stock has a return on equity (ROE) of 124.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have an ROE of 6% and 1.8%, respectively. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is considered very good.\n\nNVIDIA’s net profit margin is 55%, way more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel’s 5.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Any reading above the threshold of 20% signifies the company has been able to keep operation costs under control and generate profit from sales. As a result, the $2.71 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s earnings per share is up 74.8% year over year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Stock – Trading Above 200DMA\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the NVIDIA stock has been constantly trading above its 200-day moving average (DMA) so far this year, indicating a long-term uptrend. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOn the other hand, the prices of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have fallen below the 200 DMA this year, a tell-tale sign of a persistent downtrend. Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Price Upside for NVIDIA Stock\n\nWith NVIDIA’s shares exhibiting a bullish trend and the stock faring much better than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel in the AI space and beyond, notable brokers have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 13.5% from the stock’s last closing price of $125.61. The analysts’ highest price target is at $200. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, despite the recent hiccups, investors should hang on to the NVIDIA stock more than Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, as AI is here to stay (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Top Stock Reports for NVIDIA, AT&amp;T &amp; Lockheed Martin",
        "content": "Friday, August 30, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), AT&T Inc. (T) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), as well as two micro-cap stocks Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) and Natural Resource Partners L.P. (NRP). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have lost some ground following the beat-and-raise quarterly release on Wednesday, August 28th, with market participants seemingly shrugging the company's raised guidance. But this lack of stock market follow through for the shares could very well be a reflection of the stock's impressive gains over the past year rather than a comment on underlying busines trends.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. \r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. \r\n\r\nHowever, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds. The United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is also a major concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+23.4% vs. +21.7%). The company is expected to benefit from an integrated fiber expansion strategy that improves broadband connectivity, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience. The deployment of O-RAN architecture is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network to reduce huge debt burden. \r\n\r\nWith a customer-centric business model, AT&T is witnessing healthy momentum in its postpaid wireless business with a lower churn rate and increased adoption of higher-tier unlimited plans. However, lower demand for legacy voice and data services is affecting revenues in the Business Wireline vertical. \r\n\r\nDeclining Mobility equipment sales are a concern. Fierce competition in a saturated wireless market will likely strain margins. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome while high debt burden remains a perennial problem.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AT&T here >>>)\r\n\r\nLockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+29.1% vs. +1.9%). The company’s broad product offerings allow it to secure major defense contracts, which in turn boosts its backlog count. Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. \r\n\r\nThe solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Its products also witness a strong international demand from the countries like Germany, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Meanwhile, the company also holds a strong solvency position. \r\n\r\nHowever, Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products that may affect its results. Shortage of skilled labor may adversely impact the company’s operating results. The sanctions imposed by China on Lockheed might also affect its business.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Steel Partners’ have declined -2.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry’s decline of -7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $795.34 million reported strong financial results in second-quarter 2024, with revenues growing 6.4% year over year to $533.2 million and a 113.2% surge in net income to $124.9 million.\r\n\r\nRevenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024 also increased by 6.7% to $1 billion. This growth reflects the company's effective diversification across its industrial and financial services segments. SPLP's operational efficiency is highlighted by a 15.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 14.7% in second-quarter 2023. \r\n\r\nSteel Partners’ balance sheet is robust, with $256.4 million in cash and a $112-million debt reduction in the first half of 2024, enhancing financial stability. Investments in the Supply Chain segment, which saw 192% in revenues for the six months ended Jun 30, 2024, position SPLP for long-term growth, particularly as global supply chains evolve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Steel Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nNatural Resource Partners’ shares have declined -0.4% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Coal industry’s decline of -2.4%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $1.13 billion faces significant risks from its heavy reliance on coal royalties, with metallurgical coal accounting for 75% of second-quarter 2024 coal royalty revenues. \r\n\r\nWeakened steel demand, particularly in China and Europe, is pressuring coal prices, potentially reducing NRP's cash flow. The secular decline in U.S. thermal coal demand, driven by environmental regulations and competition from natural gas, further threatens long-term revenues. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, a surge in Chinese soda ash production is depressing global prices, impacting NRP's profitability. Inflationary pressures, labor shortages, and high financing costs also pose challenges, while stringent environmental regulations and reliance on lessees increase operational risks. Overall, NRP's exposure to volatile coal markets and regulatory risks positions it in a challenging environment.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Natural Resource Partners here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Boeing Company (BA), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW) and MetLife, Inc. (MET).\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Super Micro’s Red Flags Are Stop Sign For Cautious Dip Buyers",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- What was one of Wall Street’s hottest artificial intelligence plays has been pummeled by bad news, with dip buyers staying away as accounting questions hang over the stock.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness Turkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints A Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. shares are on pace for their worst month in nearly six years after allegations of accounting problems by a short-seller and a delayed 10-K filing for which the company said it needed more time to assess its internal controls. A disappointing earnings report earlier in August also roiled the stock.\n\nIt’s a sudden turnaround for a key beneficiary of spending on AI infrastructure. Added to the S&P 500 Index in March, Super Micro shares have since dropped 64% below a peak hit that month. The stock is down as much as 36% this week, including Friday’s drop of as much as 6.5%.\n\nHindenburg Research on Tuesday said it is short the company, as an investigation revealed “glaring accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues.” On Wednesday, the firm said it will delay filing its annual financial disclosures.\n\nA spokesperson for Super Micro declined to comment on the Hindenburg report. Reached for a comment about the filing delay, the spokesperson said that “additional time is needed to assess some internal controls,” and that the company hasn’t updated the announced financial results for its most recent fiscal year and quarter.\n\n“The 10-K delay is only adding to the uncertainty, even if AI servers remain a tremendous business,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “I can see the stock going significantly lower from here.”\n\nOther analysts are souring on the stock. Bank of America on Thursday moved its rating to under review, writing that “the delay in filing and any potential findings from the review leads to more uncertainty, and leaves us unable to assess the fundamentals of the company.”\n\nThat followed CFRA, which downgraded Super Micro after Hindenburg’s report. “While we believe the evidence presented does not conclusively demonstrate significant accounting malpractice or verifiable sanction evasions, SMCI’s delayed 10-K filing and potential reputational damage raises concerns,” it wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nFew are enticed by a valuation that has plummeted to levels that could be attractive under other circumstances. Shares trade below 12 times estimated earnings, a fraction of a recent peak near 40, and a discount to its 10-year average.\n\nIn terms of estimated revenue, Super Micro trades at 0.9 times, making it the third-cheapest stock in the Nasdaq 100 Index by this metric. Two of the most expensive, in contrast, are also connected to AI: Nvidia Corp. trades at 19 times estimated revenue and Arm Holdings Plc tops the list at more than 30 times.\n\nKaufman said the delayed filing exacerbated his broader concerns about how long spending on AI infrastructure will continue to grow at elevated rates. This issue contributed to a 6.4% drop in Nvidia Corp. on Thursday, after the AI-focused chipmaker gave a forecast that failed to live up to the most optimistic hopes.\n\nThis is not the first time Super Micro has faced questions over its accounting. In 2020, the company resolved an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting and disclosures for its fiscal years 2014-2017 by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty, while promising not to commit such violations in future.\n\nFor many, that episode was forgotten as AI took Wall Street by storm. Super Micro sells high-powered servers for data centers, and it has seen an explosion in both sales and investor interest. Revenue growth topped 140% in its most recent quarter, when it also gave a sales forecast that was much stronger than expected. Revenue is seen tripling this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe stock, which soared nearly 250% in 2023, continues to have some defenders. Rosenblatt Securities wrote that “a 10-K delay is not a good look, obviously,” but that “the business remains strong and healthy, and there have been no changes to the company’s financial results.” The selloff, analyst Hans Mosesmann added, “seems over the top.”\n\nOf course, investors who want exposure to AI servers have other options, including Dell Technologies Inc., which on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue on the back of AI server growth. Dell gained 3.4% on Friday.\n\nWhile there’s a chance this could turn out to be a buying opportunity for investors, “that’s still an unknown, and there’s no reason to take that risk when Dell also looks cheap, is also well positioned in servers, and doesn’t have these red flags,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments. “It will take time for Super Micro to earn back confidence, and while you can jump in now, it would really be swim at your own risk.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nA pair of e-commerce companies have seen divergent fortunes this year, with eBay rising 34% in 2024 as of its last close while Etsy has dropped 32%. An exchange-traded fund that tracks online retail is up less than 4%. Online auction company eBay has been supported by better-than-expected earnings, and Bloomberg Intelligence on Thursday wrote that it sees potential for growth in gross merchandise volume and buyer retention. In contrast, Etsy’s most recent report was greeted with caution.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nIntel Corp. is working with investment bankers to help navigate the most difficult period in its 56-year history, according to people familiar with the matter. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has secured the endorsement of China’s antitrust watchdog more than three years after a landmark probe into its online behavior, suggesting Beijing is keen to signal its support for the country’s giant internet sector. Nvidia has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Uber Technologies Inc. aims to expand its South Korean business and take the battle to dominant domestic rival Kakao, highlighting the country’s importance as one of the US company’s few remaining Asian markets. Indian online grocer Zepto’s valuation climbed about 40% to $5 billion in a funding round led by General Catalyst Partners, marking the latest major bet by foreign investors in the country’s e-commerce market.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nPremarket\n\nJinkoSolar\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Need 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG’s estimate of 64 cents.\n\nThe gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter’s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.\n\nData center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia’s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of strong Hopper demand.\n\nDelay of Blackwell chip rollout.\n\nThe full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nCompetition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia’s efforts.\n\nSecond to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia’s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Wall Street closed mixed on Thursday, weighed down by tech stocks. Market participants are waiting for inflation numbers, slated to be released on Friday, that are expected to facilitate the Fed’s interest rate cut decisions. One of the three most widely followed indexes closed the session in the red, one closed in the green and one remained virtually unchanged.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 243.63 points, or 0.6%, to close at 41,335.05. Twenty-eight components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while three ended in negative. This was the benchmark index’s highest-ever close.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 39.60 points, or 0.2%, to close at 17,516.43.\n\nThe S&P 500 declined 0.22 points, remaining virtually unchanged, to close at 5,591.96. Seven of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) increased 1.3%, 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) declined 0.9%.\n\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 8.5% to 15.65. A total of 10.5 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.6 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 2.1-to-1 ratio on the S&P 500.\n\nNVIDIA Earnings Weigh on Markets\n\nThroughout the week, trade has been dominated by expectations surrounding chipmaking giant NVIDIA Corporation’s NVDA earnings call set for after-hours on Wednesday. And while the company did actually report pretty impressive growth, these expectations were so sky-high that the company’s stock fell 6.4% regardless.\n\nNVIDIA’s revenues jumped 122% year over year to $30 billion, up from $13.5 billion. Its data center revenues, the centerpiece of the world’s AI optimism, topped out at $26.3 billion, a 154% year-over-year increase. However, the numbers still fell short of what the market participants were expecting from the tech behemoth. Its stock slid, taking the tech sector down with it.\n\nConsequently, shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM and Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited AOSL fell 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Both currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nInvestors Keenly Await PCE Inflation Numbers\n\nInvestors are keeping a close watch on the Friday release of the Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index for July. Currently, CME’s FedWatch Tool predicts a 67% probability that the central bank would go for a 25-bps rate reduction in its September meeting. Also, a 33% weightage has been provided to a 50-bps rate cut. The PCE numbers would provide a clearer and more definitive picture of the Fed’s policymaking going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomic Data\n\nThe Labor Department said on Thursday that initial jobless claims were 231,000, decreasing 2,000 for the week ended Aug 24 from the previous week’s revised level. The prior week’s number was revised up by 1,000 to 233,000. The four-week moving average was 231,500, marking a fall of 4,750 from the previous week’s revised average. The prior week's average was revised up by 250 from 236,000 to 236,250.\n\nContinuing claims came in at 1,868,000 for the week ended Aug 17, increasing 13,000 from last week’s revised level. The previous week's level was revised down by 8,000 from 1,863,000 to 1,855,000. The four-week moving average was 1,863,250, a decrease of 250 from the prior week's revised average. Last week's average was revised down by 2.000 from 1,865,500 to 1,863,500.\n\nPer the National Association of Realtors, pending home sales for July fell 5.5%. The number for June remained at an unrevised increase of 4.8%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Bitcoin to Gain From Rate Cuts: 4 Crypto-Centric Stocks With Upside",
        "content": "The crypto market is struggling to stage a rebound after a solid first half. On Aug. 27, Bitcoin fell 6%, marking its biggest decline since the turmoil that gripped global markets earlier this month.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin had a great 2023 and hit an all-time high earlier this year. The recent decline is temporary as the cryptocurrency still has immense potential. Given this situation, it would be ideal to watch out for crypto-centric stocks like Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Block Inc. SQ.\n\nBitcoin’s Decline Temporary\n\nBitcoin plunged earlier this month as global markets witnessed a massive selloff triggered by fears that the U.S. economy could slip into a recession. However, the fears were soon eased by some positive economy data that showed a steady decline in inflation.\n\nMarkets rebounded and Bitcoin, along with other major cryptocurrencies, also started staging a rebound. However, the rebound rally came to a halt earlier this week, with Bitcoin price slipping to $58,116 on Aug. 27 from a high of $63,209.\n\nOn Aug. 30, Bitcoin was hovering around 59,600 as it attempted to make a rebound.\n\nBitcoin's current downward trend appears to be driven by the recent selloff, which is influenced by macroeconomic factors and other market trends.\n\nRate Cuts to Boost Bitcoin Stocks\n\nBitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,750 on March 14. The surge this year gained traction after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. This approval was intended to offer both individual investors and large institutions a regulated and accessible way to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the rally lost momentum in April, and even the Bitcoin halving event did not manage to drive up the price.\n\nThe halving event, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half to cap the total Bitcoin supply at 21 million, typically stimulates demand and drives prices higher. Despite this, Bitcoin saw a significant decline.\n\nHowever, a decline in inflation has finally raised hopes that the Fed will soon start its rate cuts. Also, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that rate cuts were on the horizon. Market participants are now expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut in November, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nLower interest rates typically reduce the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t provide yields, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In a low-interest-rate environment, investors are more inclined to seek assets with higher potential returns, even if they involve greater risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe shift makes cryptocurrencies, which are known for their volatility and potential for higher returns gains, more attractive to a wide range of investors.\n\nCrypto-Centric Stocks in Focus\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 35.7% over the last 60 days. Robinhood Markets currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR’s commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.9% over the last 60 days. IBKR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.1% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nBlock Inc. is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Intel's shares rose more than 3% before the bell on Friday, as a report of the struggling chipmaker exploring options that could include a merger or a split induced some investor enthusiasm after one of the stock's worst slumps in decades.\n\nThe company is working with investment bankers and considering various options such as separating its flagship product business from its money-losing manufacturing unit, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.\n\nIntel is also discussing potentially scrapping some factory projects, the report said.\n\nBuilding and expanding chip production sites is at the core of Intel's turnaround efforts focused on becoming a contract manufacturer for other chip firms - a capital intensive undertaking that has strained the company's finances.\n\nIntel's market value was set to rise by nearly $3 billion on Friday, after falling below the $100 billion mark earlier in August for the first time in three decades.\n\nThe report provided some relief to investors, many of whom see Intel splitting its business as an ideal option as the company trudges through the AI era and trails chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD.\n\nIntel's shares have fallen about 60% so far this year, compared with a less than 2% year-to-date drop for AMD. Nvidia's shares have more than doubled in value this year.\n\nIntel's disappointing quarterly report earlier in August, coupled with the company pausing its dividend and announcing layoffs impacting 15% of its workforce, have deepened the stock's slump.\n\nThe stock trades at about 24 times expected earnings, compared with a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.6 for AMD. Nvidia trades at 33.7 times expected earnings.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to Buy the Nvidia Dip? Here Are 2 ETFs You Should Take a Look At",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.\n\nThe best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.\n\nA rising tide lifts all chipmakers\n\nNvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.\n\nFor one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.\n\nThis is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.\n\nSo, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.\n\nNvidia isn't the only megacap that has pulled back\n\nAlthough Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.\n\nCompany (Symbol) Percent Below 52-Week High Nvidia (NVDA) 10.4% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 13.7% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 1% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 2.9% Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10.2% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 23% Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) 13%\n\nData source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that these stocks have become \"cheap\" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio. If you think the pullbacks in companies like Alphabet and Amazon.com have been overdone in addition to Nvidia, this ETF could be worth a closer look right now.\n\nWhich is best for you?\n\nBoth of these are solid ETFs with reasonable fees, and the best choice for you depends on what your investment goals are and what groups of stocks you want exposure to. After Nvidia's latest earnings, if you think the recent pullback has gone a bit too far and want to invest but don't necessarily want to open a large position in Nvidia itself, these two ETFs could be smart choices for your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $769,685!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split AI Stocks Up 455% and 1,150% in 3 Years to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its share price has increased 455% since August 2021, making it the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the last three years. The company completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June to make shares more affordable.\n\nServer manufacturer Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been an even bigger beneficiary of the AI boom. Its shares price has surged 1,150% since August 2021, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 during the last three years. The company will reset its share price with a 10-for-1 stock split in September.\n\nGenerally speaking, Wall Street analysts believe both stocks will be profitable investments during the next 12 months. Nvidia has a median price target of $145 per share, implying 24% upside from its current share price of $117. And Super Micro has a median price target of $693 per share, implying 56% upside from its current share price of $443.\n\nHere's what investors should know about these AI stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia reported blockbuster financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 2024). Revenue increased 122% to a record $30 billion on particularly strong growth in the data center segment. Gross profit margin expanded 450 basis points, and non-GAAP earnings soared 152% to $0.68 per diluted share.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang said, \"Spectrum-X Ethernet [networking] for AI and Nvidia AI Enterprise software are two new product categories achieving significant scale, demonstrating that Nvidia is a full-stack and data center-scale platform.\"\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads such as training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Nvidia regularly sets performance records at the MLPerfs, objective benchmarks that measure the training and inference capabilities of AI systems. And the company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is truly formidable because it offers a full-stack computing platform that spans hardware, software, and services. To elaborate, the company complements its GPUs with high-performance networking equipment and central processing units (CPUs). It also provides software and services that streamline the development of AI applications. In a recent note, Jim Kelleher at Argus wrote, \"Nvidia stands out because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 44% annually through fiscal 2026. That makes its current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. Investors looking to start a position or increase their exposure to Nvidia should consider buying a few shares today.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). The good news: Revenue topped estimates and surged 143% to $5.3 billion due to record demand for AI infrastructure. The bad news: Gross margin contracted 580 basis points to 11.2%, so non-GAAP earnings rose just 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Analysts expected non-GAAP earnings to grow 132% to $8.14 per diluted share.\n\nHowever, management attributed the shortfall to cost associated with ramping direct liquid cooling (DLC) manufacturing capacity. While those investments are a temporary headwind, but they should pay dividends down the road. Super Micro is already the leader in AI servers, but investments in DLC technology could help the company gain market share. Liquid-cooling is more efficient than traditional air cooling, so demand for DLC solutions should increase in lockstep with demand for AI servers, simply because AI servers generate a lot of heat.\n\nImportantly, Super Micro expects its gross margin to normalize between 14% and 17% by the end of fiscal 2025 once DLC solutions start shipping in higher volume. That means profitability should improve in the coming quarters. CEO Charles Liang told analysts, \"We are well positioned to become the largest IT infrastructure company.\" However, shareholders got hit with some bad news this week.\n\nSuper Micro stock tumbled 20% on Wednesday, Aug. 28, following a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research alleging \"accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures.\" But Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase brushed the situation aside in a recent note to clients. \"We see the report as largely void of details around alleged wrong doings from the company that change the medium-term outlook.\"\n\nThe short report from Hindenburg puts investors in a tricky position. Super Micro shares could decline further if evidence of wrongdoing comes to light. Alternatively, the stock could rebound quickly in the absence of such evidence. Personally, I think risk-tolerant investors should consider buying a very small position today. Wall Street expects Super Micro's earnings to grow at 43% annually through fiscal 2026. That estimate makes the current valuation of 20 times earnings look cheap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why Nvidia's New $50 Billion Buyback May Bolster the Bear Case for the Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal second-quarter earnings report is out, and it appears the chipmaker is raking in massive sums of cash. Revenue for the period was $30 billion, up 122% year over year. Even more, earnings per share soared 168% to $0.67. Further, free cash flow for the quarter was about $13.5 billion, up from approximately $6.0 billion in the year-ago period.\n\n\"NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,\" said Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang in the company's quarterly report.\n\nAll of this is great. But in the context of Nvidia's nearly $3 trillion market capitalization, it's not as impressive. Herein lies the problem with Nvidia stock: The valuation may simply be a bit ahead of itself. One telling way to further highlight this is by taking a look at the company's share repurchase program and viewing it next to its massive market cap.\n\nEverything is relative\n\nNvidia repurchased $15.4 billion worth of its shares over the last two quarters. This would leave $7.5 billion of authorized cash for further repurchases, except the company just announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $50 billion for repurchases.\n\nSure, $50 billion is a huge sum. But it's a bit small in the context of Nvidia's approximately $3 trillion market cap. Even when you add in the $7.5 billion it still has from its previous program, total outstanding cash authorized for repurchases amounts to less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap.\n\nCompare this to the $60 billion authorization Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) announced when it got serious about share repurchases in 2013. This amounted to nearly 16% of the company's shares outstanding at the time. Fast forward to Apple's first full quarter following this authorization and the company spent $11 billion buying back its stock. And what was Apple's market cap at the time? Around $400 billion. In contrast, Nvidia spent just about $7.2 billion in its most recent quarter repurchasing shares even though the company's market capitalization amounts to about $3 trillion today.\n\nIn one final comparison with Apple, Nvidia's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently total $34.8 billion, or just over 1% of the company's market capitalization; yet Apple's cash at the time it got serious about repurchases was $147 billion, or more than a third of its market capitalization.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's underwhelming repurchase program (and cash balance to support it) relative to its market capitalization arguably draws attention to the fact that its valuation may be a bit inflated.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestionable timing\n\nThe other issue with Nvidia's repurchase program is the timing. With shares trading at around 55 times earnings, the stock may have already priced in the continued upside for this cyclical business. Repurchasing shares at a potentially fair or overvalued price isn't always in the best interest of shareholders. It may be better for Nvidia to hold onto cash and buy back its stock if it were available for a better price -- a price that looks like a clear discount to a conservative estimate of the stock's intrinsic value.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's business performance is worth applauding. It's incredible how the company has innovated and executed to capitalize on the demand for AI-fueled products and services. Further, the company's growth rate and profitability is astounding. Still, none of this addresses the key concern investors should have: Valuation.\n\nSure, it's possible that the company easily grows into its valuation. But the cyclical nature of semiconductor businesses and the industry's long history of intense competition warrant some caution at the stock's current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has generated life-changing returns for many investors, thanks largely to its connection to artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanded interest in that sector of the economy. If you invested $33,000 into the stock five years ago and held onto it, you would be holding a $1 million investment right now. That's a staggering return in a relatively short time frame, especially when you consider that it was already a formidable, large, and fairly safe company to invest in at the time.\n\nBut given such supersized gains, it's hard not to question just how much more upside this AI stock can achieve from here on out. Five years ago, its market cap was around $100 billion. Now, it's just under $3.1 trillion. I'm sure Nvidia can still rise in value, but expecting it to double or triple within the next five or 10 years seems a bit optimistic, given its already rich valuation. I'm not saying it's impossible, only that it's improbable.\n\nIf you are looking to invest now in the potential of AI, there just might be a better (if perhaps a bit riskier) option than Nvidia that offers much more upside: Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN). Let me explain.\n\nLumen's stock has been scorching hot\n\nLumen Technologies may just be the hottest stock on the market at the moment. In just the past month, it has tripled in value. Lumen is a telecom company previously known as CenturyLink, and recent developments it is involved in make Lumen an intriguing artificial intelligence (AI) play.\n\nLumen doesn't make AI chips, but it is benefiting from AI. What set the stock on fire of late was a deal involving tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft plans to use Lumen's fiber products to help increase its network capacity and enable it to meet heightened demand related to its AI efforts. Through AI and the use of Microsoft's cloud, Lumen expects to bring down its expenses and improve its offerings to customers. By doing so, Lumen management estimates it can add $20 million in cash flow to its operations over the course of the next 12 months.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the Microsoft deal and other ones that Lumen has already secured could be worth $5 billion. Even better, the company is working on additional deals that could add $7 billion more. CEO Kate Johnson doesn't see this as a temporary boost, either. \"Our partners are turning to us because of our AI-ready infrastructure and expansive network. This is just the beginning of a significant opportunity for Lumen, one that will lead to one of the largest expansions of the internet ever.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLumen is a high-risk, high-reward stock that just got a bit safer\n\nWhile Lumen managed some large deals recently, they will span multiple years. And there will be costs associated with the deals, so all that revenue won't go straight to the bottom line. There is definitely some risk here associated with the stock. However, given where Lumen has come from, the upside could be significant if it is able to lock in more deals and remain on its path to turn its operations around.\n\nIt was just a couple of years ago when the company stopped paying dividends, and there were serious questions about its business and long-term future. While the telecom stock is doing exceedingly well lately, over a three-year stretch the stock is still trading down 55%. It's trading at 10 times its trailing earnings and 0.5 times its revenue. The company has incurred a loss in three of the past four quarters, and it has struggled to generate revenue growth.\n\nIf it can close more AI-fueled deals, Lumen's valuation will likely rise higher, given that its share price remains down considerably from where it was just a couple of years ago.\n\nShould you buy Lumen Technologies stock?\n\nIf you're a growth investor looking for a possible contrarian play, Lumen Technologies could make for an intriguing and underrated AI stock to buy right now. It's not a risk-free option for investors, but it's hard not to be a little bullish on its prospects, given that it has secured some large deals and is in talks to initiate a few others.\n\nThe company's future looks a whole lot safer and brighter than it was just a few months ago. It'll involve taking on some risk, but for investors who are comfortable in doing so and buying shares of Lumen, there's definitely room for the stock's valuation to rise a whole lot higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lumen Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lumen Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumen Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's Stock Has Peaked, and 1 Under-the-Radar Performance Metric Proves It",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet roughly three decades ago, investors have pretty much always had a buzzy trend or innovation to captivate their attention. However, none of these other next-big-thing trends came anywhere close to rivaling what the internet did for corporate America.\n\nBut after a long wait, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has left professional and everyday investors wide-eyed with its potential.\n\nAlthough estimates vary, as you'd expect from a game-changing technology, the analysts at PwC see AI adding $15.7 trillion (yes, with a \"t\") to the global economy via various consumption-side benefits and productivity gains by the turn of the decade.\n\nNo company has benefited more directly from the hype surrounding AI and its seemingly limitless ceiling than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's ascension is unlike anything we've ever witnessed\n\nWhen the page turned to 2023, Nvidia was a $360 billion company that was on the fringe of being one of America's most-important tech stocks. But as of the closing bell on Aug. 28, 2024, it was worth $3.09 trillion. In June, it briefly became the most valuable publicly traded company, shortly after completing its historic 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNo deep digging is required to flesh out why Nvidia added, at one point, well over $3 trillion in market value in less than 18 months. In short order, the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) became the preferred chip in AI-accelerated data centers. It's effectively the brain that powers generative AI solutions, facilitates the training of large language models (LLMs), and fuels split-second decision-making by AI-driven software and systems.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's hardware has completely overwhelmed supply. Producing the must-have AI-GPU has afforded Nvidia a jaw-dropping amount of pricing power. Whereas Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is selling its MI300X AI-GPU for between $10,000 and $15,000, Nvidia's H100 generally costs between $30,000 and $40,000.\n\nNvidia's CUDA software platform has played a key role in its success, too. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build LLMs as well as get as much computing capacity out of their GPUs as possible. CUDA has been an indispensable tool that's helped keep Nvidia's customers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThe end result of this seemingly textbook expansion has been six consecutive quarters where the company's reported sales and profits completely trounced the consensus of Wall Street analysts.\n\nBut in spite of this success, one under-the-radar performance metric appears to all but confirm that Nvidia's best days are in the rearview mirror.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first sequential decline in two years for this operating metric spells trouble\n\nAs I stated earlier this week, I wasn't going to be shocked one bit if Nvidia blew past Wall Street's consensus revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for the fiscal second quarter (ended July 28) -- which is precisely what it did. It's not uncommon for analysts to be conservative with their estimates and provide a low enough bar for companies to clear.\n\nBut headline figures, such as revenue and net income, only capture part of the story.\n\nWith Nvidia, the one performance metric that tells a more thorough story about where it's headed is its gross margin. Personally, I prefer to use adjusted gross margin, which removes acquisition-related expenses and stock-based compensation; but either gross margin or adjusted gross margin works fine for this discussion. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded to an almost unthinkable 78.35%. In a span of five quarters, it's risen by close to 14 percentage points, which is a reflection of the company commanding such high price points for its AI-GPUs.\n\nHowever, Nvidia also guided to an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter in its first-quarter report. If it were to hit this range, it would mark the first sequential quarterly decline in adjusted gross margin in two years.\n\nAfter the closing bell on Wednesday, Aug. 28, Nvidia delivered its much-anticipated fiscal second-quarter operating results, with adjusted gross margin falling by 320 basis points to 75.15%. While this is within range of what the company forecast three months prior, it's at the lower end of what was expected.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's fiscal third-quarter outlook calls for the possibility of additional gross margin contraction, with an adjusted gross margin forecast of 75% (+/- 50 basis points).\n\nAlthough its adjusted gross margin is still up substantially from where things stood 18 months ago, there appears to be no question that the tide is turning -- and not for the better. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCompetitive pressures and history are working against Nvidia\n\nEven though Nvidia is selling more of its H100 chips, and CEO Jensen Huang has noted that demand remains strong for its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, the lion's share of its adjusted gross margin expansion has been the result of AI-GPU scarcity and its otherworldly pricing power.\n\nThe first problem is that AI-GPU scarcity will be abating over time. AMD has been increasing production of its MI300X, and it doesn't have the same supply constraints that Nvidia has contended with from leading chip fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). As external competitors enter the space and ramp their output, Nvidia's pricing power will be steadily whittled away.\n\nIt's also highly likely that suppliers are going to want a bigger piece of the pie. Taiwan Semiconductor is in the process of meaningfully expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity, which is a necessity for packaging the high-bandwidth memory needed in AI-accelerated data centers. Increasing its CoWoS capacity is likely to translate into higher costs on Nvidia's end to boost production.\n\nAnd it's not just external competition that this leading AI juggernaut needs to worry about. Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are developing in-house AI-GPUs for use in their high-compute data centers. The H100 and Blackwell GPUs maintaining their computing capacity advantages won't to be enough to dissuade these top customers from using their in-house chips and denying Nvidia valuable data center \"real estate.\"\n\nThe other major issue working against Nvidia is history. At no point over the last 30 years has there been a next-big-thing technology, innovation, or trend that's avoided an early-innings bubble. All technologies need time to mature, and artificial intelligence doesn't appear to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nAlthough Nvidia has enjoyed large orders from its top customers, the overwhelming majority of businesses investing in AI lack a clear game plan. Even Meta Platforms, which is one of Nvidia's top four customers by net sales, has no intention of meaningfully monetizing its AI investments anytime soon.\n\nThis clear lack of direction, coupled with the company's adjusted gross margin forecast, effectively confirms that Nvidia's stock has peaked.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Q2 Earnings Reflect Positivity, But Q3 Estimates Decrease",
        "content": "Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nWith the Q2 earnings season now effectively behind us, we can confidently say that the overall earnings picture remains stable, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, question marks have emerged about the outlook, as estimates for the current period have weakened more than what we saw in the last two periods.\n\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +3.8% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\n\nThe Q3 negative revisions trend is far more extensive than what we had seen in the comparable periods of the preceding two quarters. Estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Medical, Transportation, and Business Services sectors. Estimates for the Tech and Finance sectors have gone up.\n\nAs noted in the context of 2024 Q3, earnings estimates for full-year 2024 have also been coming down lately, with estimates for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down since late June. Sectors suffering the major declines include Business Services, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Transportation, Autos, and others. Estimates for the Tech, Finance, Retail, and Utilities sectors have increased in that period.\n\nWith the Nvidia NVDA earnings release now out of the way, the Q2 reporting cycle is now effectively behind us.\n\nAs we have been noting all along, the profitability picture emerging out of this earnings season was one of steady improvement and stability, with the earnings growth pace reaching its highest level in two years and the dollar level of aggregate earnings reaching a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nOn the negative side of the ledger, companies struggled to beat revenue estimates, and the revisions trend reversed course, with estimates for the current period (2023 Q3) coming down at an accelerated pace.\n\nReturning to the Nvidia report, the chip maker failed to impress the market even though it beat estimates and raised guidance once again. Nvidia’s earnings increased +157.4% from the year-earlier period on +122.4% higher revenues.\n\nWeighing on the market’s reception was the ‘less-than-whispered’ guidance raise and the relatively softer margin embedded in the guidance. Analysts covering the stock have generally been laudatory of the release and see no reason to be concerned about the company’s outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nvidia release completed the Q2 reporting cycle for the Magnificent 7 stocks, which, besides Nvidia, includes Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla. Mag 7 earnings in Q2 were up +35.2% on +14.7% higher revenues, which followed +51.2% earnings growth on +14% higher revenues in the preceding period. Growth is expected to decelerate further in the coming periods, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBut as you can see above, while growth is expected to decelerate, it is still very strong.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8.0% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +7.5%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.3%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Leveraged Nvidia ETF issuers saw trading surge in bearish products ahead of earnings",
        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\n(Reuters) - Interest in leveraged exchange-traded funds that allow investors to profit when shares of Nvidia fall grew steadily ahead of the chipmaker's quarterly results, according to data from some of the companies that issued the products.\n\nNvidia, which in June eclipsed Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, dominates the major stock indexes, making its quarterly results an increasingly high-stakes market event.\n\nIn a sign of investor anxiety about Nvidia's ability to beat mounting earnings expectations, the number of shares outstanding in leveraged inverse ETFs that offer a bearish view on the chipmaker grew far more rapidly in recent months than those offering leveraged bullish exposure, issuer data shows.\n\nThese bearish products are structured to deliver daily returns twice the size of any loss in Nvidia itself, while the bullish ETFs use derivatives to double any daily gain.\n\n\"You can read into that data the changing sentiment about Nvidia's outlook,\" said Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares. \"As Nvidia becomes more volatile, we seem to be witnessing greater interest in taking a position in the bear ETF.\"\n\nNvidia's stock dropped after its quarterly forecast failed to meet investors' lofty expectations.\n\nThe number of shares outstanding in the GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF soared 446% between May 21 - just before Nvidia released its previous quarterly earnings - and Wednesday, when the chipmaker issued its most recent results.\n\nThat compares to a gain in shares outstanding of only 85% for its bull leveraged product, the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF.\n\nThe discrepancy is even more pronounced in similar ETFs issued by REX Shares and Tuttle Capital Management. The number of shares outstanding in the T-Rex 2x Inverse Nvidia Daily ETF has increased tenfold since Nvidia's May earnings report.\n\nLeveraged ETFs tied to other widely-traded stocks such as Alphabet and Microsoft also exist, but the largest and most active are based on Nvidia and Tesla, reflecting the high profile and volatility of both companies' shares.\n\nSome new investors drawn to the leveraged bearish ETFs may be worried about volatility in Nvidia itself as each earnings report drives expectations higher, said Scott Acheychek, chief operating officer of REX Financial. Others see the ETFs as a way to hedge underlying long positions or manage tax obligations.\n\nTo be sure, the bullish products still dominate leveraged Nvidia ETFs in size and growth as measured by dollar value. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF has $6 billion in assets and has attracted $2.95 billion of inflows in the last three months, according to data from VettaFi.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts 2x bearish ETF, in spite of the dramatic relative growth, boasts only $69 million in assets, although it attracted $63 million in inflows in the last three months.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; editing by Michelle Price and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Latin American Currencies Lead EM FX Losses After Strong US Data",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Latin American currencies were the worst performers in emerging markets on Thursday as domestic risks coupled with a stronger dollar and higher US yields continued to weigh negatively on the market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Dense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\n\nMSCI Inc.’s broad gauge of emerging-market currencies remained in positive territory on the back of gains in the Malaysian ringgit and Chinese renminbi. Latin America, where carry trades played a large role in gains earlier in the year, was by far the worst hit region after new GDP data pointed to a stronger US economy. The Mexican peso and the Brazilian real led losses.\n\n“Firmer economic data out of the US drove US real yields higher, supporting a strengthening of the US dollar,” said Gilberto Hernández-Gómez, a strategist at BBVA in New York. “This weighed a bit on Latam FX while commodities provided some counterbalance keeping CLP, PEN and COP depreciation more capped.”\n\nUS gross domestic product rose an annualized 3% in the second quarter, up from the previous estimate of 2.8%, the government said Thursday. The numbers boosted the case for only gradual rate cuts starting next month.\n\nPolitical concerns in some of the region’s major economies also exacerbated the move. In Brazil, the confirmation of Gabriel Galipolo as central bank head brings back fears over the bank’s independence amid endless fiscal concerns, said Benito Berber, chief Latin America economist at Natixis.\n\nWhile in Mexico, the imminent passing of a controversial judicial reform and the strengthening of the ruling party’s majority in Congress have also impacted the peso’s performance.\n\nStill, “we see the MXN reacting more to the volatility coming out of the U.S. regarding activity and monetary policy,” Bradesco BBI’s strategists Rodolfo Ramos and Juan Ponce write in a note on Thursday.\n\nThe Mexican peso is down more than 2.5% against the greenback this week. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the currency’s three-month slide has made it a bargain for investors willing to stomach the market turbulence.\n\nMeanwhile, emerging market stocks posted a third day of losses on waning optimism about the AI-driven tech rally. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropped as much as 0.7% Thursday, but it’s still on track to a third week of gains. The technology sector is following Nvidia Corp., which posted strong quarterly results but presented a weaker-than-expected outlook.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere, the cost of borrowing Turkish liras overnight in the offshore market jumped on Thursday, as traders exited so-called carry positions amid a steady decline in the currency.\n\nFitch Ratings downgraded the island nation of Maldives on Thursday, citing an increased risk of default, as bond investors dumped the country’s debt that has totted up the worst monthly performance in emerging markets.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Brian's Big Idea: Chips Are For Dips",
        "content": "In a former life I used to say that chips are for dips, and that was born out of a general disdain for the semiconductor sector. When I was a research analyst I learned their chip companies would sell product until the next cycle is ready but anything leftover was sold at severe discounts and then usually booked as 100% gross margin sale. I have a fundamental disagreement with that sort of accounting practice and it turned me sour on the entire industry for many years.\n\nA lot has changed since then and now the whole economy seems to be based on one technology company. Granted that this company is the linchpin of the next technology revolution that is AI, the old slogan still rings in my head. Nvidia NVDA Is of course the company I'm talking about and they just reported earnings last night after the close. The report was a good one but was met with selling early on.\n\nBefore the print we had the curious case of Super Micro Computer SMCI which saw a short report come out Monday morning. The report accused the company of having aggressive accounting practices and recognizing revenue that hadn't yet been completed or shipped. The next day the company noted that they were going to delay their 10K annual report and that more or less confirmed the short report. SMCI Dropped more than $100 per share yesterday and tanked more than 25%.\n\nNova (NVMI) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and we take a deep look at this stock including the earnings history, earnings estimate revisions and valuation.\n\nFinally, we take a quick look at Technology Innovators. This is a service run by Andrew Rocco over the last year or so and he has done a great job selecting interesting technology stocks.\n\nThis week, Andrew correctly heeded the warning of the short report and sold his position in SMCI before the big 25% drawdown.\n\nNot only does Andrew provide you with new and exciting stock picks, almost more importantly, he tells you when to sell as well. Reading the tea leaves of the market is hard to due and having a professional on your side like Andrew can make all the difference.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\n\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): Strong Blackwell Ramp in Q4\n\nA close up of a circuit board, its microchips creating a powerful computing system.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company recently posted earnings for the second quarter of 2024, beating market expectations on earnings per share and revenue by $0.04 and $1.3 billion respectively. The guidance numbers for the third fiscal quarter also topped expectations. Multiple concerns about the production ramps of Blackwell, the latest AI chips being marketed by the firm, were also addressed during the earnings call. The CFO revealed that the firm had shipped customer samples of the Blackwell architecture in the second quarter, and the production ramp for the chip was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026.\n\nFollowing the earnings call, Wall Street analysts have reiterated their bullish calls on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. Raymond James raised the price target on the stock to $140 from $120 and kept a Strong Buy rating, noting that Blackwell delays appeared better than feared and management was forecasting a strong ramp in Q4. The advisory further detailed that Hopper demand continued to be healthy with further growth expected in FQ4.\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness Dense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\n\nApple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The round would be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.\n\nIf the discussions move forward, it would mean the three most valuable tech companies are all backing OpenAI, maker of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft was already OpenAI’s biggest funder, having invested roughly $13 billion.\n\nApple has existing ties with OpenAI as well. The iPhone maker is integrating ChatGPT into its new suite of AI features, called Apple Intelligence. Apple also was slated to take a board observer seat at OpenAI — alongside Microsoft — though those plans were dropped in July.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, supplies the critical infrastructure needed to develop and run AI tools like ChatGPT. It’s the biggest maker of so-called AI accelerators, sales of which have soared in the past two years.\n\nRepresentatives for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI and Thrive all declined to comment.\n\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees in a memo Wednesday that the company was seeking fresh capital, without giving details, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been in discussions to raise funding at a valuation at or above $100 billion since at least December, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nThe financing would bolster one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed startups. The runaway success of ChatGPT also has kicked off an arms race among tech companies, which are integrating AI technology across their products and funding other promising startups.\n\nIn her memo to employees, Friar said that OpenAI would use the financing to acquire more computing power and fund other operating expenses, the people said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions with Apple.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Is Sliding. Is It a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign?",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) were heading lower Thursday after the AI chip leader posted better-than-expected results in its fiscal 2025 second-quarter report after the close Wednesday, but the company's beat was not as wide as investors had become used to and management's guidance was on the lighter side. Nvidia also reported a sequential decline in gross margin, indicating that it may have reached the limits of its margin expansion.\n\nThe stock was down by 6.4% as of 3:14 p.m. ET, though many of its AI peers such as Arm Holdings rose, suggesting that some investors were interpreting the report as good news for AI demand broadly, and taking the opportunity to rotate into other AI stocks with more upside. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia plays the expectations game\n\nNvidia delivered another strong quarter: For the period that ended July 28, revenue was up by 122% year over year to $30 billion and adjusted earnings per share soared by 152% to $0.68, both of which beat analysts' consensus estimates.\n\nHowever, its gross margin slipped from 78.4% to 75.1%, which the company blamed on new data center products and inventory write-downs related to the Blackwell platform. It was the first time that Nvidia's gross margin had shrunk in the generative AI era, and it seems to be a sign that its margin expansion has probably peaked.\n\nNvidia's fiscal third-quarter guidance also seemed a bit underwhelming. Management forecast revenue of $32.5 billion, and while that was ahead of the consensus figure of $31.8 billion, it would amount to just 8% sequential revenue growth.\n\nThe company expects to launch its Blackwell platform in fiscal Q4, and that could be causing a modest headwind to Q3 demand.\n\nShould you buy the dip in Nvidia?\n\nIt makes sense for Nvidia stock to take a breather. After all, it's up by nearly 1,000% since the start of 2023, shortly after ChatGPT was launched.\n\nIt now has a market cap of $3 trillion, just behind Apple and Microsoft in the race for the title of the most valuable company in the world, and the expected soaring growth it will experience from AI, at least over the next few quarters, is largely baked into its stock price. It trades at a forward P/E ratio of 43, which is expensive, but reasonable.\n\nThursday's pullback seems like a good opportunity for long-term investors to scoop up shares of Nvidia, as the company still dominates the AI hardware landscape. However, investors may also want to take a cue from those who are rotating out of the stock into AI alternatives like Arm Holdings.\n\nWith its $3 trillion valuation, Nvidia's upside potential is more limited than that of companies like Arm, especially with its gross margin falling and its sequential growth decelerating.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) stock is climbing in Thursday's trading. The company's share price was up 4% as of 11:30 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nIntel stock is gaining ground thanks to the very strong results that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) published in its second-quarter results yesterday. But while Nvidia's Q2 report was enough to power gains for Intel and other players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, they weren't enough to push its own stock higher: The company's share price was down 3.5% as of this writing.\n\nNvidia's Q2 report shows AI demand remains very strong\n\nInvestors were looking to Nvidia's Q2 report to provide indications about trends in the AI market, and the company delivered a wide range of positive indicators. The company reported non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion, which came in significantly better than the average analyst estimate's call for per-share earnings of $0.64 on sales of $28.7 billion.\n\nCrucially, the company's AI-driven data-center segment saw revenue increase 154% year over year to hit $26.3 billion. The performance helped drive overall revenue up 122% compared to the prior-year period. With the company posting an adjusted gross margin of 75.7% in the period, it's clear that Nvidia's advanced processors are still commanding very strong pricing power.\n\nIntel is aiming to become more competitive with Nvidia in data centers, and signs of strong demand in the space suggest that the overall market opportunity has continued to expand. So while Nvidia's Q2 results and forward guidance weren't enough to drive a rally for its stock today, the report has powered gains for many other stocks with exposure to AI trends.\n\nIntel investors actually got a bit of bad news today\n\nWith its last quarterly report, Intel detailed a massive restructuring plan that included laying off more than 15,000 of its employees. Today, it was revealed that Republican Senator Rick Scott had sent a letter to Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger requesting more information about why the company was implementing such dramatic cuts despite being set to receive $8.5 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act and an additional $11 billion in loans.\n\nThe letter suggests that Intel could face additional scrutiny about the grants and loans it is receiving from the Department of Commerce, and that there may be obstacles to the semiconductor company receiving more public funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Beginner Stock You Should Check Out",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other beginner stocks.\n\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\n\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\n\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\n\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\n\nOpportunities and Caution for New Investors Due to Consumer Behaviour\n\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\n\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven’t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\n\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven’t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\n\nThe Market is Healthy but Caution is Advised\n\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\n\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n“According to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\n\nAccording to Bruce Kasman, global growth is steady at 2.4%, with improved recoveries in Western Europe and emerging markets, along with a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Despite this, core global inflation is projected to remain around 3% in 2024, which could limit the potential for policy easing. Kasman warned that achieving inflation control and rate normalization might weaken demand and could interact with political factors to cause further inflation and central bank tightening.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 34%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a tale of innovation, resilience, and strategic evolution which is why it is one of the best beginner stocks to buy. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem in a meeting at Denny's diner in San Jose, the company started with a vision to revolutionize computing through graphics-based processing. Despite early struggles, including the failure of its first graphics accelerator and a near brush with bankruptcy, the company persevered. As of 2024, it is the most dominant player in the GPU market.\n\nThe company’s strategic decisions to diversify into areas like AI, data centers, and autonomous vehicles have paid off immensely. Nvidia's CUDA software platform, introduced in the mid-2000s, played a pivotal role in establishing the company as a leader in high-performance computing and AI.\n\nDespite some setbacks, NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth trajectory has been remarkable, especially after the Gen AI trend that started with the launch of ChatGPT. The company reached a valuation of over $3 trillion in 2024 and briefly became the most valuable publicly traded company.\n\nOn August 22, The Fly reported that Citi maintained a Buy rating on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a price target of $150 in anticipation of the company's earnings report for the July quarter, scheduled for August 28. Citi analysts believe that the company could exceed Wall Street’s revenue projections by about $1 billion, though this would be less than the $2 billion revenue beat it achieved in the previous four quarters. This lower-than-expected beat is attributed to concerns about supply chain issues and delays related to the company's Blackwell chip series.\n\nCiti expects that after the earnings report, analysts will likely revise their revenue forecasts upward for NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) upcoming quarters. The firm also anticipates that the company will address Blackwell-related concerns, providing a positive outlook for 2025. This reassurance is expected to boost investor confidence and potentially push the company’s stock to reach a new 52-week high.\n\nAs of the second quarter, 179 hedge funds held NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares worth $53.67 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the company’s most significant shareholder with 93.437 million shares worth $11.54 billion, as of June 30.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Is Falling Today",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is falling Thursday following the release of the company's second-quarter earnings results. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 3.2% as of 10:15 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia published Q2 results after the market closed yesterday and delivered results that were significantly better than most targets on Wall Street. The company also issued guidance for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. But expectations were sky-high heading into the report, and comments from the investor conference call suggested that investors may have to wait longer for the semiconductor specialist's next-generation Blackwell processors.\n\nNvidia stock is slipping despite great Q2 results\n\nNvidia recorded non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings of $0.68 per share on revenue of $30 billion in the second quarter of its current fiscal year, which ended July 28. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post adjusted earnings of $0.64 on revenue of $28.7 billion. The company's sales were up 122% year over year in the period, and adjusted earnings per share were up 152% compared to the prior-year period.\n\nIt was a fantastic quarter for the business, with AI-related demand spurring another round of big growth from data center customers. Segment revenue surged 154% higher year over year, and high selling prices for graphics processing units (GPUs) and accelerators in the category helped the business post an adjusted gross margin of 75.7%. That was down a bit from the 78.9% margin it posted in fiscal Q1, but it still beat the company's 75.5% target margin and signaled that Nvidia's pricing power on its most advanced hardware remains very strong.\n\nStrong Q3 guidance isn't overshadowing concerns about Blackwell delays\n\nFor the third quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion -- a target that came in ahead of the average Wall Street estimate's call for sales of $31.7 billion in the period. The company also guided for an adjusted gross margin of 75%. While this suggests that gross margin will decline on a sequential quarterly basis, the drop-off here looks very small and should actually be easing pricing-power concerns.\n\nBut despite strong second-quarter results and guidance for Q3, investors are focusing on some uncertainty surrounding the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell processors. The company said that the production of its next-generation chip platform will ramp up in this year's fourth quarter, which suggests that the new processors may miss their initially announced 2024 release window and slip into 2025.\n\nThe possibility of Blackwell being delayed due to a design flaw had already been widely reported prior to Nvidia's earnings report, so the potential for the release being pushed into next year isn't shocking. But expectations were so high heading into the report that investors seem to be focusing on the implication of a relatively short delay over signs that the business is otherwise firing on all cylinders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Analysts maintain Buy rating on TSMC after Nvidia results",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Analysts on Wall Street reiterated their bullish views on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) shares after the latest Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings report.\n\nFollowing the market close on Wednesday, Nvidia shares fell notably after its quarterly forecast failed to meet elevated investor expectations. The stock dropped over 6% after-hours, though those losses halved in Thursday’s premarket trading.\n\nBut despite this, analysts’ comments following the report were largely bullish, based on positive commentary from Nvidia’s management about demand.\n\n“Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the call.\n\nUnsurprisingly, analysts believe this outlook also bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chip manufacturer.\n\nHuang assured investors that Nvidia will have \"lots and lots of supply\" in the fourth quarter, which should help address some of the current supply challenges. That aligns with TSMC’s earlier statement that their CoWoS capacity will double in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAccording to Citi’s estimates, TSMC’s CoWoS capacity increased to 25kwpm by the end of Q2 2024, up from 10-15kwpm in Q1 2024. They project this capacity to reach 35kwpm by the end of the year, with a target of 70kwpm by late 2025.\n\n“Considering its newly announced purchase of Innolux’s Fab in Tainan, we expect TSMC’s CoWoS capacity to further double in 2026 compared to 2025,\" Citi analysts said.\n\nMoreover, Citi highlighted that, in addition to increasing Cloud Service Provider (CSP) investments in AI, enterprise AI demand is also on the rise.\n\nAs a result, the bank estimates that TSMC's AI compound annual growth rate (CAGR) will surpass the company’s guidance of 50%+. It also projects that AI will contribute over 20% of TSMC's revenue in 2024, significantly ahead of the company's earlier guidance of reaching this level by 2028.\n\nIn Q2 2024, high-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue, marking the first time it has contributed more than half.\n\n“We expect Nvidia will continue to be the biggest contributor to TSMC’s AI business and will share over 50% of its CoWoS capacity allocation,” Citi analysts continued, maintaining a Buy rating on TSM stock.\n\nSimilarly, analysts at Bank of America also reiterated a Buy rating on TSMC, noting that the outlook aligns with their expectations.\n\nSpecifically, they pointed out that AI demand remains strong, CoWoS supply is increasing though still limited, and the Blackwell launch is on track for year-end.\n\nStory continues\n\n“NVIDIA suggests abundant return on investment shifting from general-purpose to accelerated computing for the industry, and we see substantial benefits anticipated for TSMC, the go-to supplier of GPU/ASIC ICs and CoWoS packages to benefit significantly from NVIDIA’s robust growth,\" BofA noted.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAnalysts maintain Buy rating on TSMC after Nvidia results\n\nGermany's DZ Bank sees more consumers struggling to repay debts\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic sign deals with US govt for AI research and testing\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The biggest challenge for Nvidia stock in one chart",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) growth metrics aren't impressing Wall Street like they used to.\n\nNvidia reported earnings on Wednesday which showed the company's earnings and revenue grew more than 100% from the prior year. But it also marked the company's slowest year-over-year revenue growth, 122%, in a year, and the rate of growth compared to the prior year was less than half what Nvidia reported in the first two calendar quarters of 2024.\n\nShares were down as much as 3.5% early Thursday morning.\n\nAnd this growth slowdown, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, is the chief concern with the stock right now and why he maintains a Neutral rating on the AI juggernaut.\n\n\"Next year we're going to have, at the very least, decelerating growth and possibly at some point, revenue declines,\" Luria said.\n\n\"Where if you look at consensus estimates, sell-side estimates, they are for the growth to continue at very, very high rates that are very hard to justify considering Nvidia's revenue is these other companies margins.\"\n\nAt some point, Luria argued, the big tech hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Meta (META) are going to slow their spending. And given they represent the lion's share of Nvidia's current AI chip sales, that'd likely be a headwind to future revenue growth.\n\n\"The estimates for next year and the year after that are starting to get way, way out of control,\" Luria said.\n\nNvidia's earnings call was still rather upbeat. CEO Jensen Huang described the demand for the AI leader's new Blackwell chip as \"incredible.\" And plenty of Wall Street analysts remained bullish on the stock as fears about delays on the Blackwell chip were somewhat eased during the earnings call.\n\nBut for investors assessing a stock that has rallied more than 1000% since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, slowing growth appears to be a sticking point. As Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a note to clients, Nvidia's guidance for current quarter revenue of $32.5 billion — plus or minus 2% — appeared to be \"good but not good enough.\"\n\nNvidia's results also didn't surprise Wall Street at the same pace that they had been.\n\nThe company posted its slimmest upside surprise to Wall Street's revenue expectations since the start of 2023. Its roughly 5% beat on earnings per share was the narrowest surprise since before the AI revolution kicked off in 2023, too.\n\n\"The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing,\" Carson Group chief markets strategist, Ryan Detrick wrote in reaction to the earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.” A smartphone with a displayed NVIDIA logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Believes Will Soar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer reflects on Wall Street's favorite GPU maker's remarkable journey and current status in the stock market. After the sharp decline three weeks ago, caused by the sudden sell-off linked to the yen carry trade, the market is rebounding.\n\n\"We’ve had a remarkable run from the lows three weeks ago as we realized that the forced selling caused by the implosion of the yen carry trade is merely temporary.\"\n\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cuts should support this recovery. However, Wall Street has become more selective, and investors are less forgiving of mediocre results now that the market has rallied significantly.\n\n\"Now the Fed is our friend again with rate cuts on the way, starting at next month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At the same time, though, after such a spectacular rally, Wall Street’s gotten a little more discerning. Investors are no longer willing to give companies a pass for less-than-stellar results once we reach more elevated levels. That’s what happens—the exuberance goes away. Now we’re in a tricky moment that feels like a race against time.\"\n\nCramer emphasizes that the current economic climate is uncertain. The economy is slowing, and while the Fed's rate cuts are expected to help, their impact is unpredictable. The effectiveness of these measures and the extent of the economic downturn remain unclear.\n\n\"While the economy is slowing and we know the Fed rate-cut cavalry is riding to the rescue, we just don’t know how effective it will be and how bad things will get before Fed Chief Powell manages to turn the tide—and he will. We need to figure out how quickly the economy will deteriorate and how quickly the rate cuts will work their magic. Both of these are judgment calls, and we don’t necessarily have enough data to decide either way. We never do at this point in what we call the economic cycle.\"\n\nJim Cramer: In my 43 Years on Wall Street, I’ve Never Seen Anything Like This\n\nAccording to Cramer, Nvidia has captured extraordinary attention from investors. He describes it as a groundbreaking company, now valued at $3.2 trillion, a dramatic increase from $580 billion just 18 months ago. Cramer highlights its dominance in the semiconductor industry and its influence on technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.\n\n\"I searched for comparisons and came up grasping at something ethereal to describe this incredible $3.2 trillion company, which was worth just $580 billion 18 months ago. It has captivated not just investors but people far removed from the stock market. It’s almost miraculous how many have had life-changing experiences because of this single stock.\"\n\nDespite its impressive achievements, Cramer notes that the stock's performance will be scrutinized closely. He points out that the company's quarterly results need to surpass high expectations, including significant revenue beats and strong future guidance.\n\n\"But tomorrow, the stock will descend into mere mortality, and I feel compelled to explain why. Why does it hold such a high status, and why can it never fully live up to the hype of its $3.2 trillion market cap based solely on one quarterly report? The quarter is about it beating earnings estimates, topping revenue numbers, and crushing forecasts. The stock has run so high that it needs a $2 billion revenue beat and guidance that’s $2 billion higher than expected, along with a bullish conference call discussing a strong roadmap. And let’s not forget a gigantic buyback because the company has too much cash sitting idle.\"\n\nCramer concludes that the company's technology is so advanced that it’s difficult to fully grasp its future potential. Despite this, he believes the company's achievements should be celebrated, and the stock might still hold significant upside surprises.\n\n\"The bottom line: I don’t want to be poetic, but it excels in ways that are unmatched. We should celebrate its achievements and bring on those upside surprises.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we examine a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with strong potential for growth. We also analyze hedge fund perspectives on these stocks and rank them according to hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA technician in a lab coat carefully testing a modern semiconductor component.\n\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 38\n\nJim Cramer expresses his positive view on ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH), noting that despite a significant drop in its stock price, the company's business is showing strong growth. He believes that while investors are anxiously awaiting\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)'s results, ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) presents a good buying opportunity, especially if NVIDIA reports favorable numbers.\n\n\"I like ARM. This stock has come down a great deal, and yet I think its business is actually accelerating.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s earnings report needed to be perfect for a stock that’s added nearly $2 trillion in market value in the past year. In the end, a broad beat still sparked a selloff.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun\n\nAt issue is Nvidia’s revenue forecast. While easily exceeding the average analyst estimate, the beat was far narrower than investors have grown to expect over the past five earnings reports. That, and an acknowledgment that the new Blackwell chip hit production snags, was enough to send Nvidia shares tumbling in postmarket trade Wednesday, with declines resuming in premarket Thursday.\n\nThe concern is that if Nvidia — the biggest beneficiary of AI spending and a stock central to the S&P 500’s gains this year — is having trouble living up to lofty expectations, that doesn’t bode well for other gear makers. Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. also slipped in premarket.\n\n“It’s not entirely surprising to see it trade down on these results because it is the smallest beat that we’ve seen in a while,” said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest.\n\nThe reaction to the report signals that the AI giant’s valuation may have topped out for the time being, at least until more is known about the availability of the Blackwell chip. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said supplies will be plentiful when manufacturing picks up, but his comments did little to quell concerns.\n\nAfter rallying back from a steep selloff earlier this month amid macroeconomic worries and concerns about the longevity of big spending on AI, Nvidia shares closed on Wednesday priced at 37 times forward earnings. That’s down from a recent high of 44 times in June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia’s forecast for third quarter revenue to be about $32.5 billion exceeded the average analyst estimate by $600 million. Still, that was the narrowest beat since February 2023, back when Nvidia’s market value was around $500 billion. It closed on Wednesday with a market value of about $3.1 trillion.\n\n“AI is still there, but I think people got a little too excited, a little too over-hyped in terms of what we can expect in the near term,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe report capped off a volatile earnings season and showed just how high expectations have become. In the weeks leading up to Nvidia’s results, the chipmaker helped drag the S&P 500 down more than 8% from a July peak before rallying back as concerns about AI spending subsided and readings on the health of the US economy quelled recession fears.\n\nThe results will also do little to reset the company’s valuation. In previous quarters, Nvidia’s large beats on guidance, signaling bigger revenue growth to come, compressed the multiple. After this report, it looks like the ratio relative to projected profits should stay about the same as shares fall and earnings estimates tick up only slightly.\n\nThat may calm some fears about a bubble, at least for now.\n\n“People say these AI hardware stocks are in a radical bubble, but they’re trading under 40 times estimated earnings,” said Tony Kim, lead portfolio manager and head of the global technology team at BlackRock, noting that this contrasted with the more than 100 times forward earnings seen during the dot-com era.\n\nStill, there was still plenty for Nvidia investors to like, with some analysts viewing the share slump as likely short-lived. On top of handily beating second quarter estimates for revenue and profits, the company authorized an additional $50 billion for share repurchases.\n\n“Expectations become more challenging as the superlative becomes mundane,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore noted. “This was still a very strong quarter given the transitional nature of the current environment.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nTop Tech News\n\nOpenAI is getting closer to raising funding at a valuation of more than $100 billion in a round led by Thrive Capital, people with knowledge of the matter said. Huawei Technologies Co.’s revenue grew for the sixth straight quarter after its smartphones gained market share in China at Apple Inc.’s expense.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Investors: 1 Red Flag You Shouldn't Ignore",
        "content": "After nearly two years of skyrocketing returns, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) seems to be finally taking a breather. The stock pulled back after-hours on Wednesday after a robust earnings report. Nvidia beat estimates, but by a more modest margin than investors are used to.\n\nRevenue jumped 122% from the quarter a year ago and 15% sequentially to $30 billion, topping estimates at $28.7 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share surged 152% year over year and 11% from the previous quarter to $0.68, ahead of the consensus at $0.64. That was the narrowest earnings beat the company has had since the generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom began.\n\nNvidia continued to benefit from soaring demand from cloud infrastructure companies, which accounted for 45% of its revenue. Moreover, the broader ramp toward accelerated computing and generative AI continued. The company also gave better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, calling for revenue of around $32.5 billion, up 79% from the third quarter a year ago.\n\nHowever, one blemish in the earnings report likely contributed to the sell-off and shouldn't be overlooked by investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's gross margin takes a step back\n\nOne of the most important metrics in the semiconductor industry is gross margin. Unlike software companies, most of the costs facing hardware companies tend to come from costs of goods sold or the direct costs involved in manufacturing chips and components.\n\nSince the generative AI revolution began, Nvidia's gross margin has rapidly expanded, a sign that the company profits from pricing power and scalability. The chart below shows the company's gross margin through the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in April. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs you can see, Nvidia's gross margins have soared since the start of the generative AI boom, going from less than 65% before AI demand kicked in to greater than 78% in the fiscal first quarter. However, gross margin pulled back in the second quarter, falling to 75.1% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis.\n\nThe company said this was due to a higher mix of new products in the data center segment and inventory write-offs related to the Blackwell launch, but it shows that Nvidia seems to have hit a ceiling with its gross margin expansion. This adds a new risk for the stock, as falling margins would impact profitability. This sequential decline in gross margin translated into slower sequential growth on the bottom line than on the top.\n\nThe company expects gross margin to pull back again slightly in the third quarter to 74.4%-75.0% and is targeting the mid-70% range for the full year, possibly implying more weakness in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy gross margin is key\n\nGross margin is the biggest determinant of overall profitability in the semiconductor industry, and it's a reflection of a company's pricing power and efficiency.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, Nvidia is now significantly ahead of its peers. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNvidia's gross margins are a testament to its strength and competitive advantages in AI, but if competition from AMD and others begins to have an impact on Nvidia, it's likely to show up as lower gross margins first.\n\nWhat it means for investors\n\nConsidering Nvidia's overall growth on the top and bottom lines remains strong, even on a sequential basis, and the upcoming launch of its Blackwell platform in the fourth quarter is expected to drive another surge in demand, the decline in gross margin isn't an emergency.\n\nHowever, investors should be tracking the number in future quarters. If this crucial margin continues to decline, that could precede greater problems in the business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Just Loaded Up on Stocks: 6 Companies She Just Bought",
        "content": "Like the temperature throughout August, the stock buying activity of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, has stayed hot over the past few weeks. According to a recently submitted regulatory filing, Greene, who sits on the Oversight and Reform Committee and the Homeland Security Committee, added shares of six stocks to her portfolio.\n\nIn this round of stock purchasing, Greene increased her exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, picking up shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Greene also scooped up shares of logistics leader FedEx(NYSE: FDX) and pipeline operator KinderMorgan(NYSE: KMI). It's not certain how much Greene invested in each of the stocks, though each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.\n\nThe Peach State representative's interest in AI stocks remains strong\n\nThrough the first half of 2024, Greene added a variety of AI stocks to her holdings, and her enthusiasm for the rapidly growing industry has hardly slowed. Although we don't know the exact reason why Greene clicked the buy button on Alphabet, it's possible that she sense a bargain. Over the one-month period that preceded her purchase, shares of Alphabet had dropped nearly 7%. Addressing the boon that AI has represented for the company's financials, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, stated on the Q2 2024 conference call, \"Year to date, our AI Infrastructure and Generative AI Solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues, and are being used by more than 2 million developers.\"\n\nGreene's investment in Amazon provides her with another layer of AI exposure. The company is recognizing strong growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business as customers turn to it for support with the heavy computing demands stemming from generative AI. Through the first half of 2024, AWS revenue and operating income has grown 18% and 79%, respectively. Amazon has exposure to AI in a variety of other ways, including its $4 billion investment in Anthropic.\n\nAdding to her positions in semiconductor stocks like Qualcomm and ASML, Greene bought shares of Intel and Nvidia, broadening her AI exposure. As with Alphabet, Greene may have sensed, with Intel, the opportunity to pick up a prominent AI stock while it was in the bargain bin. For the month before her purchase, Intel stock had plunged about 35%. In addition to reporting disappointing Q2 2024 financial results, Intel announced that it was suspending its dividend to the chagrin of investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia stock rounds out Greene's AI stock acquisitions. The semiconductor stalwart continues to dominate the AI scene, and it's little surprise that Greene picked up the stock considering her enthusiasm for other AI names. Besides its robust financial health, Nvidia has tremendous growth prospects, making it an obvious consideration for conservative and growth investors alike who are AI-minded.\n\nNo stranger to logistics leaders, Greene bought shares of FedEx, following up on her purchase of United Parcel Service stock earlier this month. Reporting fiscal 2024 financial results in June, FedEx grew both revenue and adjusted EPS about 1% and 9.5%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2023. The company projects low- to mid-single-digit growth for revenue in fiscal 2025 and adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 24%. Plus, the stock's 1.9% forward dividend yield certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nPerhaps interested in procuring more prodigious passive income, Greene added to her position in Kinder Morgan, the largest energy infrastructure stock in the S&P 500. Operating about 66,000 miles of natural gas pipeline and about 9,500 miles of refined products and crude pipelines through the United States, Kinder Morgan is a leading energy stock that is dedicated to rewarding shareholders. Currently, Kinder Morgan stock offers a forward dividend yield of about 5.4%.\n\nShould I buy these stocks?\n\nWhile it's worth noting politicians' stock picks, smart investors know that it's unwise to blindly follow their buys. Instead, it's more prudent to perform one's own due diligence and investigate potential stock picks thoroughly.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia, for instance, are all compelling AI investment opportunities. Intel, on the other hand, may seem interesting to those with long-term investing horizons who can wait for the company to implement their cost-reduction initiatives yet not as appealing to conservative investors looking to mitigate risk.\n\nFor investors looking to diversify their passive income streams, both FedEx and Kinder Morgan are both excellent options providing exposure to the logistics and energy industries, respectively.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If I Could Only Buy 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock Over the Next Decade, This Would Be It (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Believe it or not, semiconductor chips are used for applications well beyond powering smart devices and electronics. For this reason, it's not entirely surprising that semiconductor stocks have been particularly big winners as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution pushes forward.\n\nAmong leading chip companies, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stands out as the 800-pound gorilla right now. But with shares up 651% since August 2022, investors may want to consider what opportunities exist in the chip realm besides Nvidia.\n\nLet's dig into how Nvidia propelled itself into being the world's top chip business, and assess why another stock may be the better buy in the long run.\n\nNvidia is great, but ...\n\nChips known as graphics processing units (GPUs) are used for a host of AI-powered applications such as training large language models, developing autonomous driving software, and machine learning. Nvidia's GPU roster includes its highly popular H100 and A100 chips, and the company's new Blackwell series is already forecast to be a smash hit (but more on that later).\n\nIndeed, Nvidia looks downright unstoppable, with a nearly 80% share of the AI-powered chip market.\n\nNevertheless, I caution investors about going all-in on one company -- even if it is the de facto leader. Below, I'll break down in detail why Nvidia's time at the top may be drawing to a close. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe competitive landscape is beginning to intensify\n\nMany of the world's largest companies are currently customers of Nvidia. In fact, many \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, such as Microsoft, Tesla, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet, have been touted as some of Nvidia's largest customers.\n\nAlthough a customer roster of that caliber is impressive, I question whether it's encouraging. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently explained to investors that his electric vehicle company is exploring ways to compete with Nvidia more directly as Tesla looks to move away from a heavy reliance on H100 chips.\n\nFurthermore, many of the Magnificent Seven companies referenced above have made it clear that they too are investing significantly into capital expenditures (capex) to develop in-house chips.\n\nFor example, I see Amazon's $11 billion data center infrastructure project as a clear sign that the company is looking to increase investment in its Trainium and Inferentia chips.\n\nWhat's amazing is that all of the competitors analyzed above are tangential to Nvidia. Designing semiconductors isn't a core component of any of their businesses.\n\nPerhaps Nvidia's most direct competitor at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). While AMD's growth during the AI revolution hasn't even been in the same universe as Nvidia's, I think those dynamics may soon change.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's momentum has hit some turbulence following a recent announcement that the new Blackwell chips will be delayed due to a design flaw. Although I suspect Nvidia will still sell out of these chips when they finally do hit the market, I think AMD has an opportunity to capture some new business right now.\n\nWith all this said, I think it's only a matter of time before Nvidia's growth begins to decelerate. Subsequently, I would not be surprised to see the stock give back some of its record gains.\n\nThis company stands to win regardless\n\nGiven the sheer number of competitors and the risks that come with commercializing new products and services, you're probably wondering which chip stock I actually do have full confidence in.\n\nEnter chip manufacturing company Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM). You see, Nvidia, AMD, and many others do very little of their own manufacturing. Instead, after designing next-generation hardware, they outsource the actual manufacturing capability to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes products for Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm, Sony, and many more.\n\nAccording to data from Market.us, the total addressable market (TAM) for the global AI chip market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.2% between 2024 and 2033 -- reaching a size of $341 billion.\n\nTo me, Taiwan Semiconductor stands to benefit no matter what company is selling out their chips. Moreover, given the high likelihood of additional GPUs coming to market from big tech and the bullish forecast for the AI chip market more broadly, I see Taiwan Semiconductor as a clear winner over the next several years.\n\nInvestors with a long-term horizon who are looking for alternatives to AI's most obvious opportunities among mega-cap tech may want to seriously consider a position in Taiwan Semiconductor right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 50% and 112%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Stock splits are popular with investors. They make shares more affordable, and can also spotlight quality stocks. That's because splits are only necessary after substantial and sustained share price appreciation, which itself is often indicative of a company with solid financials and compelling growth prospects.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example. The Wall Street Journal has described the chipmaker as \"almost invincible\" because it possesses a durable competitive advantage spanning superior hardware and a robust suite of supporting software. Nvidia shares have surged 780% since January 2023 amid unprecedented demand for artificial intelligence processors.\n\nThe company reset its soaring share price with a 10-for-1 stock split in June, its second split in three years. And Wall Street remains bullish. The stock carries a median 12-month price target of $144 per share, implying 12% upside from its current share price of $128. But certain analysts see more upside in two other stock-split stocks.\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) announced a 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024 and executed the split in July 2024. Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt Securities recently raised his price target to $240 per share, implying 50% upside from its current share price of $160. Celsius(NASDAQ: CELH) announced a 3-for-1 stock split in November 2023 and executed the split that same month. Gerald Pascarelli at Wedbush Securities recently lowered his price target from $85 per share to $83 per share, but the new estimate still implies 112% upside from the current share price of $39.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Broadcom and Celsius.\n\nBroadcom: 50% implied upside\n\nBroadcom specializes in semiconductors and infrastructure software. It is the market leader in data center networking chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom silicon built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, Broadcom helps Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms design custom AI processors, and it recently won a third major customer that Reuters identified as TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nBroadcom is also the market leader in virtualization software due to its acquisition of VMware last year. Virtualization lets businesses manage and utilize IT infrastructure more efficiently by dividing physical hardware into multiple virtual systems. Doing so allows a single physical server to run several operating systems and applications simultaneously.\n\nSince the acquisition, Broadcom has simplified VMware's portfolio, reducing product SKUs from 8,000 to four core offerings. The company is also transitioning all virtualization products to a subscription model. Going forward, Broadcom is focused on upselling clients with VMware Cloud Foundation, a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) solution that brings together virtualized compute, storage, and networking. Forrester Research recognized VMware a leader in the HCI market last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom reported good financial results in the second quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 43% to $12.5 billion due to strong demand for AI infrastructure and VMware's virtualization products. Revenue increased 12% excluding VMware's contribution. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income climbed 20% to $1.10 per diluted share.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow at 24% annually through fiscal 2025 (ends October 2025). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 36.9 times adjusted earnings look relatively reasonable. From that price, Broadcom could return 50% in the next 12 months, but investors that buy shares today should have a timeline of at least three years.\n\nCelsius: 112% implied upside\n\nCelsius develops and sells energy drinks across major retail channels in the United States. It has achieved strong brand recognition in its core geography, and the company is using that momentum to expand globally. It started selling products in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada in the first half of 2024, and sales are expected to begin in Australia, New Zealand, and France in the second half of 2024.\n\nCelsius is the third-most popular energy drink in the United States. The company gained 139 basis points of market share in the past year. Meanwhile, the leading brands Red Bull and Monster Beverage's Monster Energy gained 37 basis points and lost 134 basis points, respectively, during the same period. Put simply, Celsius is gaining ground on the industry frontrunners.\n\nThe company has achieved that success by marketing its beverages as \"the better-for-you, zero-sugar alternative to traditional energy drinks.\" Celsius has thermogenic properties, meaning it increases metabolism and raises body temperature. It is clinically proven to increase calorie burn during exercise, so the brand is popular at gyms and fitness centers.\n\nCelsius reported record financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 23% to $402 million, gross margin expanded 320 basis points, and GAAP net income surged 65% to $0.28 per diluted share. CEO John Fieldly told analysts, \"We believe that we are well-positioned to capture incremental category dollar share.\"\n\nHowever, Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 15% annually through 2026. That estimate makes the current valuation of 39 times earnings look fairly expensive. So, I doubt Celsius can deliver triple-digit returns over the next year, and I would keep the stock on my watchlist at the present time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia: Billionaires Have a New Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Over the last 30 years, no shortage of next-big-thing investment trends have graced Wall Street. Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, no innovation, technology, or trend has come close to having the impact on corporate growth rates as the internet... until now.\n\nAccording to the analysts at PwC, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the ability to increase global gross domestic product by more than $15 trillion in 2030. This is a mammoth addressable market that can support multiple big-time winners. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYet in spite of the euphoria surrounding AI on Wall Street, quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission point to mixed feelings for artificial intelligence-inspired stocks. A 13F provides investors with a concise snapshot of which stocks the smartest and most-successful money managers have been buying and selling.\n\nIn the June-ended quarter, billionaire investors sent shares of AI leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) to the chopping block and decisively piled into what can be considered their new favorite artificial intelligence stock.\n\nNvidia had billionaires running for the exit for a third consecutive quarter\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about the selling activity in Nvidia is it marks the third straight quarter of selling by at least a half-dozen prominent billionaires. The June-ended quarter saw seven billionaire investors lighten their load, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nProfit-taking and the need to diversify are two possible answers as to why some or all of these billionaires felt the need to reduce their stakes in Nvidia.\n\nSince 2023 began, Nvidia's market cap has grown by $2.75 trillion, as of the closing bell on Aug. 23, 2024, which led to the company's largest-ever stock split (10-for-1) in June. This increase is due to the company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) becoming the standard in AI-accelerated data centers, as well as Nvidia possessing jaw-dropping pricing power, which is reflective of enterprise demand for its AI-GPUs overwhelming supply.\n\nBut there are far more reasons than just profit-taking that might explain this ongoing billionaire exodus from Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the more logical conclusions to draw is that at least some of these billionaires are concerned about competitive pressures following its parabolic climb. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU and doesn't have the same chip-fabrication supply constraints as Nvidia. Further, AMD's chip typically sells for $10,000 to $15,000, which is far below the $30,000 to $40,000 Nvidia is commanding for the H100.\n\nCompetitive pressures can manifest from within, as well. Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- have developed in-house AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even though these in-house chips won't have the same computing capacity as Nvidia's H100, they're going to take up valuable data center \"real estate\" and minimize Nvidia's opportunities moving forward.\n\nThese seven billionaire sellers might also be concerned about history. At no point over the last three decades has there been a hyped innovation, technology, or trend that managed to avoid an early stage bubble-bursting event. Without exception, investors always overestimate the utility and adoption of new innovations.\n\nDespite all the buzz with artificial intelligence, very few businesses have well-defined game plans as to how they're going to generate a positive return on their data center investment. This is a glaring warning that investors have, once again, overestimated the uptake of this technology. If and when the AI bubble bursts, no company is likely to be hit harder than Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMove over, Nvidia: This is now the favorite AI stock of billionaire money managers\n\nBut while billionaires were showing shares of Nvidia to the door, they were avidly scooping up shares of what can arguably be described as their new favorite AI stock. A total of seven billionaire money managers were buyers of shares of AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) during the second quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (2,347,500 shares) Israel Englander of Millenium Management (2,096,440 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,880,740 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (865,090 shares)\n\nKeep in mind that the above share counts have been adjusted for Broadcom's 10-for-1 stock split, which occurred after the close of trading on July 12.\n\nJust as Nvidia's hardware has become a staple in high-compute data centers, Broadcom has quickly asserted its dominance as a key AI networking solutions provider. For instance, its Jericho3-AI fabric is capable of connecting up to 32,000 GPUs, with the goal of reducing tail latency and maximizing the computing capacity of these chips.\n\nWhile AI has undoubtedly been a catalyst, the reason I suspect billionaires have made Broadcom their favorite AI stock is that, unlike Nvidia, it's not entirely reliant on AI for growth. If the AI bubble bursts, Broadcom has a multitude of other revenue channels it can turn to as a cushion.\n\nFor example, Broadcom has a leading position as a provider of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Wireless companies have willingly spent billions to upgrade their networks to support 5G download speeds. In turn, this has led to a steady device-replacement cycle that's spurred demand for Broadcom's products.\n\nBeyond smartphones, you'll find Broadcom supplying networking solutions to businesses from all sectors and industries, along with cybersecurity solutions and financial software, to name some of its other ventures.\n\nBroadcom has also leaned on acquisitions as a way to expand its product and service ecosystem, promote cross-selling opportunities, and grow its bottom line. Its $69 billion buyout of cloud virtualization software provider VMware, which closed in November, is a perfect example of Broadcom broadening its reach in private and hybrid enterprise clouds.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Since the start of 2023, a tech rally has boosted countless tech stocks. Advances in high-growth sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the massive potential of companies active in related fields like chip design and cloud computing. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest recipients of the bull run, with its shares up 785% since January 2023.\n\nThe company profited from increased demand for AI chips and its ability to supply its hardware to most of the market. At the start of last year, Nvidia's market cap was $360 billion. Yet, recent growth has seen it become the first chipmaker valued at more than $3 trillion, joining the ranks of companies like Apple and Microsoft.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise raises the question: what company could be next to hit such a milestone?\n\nAs the world's fourth-most-valuable company, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) market cap of $2 trillion puts it in a prime position to be the next company to cross the $3 trillion threshold. The tech giant has built itself into a cash cow with growth catalysts in multiple markets. Meanwhile, the chart below shows its stock is one of the best bargains in tech. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 19% year to date, delivering more stock growth than any of these companies except for Nvidia. Yet, Alphabet boasts the lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio among its peers, indicating its stock offers the most value.\n\nSo, here is an undervalued stock that could join Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\n\nGrowth catalysts throughout tech\n\nAlphabet has a potent position in tech, having expanded to multiple sectors of the industry. Hard-hitting brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google have made Alphabet the go-to for dozens of crucial services. The popularity of these platforms has seen the company amass a significant user base, hosting nine platforms that have achieved 1 billion or more users as of 2023.\n\nAlphabet's dominant role in tech is mainly thanks to consistent reinvestment in its business and willingness to try new ventures. This strategy has led to a long list of now-defunct products, with Google Hangouts, Stadia, and Google Glass just a few. However, Alphabet's readiness to invest in promising industries has also allowed it to achieve lucrative roles in digital advertising, cloud computing, and AI.\n\nThe company has used its massive user base to sell ads on its various platforms, a business that now accounts for 78% of its revenue. The digital advertising industry is worth about $740 billion and is expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, with Alphabet responsible for 26% of all global ad sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest growth driver over the last year has been Google Cloud, with its 11% market share in cloud computing. The platform is expanding quickly, delivering revenue gains of 29% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. Cloud computing has become one of the fastest-growing areas of AI, an industry developing at a CAGR of 37% through 2030.\n\nGoogle Cloud outperformed market leaders Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services in sales growth in Q2 2024 and has shown no signs of slowing. The platform is likely to boost earnings for years.\n\nAlphabet delivers years of consistent gains\n\nAlphabet has a reputation for consistent growth. In fact, an investment of $10,000 in its stock in 2014 would now be worth close to $58,000.\n\nThe tech giant has proven itself to be a king of reliability, suggesting that it's more of a matter of when, not if, its market cap will hit $3 trillion. GOOG Chart\n\nThe last five years haven't been easy for many tech companies, with a worldwide pandemic in 2020 and multiple years of economic uncertainty. However, the chart above shows that Alphabet's earnings and stock price have still delivered triple-digit growth in that time frame.\n\nThe Google parent's free cash flow hit $61 billion this year, proving it has the funds to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals. Its P/E of 24 is shockingly low compared to its peers, indicating now is the time to invest in this undervalued stock that will likely join Nvidia in the $3 trillion club before it's too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia Beats Expectations with $30 Billion Q2 Revenue, Signaling Strong AI Growth\n\nNvidia has once again demonstrated its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The tech giant's recent earnings call, held on Wednesday, August 28, revealed a second-quarter revenue of $30 billion, surpassing initial estimates by a remarkable $2 billion. This impressive performance has sent ripples of optimism throughout the AI industry, potentially setting the stage for a bullish market response as trading resumes on Thursday, August 29.\n\nThe earnings call is eagerly anticipated by investors and analysts alike, as it has significant impact for the AI industry and wider tech sector. CFO Colette Kress announced that the company's revenue figures exceeded projections by approximately 7%, continuing Nvidia's streak of record-breaking quarters.\n\nAdding to the excitement, Nvidia projected even higher revenues for the upcoming third quarter, estimating between $32.4 billion. This optimistic forecast further bolstered investor confidence, with the next earnings call scheduled for November 20.\n\nKress attributed the company's remarkable growth to several factors, including robust GPU sales, mounting anticipation for the forthcoming Blackwell chips, and strong performance in data services both domestically and internationally. Notably, Kress highlighted significant gains in the Chinese market as a key contributor to the company's success.\n\nThe CFO also provided insights into the highly anticipated \"Blackwell\" platform, assuring stakeholders that the new hardware and software suite is on track for release amid strong demand. Production is slated to commence in the fourth quarter and continue into 2026, with revenues expected to climb. Kress emphasized that demand currently outstrips supply, a trend projected to persist into the following year.\n\nDespite the earnings beat, NVDA is down 2.1% on Wednesday’s trading session. Following the earnings release, the stock fell 6.89% in after hours trading, and is currently valued at $116.95. Crypto AI tokens have followed suit, with NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and Bittensor (TAO) trading down 3.54%, 5.55% and 3% respectively.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Stella Qiu\n\nIt is a sea of red in Asia as AI darling Nvidia failed to meet expectations of investors who were not satisfied with its profits, revenue and outlook simply beating the Street.\n\nNvidia shares have rallied more than 150% this year thanks to insatiable demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI), so the 7% drop in its shares after-hours could turn out to be just another dip to buy into the world's second-most valuable company.\n\nHowever, with valuations sky high, it is probably time for some caution. Taiwan-listed shares of chipmaker TSMC slid 2%, Nasdaq futures dropped 0.7%, and Europe is set for a lower open, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures off 0.2%.\n\nNext up, Germany and Spain will publish their preliminary inflation readings for August later in the day. And a few European Central Bank officials will be taking part in some panel discussions.\n\nHeadline inflation is expected to slow to 2.3% for Germany and 2.5% for Spain. Any downward surprises there will feed into the eurozone inflation reading due on Friday and add to the case of consecutive policy easings from the ECB for the rest of the year.\n\nSwaps imply a cut in September is a done deal, but they are less sure about the chance of a move in October and December, pricing in just about 60 basis points of easing by the year end.\n\nThe often volatile U.S. jobless claims report, due later in the day, has also gained prominence after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell declared policymakers do not wish to see further weakening in the labour market.\n\nElsewhere, currency markets were mostly steady in the Asia session. The kiwi dollar rose 0.6% to a fresh 2024 high of $0.6281 after a local survey showed a huge turnaround in business activity fuelled by a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields were also quiet, although the inverted curve between two- and 10-years came within a whisker of turning positive. That would be the first time since July 2022, barring the brief un-inverting during the Japanese market crash earlier this month.\n\nTwo-year yields held at 3.8671%, just 3 basis points higher than 10-year yields.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Thursday:\n\n- Spain, Germany preliminary CPI for August\n\n- U.S. weekly jobless claims\n\n- Panel participation from ECB chief economist Philip R. Lane\n\n- ECB deputy governors Aino Bunge and Olli Rehn take part in panel discussions\n\n- Final U.S. Q2 GDP reading\n\n(Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares mostly fell Thursday as market attention turned to upcoming data on the U.S. economy after Nvidia reported its financial results.\n\nNvidia, one of several companies that have ridden a wave of enthusiasm over artificial intelligence developments, reported earnings Wednesday.\n\nThe results showed a strong profit, but Nvidia stock fell 2.1%, though it is up 153% for the year. The company is one of the most influential stocks on Wall Street, with a total market value topping $3 trillion.\n\nJapan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4% to 38,220.34. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 declined 0.4% to 8,042.10. South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.8% to 2,667.65. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.5% to 17,608.50, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.5% to 2,824.62.\n\nSentiments remained cautious even after the White House said Beijing and Washington will plan for a phone call in the coming weeks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe White House statement said both sides would keep lines of communication open. Worries are growing lately about tensions over Taiwan.\n\nInvestors are looking ahead to Friday, when the U.S. government releases its latest data on inflation with the PCE, or personal consumption and expenditures report, for July.\n\nEconomists expect the PCE, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, to show that inflation edged up to 2.6% in July from 2.5% in June. It was as high as 7.1% in the middle of 2022. The rate of inflation has been easing steadily back toward the central bank’s target of 2% since then, following the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes.\n\nWall Street and the Fed are trying to gauge the resiliency of U.S. consumers amid the squeeze from inflation and high borrowing rates. The central bank is expected to begin trimming its benchmark interest rate back from a two-decade high at its next meeting in September.\n\nStocks on Wall Street closed lower, as a pullback in big technology companies outweighed gains elsewhere in the market. The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, weighed down by drops in Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was coming off two consecutive all-time highs, fell 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, closed 1.1% lower.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 33.62 points to 5,592.18. The Dow fell 159.08 points to 41,091.42. The Nasdaq fell 198.79 points to 17,556.03.\n\nTreasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.84% from 3.83% on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 16 cents to $74.68 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 12 cents to $78.77 a barrel.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 144.52 Japanese yen from 144.44 yen. The euro cost $1.1133, up from $1.1122.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed. Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian chipmaking stocks fell on Thursday, tracking overnight losses in market darling Nvidia after the chipmaker’s guidance on revenue and margins underwhelmed, raising concerns over the AI trade.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell as much as 8.5% in after-hours trade as an underwhelming outlook on current quarter revenue and gross margin largely eclipsed an earnings beat and a $50 billion buyback from the chipmaker.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang also confirmed earlier reports that the firm was facing difficulties in producing its most advanced line of artificial intelligence chips, called Blackwell.\n\nThe news sparked steep losses in Nvidia’s stock, with losses spilling over into Asia, where several chipmakers have direct exposure to the AI giant.\n\nSouth Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) was the worst performers of the lot, dropping 5.6% even as it unveiled a new generation of memory chips aimed at reducing power requirements. SK Hynix is a key supplier of advanced memory chips to Nvidia.\n\nPeer Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), which is also vying to supply Nvidia with memory chips, fell 2.8%.\n\nTaiwan’s TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world’s biggest chipmaking by foundry capabilities and a major Nvidia supplier- fell 2.4% in Taipei trade, after its U.S. shares sank over 3%. Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn (TW:2317), another major Nvidia supplier, fell more than 2%.\n\nJapanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) lost 0.9%, while Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035), the country’s biggest chipmaker, fell 1.5%.\n\nIn China, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981)- the country’s biggest chipmaker and a local competitor for Nvidia, fell 1.3%.\n\nBroader tech retreats as AI trade comes into question\n\nLosses spilled over from chipmaking stocks and into the broader technology sector, as Nvidia’s underwhelming outlook raised questions about just how profitable the so-called “AI trade” was bound to be in the long run.\n\nBefore Nvidia, middling earnings from several of its tech peers on Wall Street had pointed to rising costs and relatively muted returns from investment in AI.\n\nThis notion weighed on broader Asian tech stocks on Thursday. China’s BAT (LON:BATS) trio of Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700)- all three of which have ongoing AI programs- fell between 1% and 3% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nJapan’s SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO:9984)- which is exposed heavily to AI through its tech investments- fell about 2%. Softbank’s unit- the British chip designing firm Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM)- had fallen sharply on Wednesday and extended its losses after Nvidia’s earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian chipmaking stocks sink tracking Nvidia losses\n\nAsian shares track Wall Street futures lower as Nvidia disappoints\n\nAustralia's CBA chief blasts MP for 'misinformation' on card payment charges\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Crashing After Beating “Expectations”?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) just reported its latest earnings results. Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report exceeded expectations, with revenue reaching $30 billion, up 122% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance translated into adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68, surpassing analysts' forecasts of $28.6 billion and $0.64, respectively. Yet, NVDA stock is down around 7% after hours. Why?\n\nTo answer this question, we have to take a look at NVIDIA Corporation's outlook for the current quarter. Here is what the company said:\n\n• Revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\n• GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, gross margins are expected to be in the mid-70% range. Nvidia, Software\n\nPhoto by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash\n\nNvidia's market cap before today's earnings report was $3.1 trillion. This means investors expect NVDA to earn around $140 billion per year once it becomes a more mature company like Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) which is currently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 21. NVIDIA Corporation's quarterly revenue and profit were $30 billion and $16.6 billion respectively though. Is it reasonable to assume that NVDA's quarterly profit can go from $16.6 billion today to $35 billion in a few years and then continue to grow at the same rate that GOOGL's quarterly profit is growing?\n\nInvestors were surprised to see that NVDA projected only an 8% quarterly revenue growth rate for its next quarterly report (vs. 15% for the last quarter). The decline in quarterly revenue growth rate is really concerning and if the decline continues, it will be awfully clear to investors that NVDA will never get to the $140 billion annual profit figure that its current stock price is demanding.\n\nI am Insider Monkey's co-founder and its research director. We have been recommending a long position in NVDA since May of 2023 and the stock's performance has been good to our subscribers. I also personally own a small position in NVDA shares. However, I believe that NVDA's revenue projections have disappointed investors and they are responding by selling their shares. This is a well-deserved crash and NVDA shares might decline even more tomorrow when the markets open. While I acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an AI investment, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Stella Qiu\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares followed Wall Street futures lower on Thursday as Nvidia's results disappointed some bullish investors, while the dollar steadied and the Treasury yield curve came within a whisker of turning positive.\n\nInvestors now await U.S. weekly jobless claims, which have gained prominence given the Federal Reserve's focus on the health of the labour market, as well as inflation readings from Germany and Spain, for clues on rate-cut prospects beyond September.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6% as tech stocks dragged. The Nikkei eased 0.4% while South Korea dropped 0.7%.\n\nNvidia's third-quarter revenue forecast of $32.5 billion surpassed Wall Street estimates, but the results still failed to impress the most bullish investors, who have driven a dizzying rally in its shares.\n\nShares of the AI darling slumped 7.6% in after-hour trading, losing about $236 billion of its market value.\n\nAs a result, Nasdaq futures dropped 1% early in Asia, while S&P futures skidded 0.5%.\n\nNvidia's chip contractor TSMC slid 2.4% when shares opened, dragging the broader Taiwanese market 1.3% down.\n\n\"Nvidia, in some ways, has become a victim of its success, its share price soaring over 180% this year and after beating earnings now in 14 of the past 15 quarters,\" said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG.\n\n\"Whether today's results signal the end of investors' strong affinity for the chipmaker remains to be seen. However, at the very least, the post earnings reaction does suggest it's an excellent time to consider diversifying from Nvidia into other chipmakers.\"\n\nChina's blue chips fell 0.4% for a fourth straight day as disappointing results from Chinese companies highlighted the country's frail economic recovery. UBS on Wednesday cut its 2024 GDP growth forecast for China to 4.6% from 4.9%.\n\nChinese battery maker CATL fell 2% after two top Republican lawmakers sought to have the firm to be added to a restricted list of companies allegedly working with Beijing's military.\n\nU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is wrapping up three days of talks in Beijing intended to ease simmering tensions between the two superpowers.\n\nChinese food delivery giant Meituan jumped 7% after posting a bigger-than-expected 21% rise in second-quarter revenue.\n\nDebt and currency markets were mostly steady in the Asia session. Fed Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said on Wednesday it may be \"time to move\" on rate cuts, but he wanted to see confirmation from the jobs reports and two inflation reports before the September meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe dollar steadied above more than one-year lows, undermined by expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts. Futures have fully priced in a quarter-point cut next month, and even imply a 35% probability of a half-point easing.\n\nThe euro held at $1.113, having dropped 0.6% overnight and failed to break major resistance at $1.12.\n\nTreasury yields were mixed overnight, but the inverted yield curve between two years and 10 years kept steepening to just within a whisker of turning positive. That would be the first time since July 2022, barring the brief un-inverting during the market crash earlier this month.\n\nTwo-year yields held at 3.8692%, having slipped 4 basis points overnight, while 10-year yields were little changed at 3.8368%, just 3 basis points below the two years.\n\nGold climbed again and was just shy of scaling another peak. Gold prices were up 0.4% at $2,512.89 an ounce, just a touch below its record of $2,531.6.\n\nOil edged higher after two straight sessions of declines as concerns about demand from China and the U.S. countered supply disruptions out of Libya. [O/R]\n\nBrent crude futures rose 0.1% to $78.75 a barrel, having fallen more than 3% in the past two days, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 0.2% to $74.69.\n\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Nations building artificial intelligence models in their own languages are turning to Nvidia's chips, adding to already booming demand as generative AI takes center stage for businesses and governments, a senior executive said on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia's third-quarter forecast for rising sales of its chips that power AI technology such as OpenAI's ChatGPT failed to meet investors' towering expectations. But the company described new customers coming from around the world, including governments that are now seeking their own AI models and the hardware to support them.\n\nCountries adopting their own AI applications and models will contribute about low double-digit billions to Nvidia's revenue in the financial year ending in January 2025, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a call with analysts after Nvidia's earnings report.\n\nThat's up from an earlier forecast of such sales contributing high single-digit billions to total revenue. Nvidia forecast about $32.5 billion in total revenue in the third quarter ending in October.\n\n\"Countries around the world (desire) to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country,\" Kress said, describing AI expertise and infrastructure as \"national imperatives.\"\n\nShe offered the example of Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, which is building an AI supercomputer featuring thousands of Nvidia H200 graphics processors.\n\nGovernments are also turning to AI as a measure to strengthen national security.\n\n\"AI models are trained on data and for political entities -particularly nations - their data are secret and their models need to be customized to their unique political, economic, cultural, and scientific needs,\" said IDC computing semiconductors analyst Shane Rau.\n\n\"Therefore, they need to have their own AI models and a custom underlying arrangement of hardware and software.\"\n\nWashington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge chips to China in 2023 as it sought to prevent breakthroughs in AI that would aid China's military, hampering Nvidia's sales in the region.\n\nBusinesses have been working to tap into government pushes to build AI platforms in regional languages.\n\nIBM said in May that Saudi Arabia's Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority would train its \"ALLaM\" Arabic language model using the company's AI platform Watsonx.\n\nStory continues\n\nNations that want to create their own AI models can drive growth opportunities for Nvidia's GPUs, on top of the significant investments in the company's hardware from large cloud providers like Microsoft, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A bounce-back quarter for Salesforce (CRM).\n\nShares of the SaaS company popped 4% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as it bested Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins, and earnings.\n\nThe reaction — and tone around the quarter's performance — is in stark contrast to just three months ago, when the company shockingly missed sales estimates for the first time since 2006.\n\nDemand remains strong, and there are \"big goals\" for operating margins and cash flow, Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance.\n\nSales increased 11% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. The company's Americas segment notched 8% sales growth.\n\n\"I don't think anyone expected a repeat performance of that [last quarter],\" Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdded Miner, \"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin. Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history.\"\n\nThe company maintained its full year sales outlook, but lifted its expectations for operating margins. That may spur enthusiasm that Salesforce's various AI initiatives will boost profits.\n\nTo that end, Benioff teased the coming launch of AgentForce, which features AI sales agents that go beyond chatbots and can resolve customer inquiries. Benioff says more details will be shared in September at the company's closely watched Dreamforce conference.\n\nBut he tells me the service is a higher margin opportunity and will be priced by conversation. Benioff envisions one billion agents in service by the end of fiscal year 2026.\n\nHe also says Microsoft has \"misled\" customers \"that they have to do so much heavy lifting on the technology side.\" Salesforce aims to enable customers to train their models within its platform.\n\n\"They get real value from AI now,\" he says of Salesforce's offerings.\n\n\"One of the biggest initiatives in the field is around monetizing the AI theme within the Salesforce massive installed base. We believe this is a major land grab opportunity that could significantly benefit Salesforce over the coming years and could increase overall revenue by $4 billion+ annually based on our estimates and field work by 2025,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet Sales: $9.33 billion (+8% year over year) vs. $9.23 billion estimate (guidance: $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion Current Remaining Performance Obligations: $26.5 billion vs. $26.31 billion Adjusted Operating Margin: 33.7% vs. 31.94% estimate Diluted EPS: $2.56 (+21% year over year) vs. $2.35 estimate\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat else caught our attention: the outlook\n\nFull-Year Sales Guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion vs. $37.84 billion estimate (prior guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion) Full-Year Operating Margin Guidance: 32.8% vs 32.52% estimate (prior guidance: 32.5%)\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "Why Is Nvidia Stock Down After Reporting Parabolic Growth?",
        "content": "Expectations were high heading into Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal 2025 second-quarter financial report. The company has become the de facto standard bearer for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Its graphics processing units (GPUS) provide the computational horsepower necessary to create the large language models (LLMs) that make generative AI possible.\n\nThe surging demand for AI has propelled Nvidia's stock into the stratosphere. The stock has gained more than 150% so far this year and more than 750% since the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off early last year (as of this writing).\n\nIn recent weeks, however, investors have become concerned that Nvidia has simply come too far, too fast, and they are wondering whether the hectic pace of AI adoption could continue. Nvidia answered that question with a resounding \"yes,\" but given the stock's parabolic gains, blockbuster results simply weren't enough. Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell AI Superchip. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia generated record revenue of $30 billion, which surged 122% year over year and 15% quarter over quarter. This gave rise to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.68. The results sailed past analysts' consensus estimates for revenue of $28.6 billion and EPS of $0.64. Revenue also eclipsed management's forecast of $28 billion.\n\nThe headliner was Nvidia's data center segment -- which includes chips used for AI -- as revenue of $26.3 billion soared 154% year over year and 16% sequentially, fueled by strong AI adoption among cloud computing and hyperscale data center operators.\n\nIt wasn't just AI that fed Nvidia's growth, though the data center segment dwarfed results from the company's other segments (all segment gains year over year):\n\nThe gaming segment grew 16% to $2.9 billion. The professional visualization segment jumped 20% to $454 million. The auto segment climbed 37% to $346 million. Original equipment manufacturer increased 33% to $88 million\n\nNvidia's gross margin of 75.1% was up compared to 70.1% in the prior year quarter, largely due to the company's enormous pricing power. That said, the measure edged lower sequentially from 78.4% in Q1. The company had previously signaled margins would moderate throughout the remainder of the year. CFO Colette Kress cited inventory provisions for its Blackwell chips and product mix for the decline.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that demand for its current Hopper chip \"remains strong,\" calling anticipation for its next-generation Blackwell architecture \"incredible.\" He went on to note that in recent industry testing, Nvidia's Hopper H200 and the Blackwell B200 chips \"swept\" the MLPerf benchmark results for AI inference. Despite the best efforts of its rivals, Nvidia chips remain the gold standard for processing AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nMedia reports suggested that the new Blackwell chips might be delayed by as much as three months due to design flaws, but Nvidia put those fears to rest. \"We shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026.\"\n\nAnother by-product of Nvidia's growth trajectory is the tremendous amount of cash the company is generating, as free cash flow more than doubled to $13.5 billion. As a result, Nvidia is increasing its returns to shareholders. The board of directors approved an additional $50 billion in share buybacks, adding to the $7.5 billion remaining on its existing authorization.\n\nThese factors have combined to fuel a robust outlook for the third quarter. Management is guiding for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 80%. That's a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia has delivered in each of the past five quarters -- but investors have long known that growth of that magnitude couldn't continue indefinitely. Yet, the numbers show investors were seemingly disappointed.\n\nNvidia stock was down roughly 7% in after-hours trading (as of this writing,) but it's too early to tell what tomorrow will bring. Taking a step back, the company's results continue to defy the odds, but a deceleration in its parabolic growth rate was inevitable. Nvidia's star is still burning brightly, and the long-term investing thesis is intact.\n\nTaken together, Nvidia's durable competitive advantage, strong results, and robust outlook show the company still has a long runway for growth ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Q2 EPS Review: Blackwell Update, Buyback, Margins",
        "content": "Nvidia Beats Wall Street Estimates\n\nDespite sky-high expectations, Nvidia (NVDA), the world’s leading chip maker and the second-largest U.S. company, exceeded Wall Street Expectations. Revenue exploded to $30.05 billion versus $13.51 billion year-over-year, trouncing estimates of $28.86 billion. Data center revenue soared to $26.3 billion versus $10.32 billion in the 2023 quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported adjusted EPS of $0.68, beating Zacks Consensus Estimates for a seventh straight quarter. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPer usual, Nvidia laid out a rosy outlook for the future, again upping guidance. However, the quarter was mixed due to a delay in the company’s latest chip (named Blackwell) and a margin slowdown. Read below for more details.\n\nBlackwell Update\n\nGene Munster (@munster_gene), Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management, made an astute observation following Nvidia’s earnings release:\n\n“NVDA first take: the guidance is much better than investors’ first take (stock down). The company guided revenue up ~3% in October, which includes the negative impact of what appears to be a 2–3-month Blackwell delay. In other words, if there was no delay, the guidance would have been measurably higher. Keep in mind the October quarter will also face strong “Osborne Effect” headwinds as some customers delay purchasing in anticipation of Blackwell.”\n\n“The Osborne Effect” describes the drop or slow down in sales that can happen when a company announces a new product too early, causing customers to hold off on buying the current offering and opting to wait for the new one to be released. The term was coined in the 1980s when Osborne Computer Corporation unveiled a new model to replace their current one, which led to a significant decline in sales for the existing version and ultimately played a role in the company’s bankruptcy.\n\nWhile Nvidia is far from seeing a similar fate, Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest and most sophisticated chip, was set to ship in 2024 until there was an issue with the company’s supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).As I discussed in my Nvidia EPS preview, the status of Blackwell would be a critical factor to watch this quarter. The good news for investors is that management largely quelled concerns, saying, “We shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper demand is strong, and shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Announces $50 Billion Buyback Program\n\nNvidia is looking to put some of its massive cash hoard to work with a $50 billion buyback. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShare buybacks, like the one seen in Apple (AAPL), can be bullish because they limit the shares outstanding, drive EPS, and reinforce management’s confidence in the company’s future.\n\nNvidia’s Net Profit Margin Shrinks\n\nNvidia’s net profit margins decreased to 55% from a record 57% in Q1, marking it’s first profit margin decline in two years. The NVDA CFO explained, “Q2 gross margins were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and may continue to be impacted in the future.” Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Charlie Bilello, Creative Planning\n\nI believe this is the one major concern moving forward for NVDA. Demand clearly remains insatiable. However, a sustained slowdown in margins could take some wind out of the stock’s sails. Increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is another potential threat to NVDA’s dominance. Nonetheless, one quarter does not make a trend.\n\nConclusion\n\nNvidia again smashed Wall Street expectations and provided a rosy outlook. Meanwhile, the delay in the company’s highly-anticipated Blackwell chip seems to be a minor hiccup. That said, NVDA longs must monitor profit margins in the coming quarters.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Asian Stocks Set to Slide as Nvidia Disappoints: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia are poised to track their US peers lower on Thursday after underwhelming earnings from Nvidia Corp. dampened the outlook for tech stocks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\n\nEquity futures in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong all pointed to losses, while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index fell 3.6%. Contracts for US shares fell after Nvidia slumped 8% in post-market trading following a sales forecast that disappointed some on Wall Street.\n\nThe outlook threatened to cool an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world’s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom. Asian tech bellweathers Taiwan Semiconductor Co. and SK Hynix Inc. are likely to be weighed by the results.\n\n“Here’s the issue: the size of the beat this time was much smaller than we’ve been seeing,” said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. “Even future guidance was raised, but again not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122%, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this earnings season.”\n\nThe S&P 500 at one point headed toward its worst drop since the Aug. 5 meltdown. The gauge pushed away from that threshold, closing down 0.6%. Wall Street’s favorite volatility gauge — the VIX — surged to around 17. Treasury 10-year yields rose two basis points to 3.83%, while Bitcoin dipped below $60,000.\n\nInvestors will also be keeping a close eye on Chinese equities after the benchmark CSI 300 fell to its lowest since February on Wednesday amid a sputtering economy. UBS Group AG downgraded its forecast for the nation’s growth for this year and the next, citing a deeper-than-expected property market slump that’s yet to see a bottom.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese food delivery service Meituan reported quarterly results that beat estimates, a positive signal for investors increasingly worried about domestic consumer malaise.\n\nThat outperformance stood out during a dismal earnings season for Chinese consumer-oriented companies. This week, PDD Holdings Inc. — long viewed as a beneficiary of China’s consumption downgrade — stunned markets with an unexpectedly gloomy business outlook that drove home the weakness plaguing the world’s No. 2 economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere, Nippon Steel Corp. plans to invest an additional $1.3 billion at plants operated by United States Steel Corp. as the Japanese company steps up efforts to secure union support for a takeover bid that’s been opposed by both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nIn commodities, oil’s slide extended into a third day to trade toward $74 a barrel after a recent geopolitical-driven rally failed to push futures above the 200-day moving average, which is now serving as a ceiling for price gains. Gold held most of Wednesday’s loss in early trading.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nEurozone consumer confidence, Thursday US GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday Japan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday Eurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday US personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.8% as of 7:48 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.4% S&P/ASX 200 futures fell 0.3%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.1123 The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 144.33 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.1295 per dollar The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6784\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 0.5% to $59,022.32 Ether fell 0.5% to $2,525.94\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.1% to $74.44 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "title": "Nvidia Earnings: A Quick Summary",
        "content": "Nvidia NVDA, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited company for the Q2 earnings season, has finally delivered its results. So far, shares have faced an adverse reaction, down in after-hours trading.\n\nLet’s take a quick look at what the company delivered.\n\nNvidia Reports Record Sales\n\nThe AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting a 15% sequential jump from Q1 and an even more impressive 122% year-over-year climb. The company’s sales growth has been remarkable, with this period’s results penciling in the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.\n\nOf course, Data Center results were the true focal point of the release, which again delivered in a big way. Data Center sales reached a quarterly record of $26.3 billion, up 16% sequentially from Q1 and 154% on a year-over-year stack.\n\nJensen Huang was unsurprisingly bullish on the Data Center, stating, ‘Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.’\n\nHe continued, ‘NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.’\n\nThough its gross margin did fall sequentially, the 75.7% print reflected continued margin expansion relative to the year-ago period.\n\nNvidia’s gaming results are also a key area that investors should keep a close eye on in future periods, particularly as AI PCs continue to gain steam. Gaming revenue reached $2.9 billion, reflecting a nice 16% year-over-year climb from the year-ago period.\n\nConcerning the outlook for Q3, Nvidia expects sales of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively.\n\nShould You Buy Nvidia Shares?\n\nNvidia NVDA has finally delivered its Q2 results, with the reaction post-earnings negative so far despite posting another record-breaking release that re-confirmed robust demand. The stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, and short-term price movements should be ignored by those with a long investing horizon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Prediction: This Under-the-Radar Tech Stock Will Outperform Nvidia and Apple by 2030",
        "content": "Tech giants Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are on top of the world nowadays. They are the two most valuable stocks on the market, looking back at market-beating returns in the past five years. Apple's total returns delivered a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that period. Nvidia soared even higher with a 100% five-year CAGR. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been mighty kind to Nvidia's investors.\n\nThey achieved these massive gains in a strong era for the general market, but the S&P 500 index looks downright sleepy by comparison: AAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt would be cool if Nvidia and Apple were poised to continue their market-beating ways from here. Invest in the biggest, baddest names on the market, sit back and relax, and let them deliver more of the same good stuff for years to come. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that both stocks are a bit overvalued at today's massive market caps -- $3.1 trillion for Nvidia and $3.4 trillion for Apple. I know it's like comparing mountains of cash to rivers of revenues, but these two market caps add up to about 23% of America's gross domestic product.\n\nI think that's too much. Apple and Nvidia may be overdue for a painful correction. At best, I don't expect them to rise much higher in the foreseeable future.\n\nAt the same time, good old International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is gaining ground in the AI space, and its stock is undervalued today. I don't expect IBM's stock to pass the trillion-dollar mark in the next five years, but it should most certainly rise as Big Blue's enterprise-class AI tools add value to the stock. Most investors don't see this traditional computing giant as a promising AI investment yet. That's a big mistake.\n\nDon't forget IBM's cash-profit chops\n\nIBM's valuation ratios don't look terribly exciting at first glance. The stock is changing hands at 22 times trailing earnings and 2.9 times sales. Those are perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road values for mature companies, just below the averages seen in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average market indices.\n\nThen your eye slides over to IBM's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio, and the stock suddenly looks different. When you calculate IBM's values based on its massive cash profit, the stock seems to belong in Wall Street's bargain bin instead. This ratio stops at 14 times free cash flows, just over half of the S&P 500's or Dow Jones' readings.\n\nCash is king, and IBM has plenty of it. The company's rich cash profits and relatively modest bottom-line earnings show that Big Blue's accountants are very good at lowering taxable profits while putting lots of real greenbacks in the bank. I see cash flow as a higher-quality measure of profitability, so it's easy to look away from IBM's moderate price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM's place in the AI boom\n\nRemember the five-year chart I showed you? IBM's chart for the same period is a different animal: IBM Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe stock has underperformed broad market indices for many years as it transformed a hardware-heavy business model into a more profitable software and services plan. In particular, you should know that the revamped Big Blue comes with a heavy focus on cloud computing, data security, and AI tools.\n\nYes, this company was a leading AI researcher long before ChatGPT's release opened the floodgates for AI investments. Many investors seem to have missed that connection since IBM's business results didn't immediately skyrocket in this soaring AI era. The big AI contracts are coming, just a bit late.\n\nYou see, IBM is happy to leave consumer-friendly ideas such as ChatGPT-style chatbots to other tech providers. This company will always go after large corporate contracts instead, adding extra layers of security, business-friendly data analytics, and lawsuit-repellant data tracking to the mix. Potential clients may take several quarters to test and approve the resulting AI recipe, but the end result is a lucrative long-term deal that won't be easy to replace.\n\nThe approvals are rolling in now, building a robust revenue stream for the long run. Market makers are still not paying attention, so IBM's stock keeps trading at incredibly low cash flow ratios. I can't wait to see what happens in a couple of years, when the AI contracts have become generous and highly profitable revenue streams.\n\nOne more thing...\n\nI'll admit that Nvidia and Apple are making solid cash profits, too. However, their sky-high stock prices already account for these high-quality profits. Apple's P/FCF ratio stands at 33 today, and Nvidia's is soaring at 79 times free cash flows.\n\nThanks, but no thanks. I'd much rather buy IBM's undervalued stock instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Has Delivered Another Blowout Quarter and Looks Poised for More Big Wins",
        "content": "After the market closed today, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) published results for the second quarter of its current fiscal year -- which ended July 28. The red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) company has once again delivered big sales and earnings beats.\n\nNvidia's revenue surged 122% year over year, and its non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share rocketed 152% higher to hit $0.68. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate as polled by LSEG had called for the business to report sales of $28.7 billion and earnings of $0.65 per share.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) leader beat the midpoint Wall Street sales target by 4.5% and the midpoint earnings target by 6.25%. The company also crushed its own guidance, which called for revenue of $28 billion and an adjusted gross margin of 75.5%.\n\nNvidia serves up more huge wins in data center AI\n\nNvidia's data center segment was once again the standout performance driver in Q2. Segment sales increased 154% year over year to hit $26.3 billion and accounted for 87.7% of overall revenue. Sales were also up 16% on a sequential quarterly basis. With tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet investing heavily to remain at the forefront of artificial intelligence, demand for Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPU) has been sky-high.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become the foundational hardware powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, and the company has a stark performance lead when it comes to delivering processors to power today's most advanced artificial intelligence applications. Thanks to the dominance of its CUDA software platform for utilizing GPUs for AI and other accelerated computing applications, the company has created an ecosystem with a clear-cut performance edge and high switching costs. If the company can continue pairing meaningful hardware advantages with industry-standard software tools, its competitive moat will be very tough to breach.\n\nWhile competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, are trying to gain share in the data center GPU market, there's little sign that either is dampening Nvidia's momentum in the space. Some estimates put the company's share of the AI GPU and accelerator market at 95% or higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's other segments also contributed to the blowout quarter\n\nWhile the data center segment was the key standout and performance driver, Nvidia's other segments also posted encouraging results. Sales for the gaming segment increased 16% year over year to $2.9 billion and made up roughly 10% of quarterly sales in the period. Meanwhile, sales for the professional visualization segment rose 20% year over year to hit $454 million, and revenue from the automotive and robotics segment jumped 37% to hit $346 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe sales contributions from these other segments may seem relatively small compared to what's happening in the data center, but they're still significant. Lofty expectations from Wall Street analysts and other investors mean that Nvidia needed to be firing on all cylinders with its Q2 report, and the company has delivered.\n\nWhat comes next for the red-hot AI leader?\n\nIn addition to blockbuster Q2 results, Nvidia issued performance targets for fiscal Q3. The company is guiding for sales to come in at approximately $32.5 billion -- suggesting annual growth of around 80%. Management is also guiding for an adjusted gross margin of 75% and adjusted operating expenses of roughly $3 billion.\n\nAs with its Q2 results, Nvidia's forward guidance looks very encouraging. The AI frontrunner's sales guidance comfortably exceeds the average analyst estimate's call for revenue of $31.7 billion in the period, and its gross margin target suggests that the business is seeing little erosion of pricing power when it comes to data center GPUs and accelerators. For comparison, the business posted an adjusted gross margin of 78.9% in this year's first quarter and a margin of 75.7% in Q2.\n\nNvidia is now shipping samples of its next-generation Blackwell chips, and the company expects that the new hardware will be its most successful product ever. While there's still some uncertainty about the release timing for its first Blackwell processors, the new platform is poised to be a major driver of sales and margins. Nvidia has passed the test with its recent quarterly report, and the company has never looked stronger.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia has once again turned out quarterly results that easily exceeded Wall Street's forecast s. The company has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence applications.\n\nRevenue more than doubled in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, Nvidia said Wednesday. The company expects further revenue growth in the current quarter that ends in October. Investors will be watching to see if demand for the company's products can maintain its red-hot pace.\n\nThe company’s journey to be one of the most prominent players in AI has produced some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look.\n\n$3.156 Trillion\n\nNvidia’s total market value as of the close Wednesday. It's ahead of Microsoft ($3.076 trillion) but behind Apple ($3.457 trillion) in the battle for most valuable company. One year ago, the company's market was around $1.15 trillion.\n\n154%\n\nGain in Nvidia's stock price so far this year as of the close of trading Wednesday.

Overall revenue rose 122% from a year ago to $30 billion. By comparison, revenue growth for all the companies in the S&P 500 is expected to be about 5% for the latest quarter.\n\n$32.5 billion\n\nNvidia's estimate for overall revenue in the third quarter, “plus or minus 2%.” That translates to a range of $31.85 billion to $33.15 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimate of $31.7 billion. Revenue in the year-ago third quarter totaled $18.1 billion.\n\n$121.1 billion\n\nAnalysts’ estimate for Nvidia’s revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January 2025.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Emerging-market currencies edged down on Wednesday as the dollar rebounded from the near eight-month low it hit at the end of last week, while equity traders awaited cues from Nvidia Inc.’s results later in the day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun\n\nMost currencies in the MCSI Inc.’s emerging-market gauge were down on the day. The Polish zloty led the decline after the government proposed a looser budget for 2025, while in Latin America the Colombian and Chilean pesos fell with commodity prices.\n\nOne of the few exceptions was the Mexican peso, which rebounded from an almost two-year low following reports that President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum won’t rush a judicial reform bill through congress. The currency gained as much as 1.7%, though it remains the worst performing in emerging markets this month after the Russian ruble.\n\nTraders are now focusing on fresh US economic data that could shed light on the outlook for Fed interest rate cuts.\n\n“There is some recognition that the US economy is neither in recession nor on the brink of recession, and the Fed may not have to be moving in 50 bps clips come September, November,” said Brendan McKenna, an emerging markets economist and FX strategist at Wells Fargo. “So markets, at least today, are pricing a more gradual pace of Fed easing, pushing the dollar higher and most of EM FX weaker.”\n\nEven as money markets price in 100 basis points of interest-rate cuts by the Fed this year, investors remain on alert for renewed strength in the greenback given the risks surrounding US presidential elections and global geopolitics.\n\n“Given that Powell hasn’t shifted the odds firmly in favor of a 50 basis-point cut by the Fed at the September meeting, some market participants are of the view that the dollar has weakened excessively,” said Piotr Matys, a senior analyst at InTouch Capital Markets. “Domestic factors also set the tone for EM currencies,” including the Mexican peso.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index was down almost 0.3%, with Asian tech stocks partially offsetting losses in Chinese companies. Investors are waiting for Nvidia’s results amid a raging debate over whether companies investing in artificial intelligence will realize the promised profit upsides quickly enough.\n\n“With plenty of focus on Nvidia’s earnings — some say are more important than remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell — it’s worth noting that this critical stock sets the tone for the entire tech sector and other asset classes,” Matys said.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere, the Turkish lira traded slightly weaker against the dollar. A brief and sudden plunge in the currency during Asian hours left traders scratching their heads and rushing to cut losses, before the currency settled on a more predictable path.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel’s central bank held interest rates steady at 4.5%, in line with estimates, in an effort to balance a weakening economy against inflationary pressures as war spending surges.\n\n“Even if Nvidia disappoints and we have a risk-off move, I still think that the clear statement by Chair Powell on the start of the Fed easing cycle will dominate EM local bonds and currencies,” said Rajeev De Mello, a money manager at Gama Asset Management.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom, gave a revenue forecast that fell short of some of the most optimistic estimates, stoking concern that its explosive growth is waning.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\n\nThird-quarter revenue will be about $32.5 billion, the company said Wednesday. Though analysts had predicted $31.9 billion on average, estimates ranged as high as $37.9 billion. The company also signaled that it was working through production snags with its highly anticipated new Blackwell chip, weighing on the shares in late trading.\n\nThe outlook threatens to tamp down an AI frenzy that has transformed Nvidia into the world’s second-most-valuable company. The chipmaker is the key beneficiary of a race to upgrade data centers to handle AI software, and its sales forecasts have become a barometer for that spending boom.\n\nThe shares fell about 4% in extended trading after the report was released. They had more than doubled this year through Wednesday’s close, following a gain of 239% in 2023.\n\nComing into the announcement, there was concern that Nvidia was having problems with its new Blackwell design. Nvidia acknowledged that there were issues with production, saying that it was making changes to improve its manufacturing yield — the number of functioning chips that come out of factories. At the same time, the company said it expects to bring in “several billion dollars” of revenue in the fourth quarter from the product.\n\n“The anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,” Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\nNvidia is coming off a string of quarters that shattered Wall Street expectations — even as analysts continued to raise estimates. But most of that growth has come from a small group of customers. About 40% of Nvidia’s revenue stems from large data-center operators — companies like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. — which are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure.\n\nThough Meta and others have increased their capital expenditure budgets this earnings season, there’s been concern that the amount of infrastructure being put in place exceeds current requirements. That could lead to a bubble. But Nvidia’s Huang has maintained that this is only the beginning of a new era for technology and the economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations are lofty. Nvidia has been the best performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, eclipsing gains by all other semiconductor stocks. At a market value of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth roughly the same amount as the next 10 largest chipmakers combined.\n\nNvidia made its name by selling video-game cards, but is now best known for so-called AI accelerators. These chips, derived from its graphics processors, are used to develop artificial intelligence software by bombarding it with information.\n\nThe process, known as training, makes AI models better at recognizing and responding to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nLast quarter’s topped Wall Street projections, and the Santa Clara, California-based company’s board approved an additional $50 billion in stock buybacks.\n\nNvidia’s revenue more than doubled to $30 billion in the second quarter, which ended July 28. Excluding certain items, profit was 68 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $28.9 billion and earnings of 64 cents a share.\n\nNvidia got a jump on other chipmakers because its technology was well-suited to the needs of AI. But rivals are trying to catch up. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is now its closest competitor, with Intel Corp. — once the world’s biggest chipmaker — trailing further behind. Their combined revenue from the market is only about 5% of Nvidia’s total.\n\nNvidia’s data-center division — now by far its largest source of sales — generated $26.3 billion of revenue last quarter. Gaming chips provided $2.9 billion. Analysts had given targets of $25.1 billion for the data-center unit and $2.79 billion for gaming.\n\nBlackwell is expected to generate a fresh wave of growth when it rolls out in the second half of the year. Analysts have downplayed concerns about delays, noting that the company still enjoys huge demand for its current generation of products. That could help Nvidia cope with any delays without a big financial hit.\n\n(Updates with more results in 13th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Reports Bullish Q2 But Stock Drops\n\nLeading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced better-than-expected results in Q2 CY2024, with revenue up 122% year on year to $30.04 billion. Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was also optimistic at $32.5 billion at the midpoint, 2.3% above analysts’ estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.68 per share, improving from its profit of $0.27 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Find out in our full research report.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $30.04 billion vs analyst estimates of $28.75 billion (4.5% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $19.94 billion vs analyst estimates of $18.9 billion (5.5% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.68 vs analyst estimates of $0.64 (5.7% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2024 is $32.5 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $31.77 billion Gross Margin (GAAP): 75.1%, up from 70.1% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 81, down from 148 in the previous quarter Free Cash Flow Margin: 44.9%, similar to the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $3.15 trillion\n\n“Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible... NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang and two former Sun Microsystems engineers, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading fabless designer of chips used in gaming, PCs, data centers, automotive, and a variety of end markets.\n\nProcessors and Graphics Chips\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nSales Growth\n\nNvidia’s revenue growth over the last three years has been incredible, averaging 88.2% annually. As you can see below, this quarter was especially strong, with revenue growing from $13.51 billion in the same quarter last year to $30.04 billion. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy). Nvidia Total Revenue\n\nNvidia had a fantastic quarter as its 122% year-on-year revenue growth beat analysts’ estimates by 4.5%.\n\nNvidia’s management team believes its revenue growth will continue, guiding to 79.4% year-on-year growth next quarter. Analysts expect the company to grow its revenue by 53.3% over the next 12 months.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nProduct Demand & Outstanding Inventory\n\nDays Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. Nvidia Inventory Days Outstanding\n\nThis quarter, Nvidia’s DIO came in at 81, which is 23 days below its five-year average. At the moment, these numbers show no indication of an excessive inventory buildup.\n\nKey Takeaways from Nvidia’s Q2 Results\n\nWe were impressed by Nvidia’s improvement in inventory levels this quarter. We were also excited its revenue and EPS along with next quarter's revenue guidance topped Wall Street’s estimates. These results were driven by strong performance in its data center segment.\n\nZooming out, we think this was a solid quarter, but the market was likely expecting an even bigger beat given the momentum in the stock. Nvidia's shares traded down 3% to $121.90 immediately after reporting.\n\nSo should you invest in Nvidia right now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "AI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating expectations on the top and bottom line, and beating on anticipated guidance for the coming quarter.\n\nFor the quarter, the company reported earnings per share of $0.68 on revenue of $30 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.64 and revenue of $28.8 billion. That's a massive increase from the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.\n\nThe company also provided third quarter revenue guidance of $32.5 billion plus or minus 2%, analysts were looking for $31.9 billion.\n\nIn a statement, CEO Jensen Huang said anticipation for the company's next-generation Blackwell chip is \"incredible.\"\n\nShares of the chip giant were down 6% immediately following the announcement.\n\nThe bulk of that revenue came from Nvidia’s all-important data center business, which brought in $26.3 billion in the quarter versus Wall Street's expectations of $25 billion in revenue. That's a 154% increase from the same period last year when segment brought in $10.3 billion.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters.\n\nAccording to CFO Colette Kress, Nvidia anticipates several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4.\n\nNvidia’s rivals aren’t resting on their laurels. Earlier this month, AMD announced it is acquiring ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. The move gives AMD more firepower to build out AI system servers, something that’s been a major catalyst for Nvidia’s own sales.\n\nAnd while it could provide AMD with a boost in sales, it doesn’t mean Nvidia will face any major threats to its reign as the AI king anytime soon.\n\n\"There are emerging competitors like AMD that are starting to take a little bit of market share,\" Stifel managing director Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance Monday. \"But when you look at the overall infrastructure spend cycle … which we think is going to continue to increase, Nvidia appears to us as the best positioned to benefit from [spending].\"\n\nNvidia's gaming division, which used to stand as the company's breadwinner, saw revenue of $2.8 billion up 16% year-over-year.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer suggests that perhaps we are misjudging the retail sector. He argues that the debate over whether consumers are sick, well, frugal, or stressed might be misguided. According to Cramer, consumer behavior doesn’t shift dramatically overnight; people don’t suddenly change from being sick to well within a single quarter. As we look ahead to the Fed’s discussion at Jackson Hole on Friday, with the market averages rising by 56 points and the S&P 500 increasing by 42%, it’s clear we need to reassess our views on the consumer’s state.\n\n“Maybe we’re looking at retail all wrong. Perhaps this whole discussion about whether the consumer is sick, well, frugal, or stressed is just a big pile of manure. The consumer doesn’t change their behavior overnight; they don’t get sick and then recover within a single quarter. As we consider what the Fed will discuss on Friday at Jackson Hole, with the averages inching up 56 points and the S&P 500 advancing 42%, we need to rethink the great debate about the state of the consumer.”\n\nJim Cramer points out that understanding consumer behavior is crucial for predicting when the Fed might cut interest rates. He explains that the Fed needs to lower rates before the economy worsens to the point of needing urgent intervention. However, the Fed can’t act if the economy is performing well.\n\n“This debate is central to what the market needs to see for rate cuts. We first need to understand that the Fed has to start cutting interest rates before the economy deteriorates to a point where they need to scramble to fix things. However, they can’t act if the economy is doing fine. The aggregate retail sales data is inconclusive, so we often try to extrapolate from individual retailers. Taken together, these retailers seem to suggest that the consumer is fickle and perhaps tapped out.”\n\nJim Cramer argues that the current debate about consumer behavior might be misguided. He believes that consumers are not as fickle as some suggest. Instead, they are shopping at stores led by successful retail CEOs like Ron Vachris, Doug McMillon, Ernie Herman, and Brian Cornell.\n\n“Tonight, I’m arguing that the consumer is not fickle at all. People are shopping, and they’re shopping at places where great retail CEOs are making a difference, like Ron Vachris at Costco, Doug McMillon at Walmart, Ernie Herman at TJX, and Brian Cornell at Target. These are the places people are choosing to shop. The consumer isn’t frugal or tight-fisted; they’re simply shopping where they prefer, and these outstanding merchants are drawing them in.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

        "title": "Is Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) the Best Affordable Tech Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other affordable tech stocks.\n\nUndoubtedly, technology continues to change rapidly. In a tech-rich world, investors and analysts have a lot to pick from. As we all know, Artificial Intelligence (Al) dominated conversations over the last couple of years.\n\nUS stocks have seen some revival from their recent lows as the economic data has provided confidence about the health of the US economy. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has seen a run-up of over ~19% on a YTD basis. Much of this rally in the IT space was led by optimism about AI technology. However, some hints about the rate cuts also supported the broader increase.\n\nAs per the latest data, the global Al market has been pegged at $196.63 billion (according to estimates from Grand View Research). This exhibits a rise of ~$60 billion since 2022. This growth stemmed from increased practical use cases of Al technology, ranging from content creation to self-driving cars.\n\nGrowth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR)\n\nAl should continue to advance rapidly, with an improved focus on areas including natural language processing, computer vision, and generative Al. PWC reported that ~45% of total economic gains by 2030 should come from product enhancements, fueling consumer demand. Al is expected to drive greater product variety, with higher personalization, attractiveness, and affordability. The greatest economic gains from Al are expected to be in China (26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (14.5% boost). This equates to $10.7 trillion and will account for ~70% of the global economic impact.\n\nExtended Reality (XR), which is known as the convergence of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), is expected to create immersive experiences throughout industries, mainly in gaming and entertainment. The increased use of smartphones, higher adoption of smart electronic devices, and deployments of 5G technology are expected to act as key growth drivers of the extended reality market in North America.\n\nNotably, media companies have explored the possibility of using XR technology as a medium to tell stories and as an advertising outlet for numerous years. The interactive ad campaigns and product visualization components of XR should help drive growth in the advertising industry.\n\nCybersecurity Technology – Need and Emergence\n\nThe cybersecurity technology market has been pegged at US$190.4 billion in 2023, and this should touch US$298.5 billion in 2028 (according to data from Markets and Markets). This represents a CAGR of ~9.4%. Such healthy growth is expected to stem from the increased sophistication of cyber threats, the expansion of the digital landscape, and the pressing need for data protection. Therefore, cybersecurity solutions like data encryption, firewalls, and antivirus software are being used to protect and transfer data.\n\nStory continues\n\nTechnologies ranging from AI, machine learning (ML), and automation are being widely used in cybersecurity technology to improve threat detection and predictive analytics. The higher demand for industrial robots together with the growing adoption of managed security services should help create new opportunities in the market. Also, robotic cybersecurity solutions tend to protect endpoints and connectivity stacks help in preventing data leaks and asset downtimes.\n\nTrends in Robotics\n\nRobotic automation has seen wide acceptance throughout industries because of the introduction of digitization and the Industry 4.0 revolution. As a result, there has been a drastic change in traditional production and operational procedures. In Industry 4.0, smart factories are developed in a way that the machines can collaborate with human workers and other machines in real-time. This is done by using cloud computing, IoT, and cyber-physical systems.\n\nThe emergence of numerous techniques focused on production control and the introduction of automation solutions continue to make the key components of present production improvement policies. Apart from this, the awareness of industrial robots led to their deployment across manufacturing and healthcare industries. Moreover, demand is majorly driven by higher labor charges, which has prompted manufacturers to replace human labor with machines. Notably, Asia and Europe are tagged as the key growth regions of the world.\n\nGrowth in smart factories or smart manufacturing is expected to stem from rapid digitalization across varied industries and higher demand for industrial automation. A further factor that is expected to support growth over the next few years is the extensive use of manufacturing execution systems (MES) along with sophisticated data models for process-specific operations. The market for smart factories continues to see traction due to the increased use of reconditioned industrial robots and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Is Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) the Best Affordable Tech Stock to Buy According to Analysts?\n\nA team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)\n\nForward P/E as of 23 August: 18.05x\n\nUpside Potential: 13.01%\n\nExpected EPS Growth This Year: 58.3%\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells server solutions based on modular and open-standard architecture.\n\nThe company has announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which will be effective from 1st October. This split will take the stock price from ~$630 to $63 per share. While NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is getting all the attention, primarily because of the AI-fuelled rally, several other companies continue to benefit from the same factors.\n\nFor example, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has started getting some traction as its products, ranging from data center hardware to complete racks, continue to see healthy demand.\n\nTwo of the main factors should continue to provide a competitive edge to Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Firstly, the company’s servers appear to be highly configurable. This means that its servers can be tailored to handle a workload of any size. Secondly, its servers are more energy-efficient. This is extremely important because energy input costs are quite high over the life of a server.\n\nFor 1Q 2025, the company expects revenue in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion, exhibiting a growth of 183% to 230% growth. For FY 2025, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) aims $26 billion to $30 billion in revenue. This means a YoY growth of 74% to 101%. This market continues to expand at a rapid pace, and the appetite for the company’s products is following the trend.\n\nWedbush restated a “Neutral” rating and gave a $800.00 price target on shares of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) on 2nd August. In the second quarter of 2024, there were 47 hedge funds holding positions in Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) as compared to 35 in the previous quarter according to Insider Monkey’s database.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\n“The second largest contributor to the Portfolio’s relative performance was Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), a provider of high- performance, energy-efficient servers, which the Portfolio does not own. The stock declined notably in the quarter, providing a tailwind to relative performance. On a YTD basis, however, Super Micro is still our largest relative detractor, given its robust 1Q return.”\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 8th on our list of the best affordable tech stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves tour a Morrisons supermarket in Wiltshire during the general election in June - Hannah McKay/Reuters\n\nRachel Reeves has “no good reason” to raise taxes, a top economist has warned, as he cautioned that the Chancellor risked crushing the economic recovery with too much gloom.\n\nKallum Pickering, chief economist at City investment bank Peel Hunt, said Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer had “over-egged the misery pudding” at a time when the economy was growing strongly.\n\nHe wrote in an investment note sent to clients: “The gloomy narrative is at odds with the prevailing economic backdrop. Private sector balance sheets are healthy, labour markets are strong, and UK economic growth in the first half of the year was the strongest in the G7.\n\n“Reacting to the improving economic situation, consumer and business expectations are recovering nicely. The government should be trying to nurture these green shoots of growth. Instead, its overly downbeat commentary may undermine confidence and frighten consumers and businesses into needless caution.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer said in a speech on Tuesday there was a “deep rot” in society, including a “black hole” in public finances that will require “difficult decisions” to address. He warned that the upcoming budget would “be painful”, widely seen as laying the groundwork for tax rises.\n\nMr Pickering said: “While it makes sense to try to balance the books gradually as the economy recovers, there is no good reason for the government to undertake a sudden fiscal tightening. Inflation is under control, the economy is recovering, and the government has the confidence of markets.\n\n“Now is the time for a soft-touch approach that nudges consumers towards increased consumption and businesses towards more investment.”\n\nHis warning came as shares in banks tumbled on fears of another tax raid on the industry.

Our retail editor Hannah Boland reports:\n\nThe former Spice Girls singer, her husband David Beckham and private equity firm Neo Investment Partners provided a cash injection of £6.9m to Mrs Beckham’s fashion and beauty businesses in the 2024 financial year, recently filed accounts show.\n\nOf this, £3m went to her fashion label to meet working capital requirements as it launched new ranges of bags and belts. Another £3.9m was spent on boosting inventory levels in Victoria Beckham Beauty.\n\nThe latest accounts showed Victoria Beckham Holdings made a loss of £3m last year, compared to £3.3m a year earlier. The holding business acts as the umbrella company for the luxury fashion brand Victoria Beckham as well as her skincare brand.\n\nDavid Belhassen, a director of the company and founder of its shareholder Neo, said work was underway to make sure the empire was being built “on ever stronger foundations”.\n\nRead the full story...

The chemicals sector led gains, up 1.4pc to a more than two-month high. The insurance sector also boosted the index, rising 1.2pc.\n\nConsumer confidence data for the Eurozone is due Thursday, as are consumer price reports from Germany and Spain. A key inflation print for the Euro zone is expected Friday, with investors watching the data for further cues on monetary policy.\n\nThe European Central Bank meets in September and markets have priced in a quarter percentage point rate cut, though policymakers have emphasised the need for improving inflation data.\n\nEurope’s technology sector pared early gains and was flat ahead of industry heavyweight Nvidia’s second-quarter results expected after the close of US markets.\n\nThe company’s performance serves as a crucial indicator of market trends with even a slight miss likely to hurt sentiment around artificial intelligence-related companies, even as European stocks have broadly recovered from a US tech-led global equity selloff in early August.\n\nEuropean chip stocks were mixed, with ASM International and STMicroelectronics down 0.7pc and 0.9pc, while ASML rose 0.7pc.\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nBanks ‘about as easy a target as you can get’, says analyst\n\nBanking stocks dropped today on fears that Rachel Reeves might impose heavier taxes on the sector.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, summed up a common view shared this afternoon:\n\nIt’s about as easy a target as you can get. No one is going to shed any tears if the banks are forced to hand over more of their profits.\n\nBanks have made big money from higher interest rates, profiting when the rest of the country has struggled through a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nIf the oil and gas industry can be slapped with a windfall tax as a result of a spike in energy prices, so can the banks as a result of higher rates.\n\nInvestors didn’t like their chances and were quick to sell down shares in NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC.\n\n05:16 PM BST\n\nNo good reason to raise taxes, Reeves told\n\nRachel Reeves has “no good reason” to raise taxes, a top economist has warned, as he cautioned that the Chancellor risked crushing the economic recovery with too much gloom.\n\nKallum Pickering, chief economist at City investment bank Peel Hunt, said Ms Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer had “over-egged the misery pudding” at a time when the economy was growing strongly.\n\nHe wrote in an investment note sent to clients:\n\nThe gloomy narrative is at odds with the prevailing economic backdrop. Private sector balance sheets are healthy, labour markets are strong, and UK economic growth in the first half of the year was the strongest in the G7.\n\nReacting to the improving economic situation, consumer and business expectations are recovering nicely. The government should be trying to nurture these green shoots of growth. Instead, its overly downbeat commentary may undermine confidence and frighten consumers and businesses into needless caution.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said in a speech on Tuesday there was a “deep rot” in society, including a “black hole” in public finances that will require “difficult decisions” to address. He warned that the upcoming budget would “be painful”, widely seen as laying the groundwork for tax rises.\n\nMr Pickering said:\n\nWhile it makes sense to try to balance the books gradually as the economy recovers, there is no good reason for the government to undertake a sudden fiscal tightening. Inflation is under control, the economy is recovering, and the government has the confidence of markets.\n\nNow is the time for a soft-touch approach that nudges consumers towards increased consumption and businesses towards more investment.\n\nHis warning came as shares in banks tumbled on fears of another tax raid on the industry. A former Whitehall insider told the Financial Times that the sector would be a likely target as lenders have been making “good profits out of higher interest rates” and “no one likes banks.”\n\n04:58 PM BST\n\nFTSE 100 ends the day flat\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed almost flat today, while its mid-cap counterpart fell 0.4pc.\n\nThe biggest riser among the blue-chip index of 100 top companies was Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, up 3.1pc, followed by BAE Systems, up 2.1pc.\n\nMining company Antofagasta was the biggest faller, down 6pc, followed by JD Sports, down 4.1pc. The major banks were among the biggest fallers, with NatWest losing 3.3pc, Barclays dropping 2.7pc, Lloyds losing 1.7pc and HSBC losing 0.2pc.\n\nAmong the FTSE 250 members, the top riser was Genus, up 5.4pc, followed by Trustpilot, up 4.1pc.\n\nHochschild Mining fell the most, down 8.4pc, while cement company RHI Magnesita fell 6.3pc.\n\nThe market has a “wait-and-see mentality”, said Patrick O’Hare, an analyst at Briefing.com, because Nvidia “is primed to move. Everybody knows that. What they don’t know is which way. So, the market is operating in a guarded fashion.”\n\nThe market could be in for a rough ride if Nvidia disappoints, analysts said.\n\n“This is the one that could either lift all boats or sink the entire fleet,” said analyst Stephen Innes in his Dark Side Of The Boom newsletter.\n\nNvidia has seen profits soar thanks to demand for its powerful GPU chips, which have set the industry’s pace in pushing new advances in artificial intelligence.\n\n04:43 PM BST\n\nTraders send Nvidia shares down ahead of results\n\nNvidia shares fell by as much as 4.4pc today as traders brace themselves for the chipmaker’s results, due out this evening.\n\nThe shares, which are currently down by 2.8pc, are a bellwether for the whole tech industry.\n\nNvidia’s market value has ballooned, thanks to its dominance of the computing hardware behind artificial intelligence. The stock price is up some 3,000pc since 2019 and with a market capitalisation of over $3 trillion, a move in its share price affects the broader market.\n\n“Everyone is thinking about Nvidia’s earnings later today,” said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital in Los Angeles, adding that there was perhaps more apprehension about the numbers than about Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last Friday.\n\nHe added:\n\nAs Nvidia goes, that’s an indicator for the rest of the technology industry. And technology as an industry is an indicator for the rest of the market because many sectors are now technology dependent.\n\nAny disappointment in Nvidia’s results could hurt megacaps and other semiconductor stocks, which have led 2024’s rally on the prospect of AI integration boosting corporate profits.\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nEuro zone bond yields dip\n\nEuro zone government bond yields fell slightly after rising yesterday as investors waited for Nvidia’s earnings after the US market close and for European inflation data on Friday.\n\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone bloc, fell to 2.262pc from 2.294pc yesterday.\n\nMohit Kumar, chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, said:\n\nToday the focus would be on the earnings with Nvidia reporting later today. It’s light on the data front.\n\nChip-maker Nvidia has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence-driven stock market rally, and investors will pore over its results for clues about the longevity of the AI boom.\n\nConfidence in AI wobbled at the start of August, contributing to a stock sell-off that sent investors towards safe-haven government bonds.\n\nEuro zone inflation data is then due on Friday and is expected to show price growth in the bloc slowed to 2.2pc year-on-year in August, down from 2.6pc in July.\n\n04:17 PM BST\n\nCrowdStrike shares drop as investors worry over consequences of global outage\n\nShares in the company behind a worldwide Microsoft Windows outage last month have fallen 2pc this afternoon, hours before the cyber-security company is due to release its results.\n\nThe outage occurred after CrowdStrike issued an update containing faulty code to its Falcon cyber defence software, which rendered around 8.5m Windows PCs and servers using it inoperable.\n\nMark Crouch, market analyst at investment platform eToro, said:\n\nThis latest set of results will give investors their first chance to pore over the hard numbers and quantify the impact of that calamitous patch.\n\nExpectations are unsurprisingly depressed to some degree, with the consensus of Wall Street analysts just below the company’s own guidance ...\n\nThis set of earnings provides an opportunity for the company to win back the confidence of investors if it is able to demonstrate that demand is holding up for its cybersecurity suite of products in terms of contract renewals, particularly the now infamous Falcon platform.\n\nIn a statement on its website, CrowdStrike said that it apologised “unreservedly” for the outage.

But it remains unclear how many oil fields are really going offline.\n\nMeanwhile, worries about tensions in the Middle East seem to be easing.\n\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, said:\n\nOil prices have been unable to hold on to their gains lately, and yesterday’s drop has been followed up with more declines.\n\nTraders have been on edge waiting for a renewal of conflict between Iran and Israel, but so far this has failed to materialise, leaving oil bulls with little to cling to.\n\n03:49 PM BST\n\nDairy giant warns over higher milk prices\n\nDairy giant Arla has said shoppers are expected to witness higher milk prices later this year due to commodity cost increases.\n\nThe Cravendale maker warned that “uncertainty” across the market has resulted in lower availability of milk globally.\n\nThe co-operative, which supports thousands of farmers across the UK, said it expects current volatile market conditions to continue into the second half of its financial year.\n\nHowever, it said consumer spending was strong in the face of pressure on budgets in 2024 so far. It said:\n\nThe positive trend on consumer purchasing power from the first half of 2024 should prolong into the second half, especially in Europe as inflationary pressure continues to subside and wages increase.\n\nThis is anticipated to translate into a continued upturn in demand for dairy, although it is uncertain how consumers will react to the expected higher retail price levels following the commodity price increases.\n\nThe warning came as Arla hailed “robust” trading over the first half of 2024, boosted by its brands, including Lurpak and Arla Protein.\n\nArla said it witnessed overall volume growth of 11pc across its brand portfolio, with branded revenues up 5.4pc as higher volumes were partly offset by a slowdown in dairy pricing.\n\nLurpak sales were particularly strong over the past half-year, the food and drink firm said.\n\nBas Padberg, managing director of Arla Foods UK, said:\n\nWhilst we expect consumer confidence to remain into the second half of the year, trading conditions will be more challenging than we have seen in recent months as commodity markets rise again and we balance reduced global supply with the increasing demand for dairy.

The last 18 months have seen the insurer’s shares fall by more than half, currently lumbering at a twelve-year low.\n\nInflationary pressures and higher interest rates have acted as a constant drag throughout that period. Yet it is Prudential’s heavy exposure to Asia, where consumer demand has been severely shaken post-pandemic, that is the primary reason behind the insurer’s dismal performance ...\n\nUltimately the Pru will require a swift and significant turnaround in the Asian and specifically the Chinese economy to recover. However, with growing concerns looming over China’s property sector, it’s uncertain whether or not that recovery is close at hand.

The company said bills could rise to £696 if given extra spending allowances by the regulator.\n\nThe average bill in 2025 to 2030 would be £638 under the proposal – which would suggest an increase of £200 per year as average bills in 2023 to 2024 were £433.\n\nOfwat, the water industry’s regulator, had suggested Thames Water could raise bills by 23pc over 2025 to 2030. But Chris Weston, Thames Water’s chief executive, said such an increase would leave the company in too poor a shape to attract much-needed investment.\n\nRead the full story...

It would also prevent the turnaround and recovery of the company.”\n\nThames Water now wants to push through an average annual bill increase of 52pc by 2030 - an increase on its prior plans.\n\n01:43 PM BST\n\nTed Baker to relaunch online following mass store closures\n\nThe collapsed retailer Ted Baker is to relaunch its online business in the UK thanks to a deal struck by its US parent.\n\nIt comes after Ted Baker’s remaining UK stores were forced shut this month following the collapse of the chain’s UK operator No Ordinary Designer Label into administration earlier in the year.\n\nThe fashion brand’s American parent, Authentic Brand Group, said on Wednesday it had inked a deal with a new business partner, United Legwear & Apparel, to manage Ted Baker’s online retail business in the region.\n\nBoth Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct, and Next were reported to be eyeing separate deals with the chain following its administration, but neither came to pass.\n\n01:19 PM BST\n\nWe don’t offer alcohol deals at airports, says Wetherspoons boss in defence of pre-flight drinking\n\nThe boss of Wetherspoons has defended pre-flight drinking as he said the pub chain removed two-for-one alcohol deals and “shooters” from airport menus “years ago”.\n\nSir Tim Martin said Wetherspoons’ airport pubs no longer served shots such as Jägerbombs, adding that alcoholic drinks made up just a third of sales at these sites over the past four weeks.\n\nHe said: “We’ve had no complaints about our pubs from the airport authorities or airlines that I’m aware of in recent years.\n\n“Years ago we stopped selling ‘shooters’ at airports, as well as ‘double-up’ offers. Ryanair in contrast offers a discount on Irish whiskey if a double is ordered.”\n\nOur transport editor Christopher Jasper has the latest:\n\nIt comes after Michael O’Leary, the group chief executive of Ryanair, called for a two drinks per passenger limit at airport bars to curb drunken disorder on flights. Mr O’Leary said this was one of his chief recommendations to the new Labour Government.\n\nOver the past four weeks, the height of the summer travel season, Wetherspoons’ airport pubs derived only 33pc of sales from alcohol, Sir Tim said. A total 25pc of sales came from soft drinks, tea and coffee, with the remainder from food purchases.\n\nSir Tim said: “Coffee volumes, which include free refills, approximately match lager volumes at our airport pubs.”\n\nWetherspoons operates The Windmill pub at Stansted Airport, Ryanair’s biggest base, and also has three outlets at Gatwick and two at Heathrow, all but one of them located after passengers have cleared security checks.\n\nRyanair identified four airports – Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh – as being particularly problematic for in-flight rowdiness.

However, data from RAC Fuel Watch shows the delivered wholesale price of petrol averaged 103p a litre last week.\n\nAllowing for a retailer margin of 10p – 2p more than the long-term average of 8p, this should lead to average petrol prices of just under 136p including VAT, RAC argued.\n\nDiesel should be being sold for 139p, rather than the current average of 147p.\n\nRAC analysis reveals that the UK has now had the questionable honour of having the most expensive diesel in Europe for 16 of the last 17 weeks, and that’s even with a 5p fuel duty discount.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: “The biggest retailers’ refusal not to reduce their prices to fairer levels is continuing to cost drivers dear.\n\n“It is all the more outrageous when you factor in that we’re all meant to be benefitting from a temporary 5p cut in fuel duty, that looks likely to disappear in the coming months.\n\n“While the Competition and Markets Authority has clearly stated drivers were overcharged last year, it’s blatantly apparent from our data that this problem is persisting this year.\n\n“If prices don’t fall dramatically in the next week or so, we believe the government and the CMA should get all the biggest retailers together to demand an explanation. Tough action needs to be taken to change this as drivers are losing out badly every time they fill up.\n\n“Artificially high pump prices also contribute to a higher level of inflation – so if prices were nearer where they should be, inflation would be lower, benefitting borrowers and the wider economy.”\n\n10:13 AM BST\n\nPolestar boss steps down amid EV slowdown\n\nThe boss of electric vehicle (EV) maker Polestar has stepped down after seven years in post, as the manufacturer grapples with a slowdown in demand for EVs.\n\nPolestar said on Wednesday that Thomas Ingenlath, who has led the company since 2017, would be replaced by Michael Lohscheller, the former chief of Stellantis-owned carmaker Opel.\n\nIt follows a split between Polestar and its former financial backer and owner Volvo earlier this year, after Volvo said it would no longer financially back the company and would seek to sell its 48pc stake to other shareholders.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph earlier this year, Mr Ingenlath blamed drivers being “scared of change” for the slowdown in EV demand, and claimed that rivals slowing their electrification plans were falling into a “trap”.\n\nHe said: “I see far too many people hesitating with that and being scared of change. That is just not a good recipe for the future.”\n\nHe added that manufacturers pumping the breaks on EV rollout plans will be left at a disadvantage given the complexities of launching new vehicles.\n\n“There’s an incredible threat and danger if you don’t embrace future innovation and believe in that technology – the electric drivetrains, the innovation in battery, the innovation in modern electronics and software,” he said.

The chain has said it has never given money to Israel or its military that the perception of any connection is driven by misinformation online.\n\nIt comes after Starbucks unceremoniously parted ways with its chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, this month after a turgid year for the company which saw its sales slip. Brian Niccol, the former chief executive of Mexican chain Chipotle, was hired to replace him.\n\nStarbucks is not the only big consumer brand to face boycotts and protests over a perceived link with Israel.\n\nMcDonalds, too, became the focus of anger after photos and videos on social media emerged showing its stores in Israel giving meals to Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.\n\n09:40 AM BST\n\nEggs from housed birds to be labelled ‘free range’ as ministers slash farming red tape\n\nEggs laid by housed birds will be able to be labelled ‘free range’ in a move designed to slash the red tape faced by farmers.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said on Wednesday it would relax egg labeling rules so farmers can call eggs ‘free range’ even if birds have been housed for several months to protect them from avian influenza.\n\nIt comes as the UK has faced major outbreaks of the disease over recent years, which led to empty shelves at points.\n\nFarmers previously were forced to label free-range eggs as barn eggs if the birds were kept indoors for more than 16 weeks, leading to increased costs.\n\n09:34 AM BST\n\nMorrisons to slash prices on 2,000 products amid fightback against discounters\n\nMorrisons is to cut the price of more than 2,000 products as the supermarket battles to claw back market share from rivals.\n\nThe supermarket said on Wednesday it would lower the price of a large range of fridge, freezer and cupboard foods - although the discounts will only be offered to customers who use its ‘More’ loyalty cards.\n\nIt comes as Morrisons is battling to reclaim market share after it was overtaken by Aldi in 2022.

Consumers should be able to buy products which meet their needs and provide fair value.”\n\n07:36 AM BST\n\nHyundai to ramp up hybrid car production as EV demand slows\n\nCarmaker Hyundai has said it will double the amount of hybrid cars it makes, amid a slump in demand for ‘pure’ electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe company told investors on Wednesday it would increase the number of hybrid cars it makes to 14, expanding outside of compact and mid-sized cars into large and luxury vehicles.\n\nIt comes as demand for EVs has fallen, sparking a retreat from manufacturers such as Ford, Porsche and Mercedes, which have scaled back their ambitions over recent months.\n\nHyundai said it “aims to address the EV deceleration by expanding its hybrid and new EREV offerings and gradually increasing EV models by 2030 when a recovery in EV demand is expected”.\n\nThe company will also launch an extended-range EV that will use a small gasoline engine to keep an on-board battery charged, in a bid to combat so-called ‘range anxiety’ among buyers.

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Semiconductor Stock That Will Catch Up to Nvidia Within 10 Years",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have captivated Wall Street since the start of 2023. Advances in the chip market have allowed dozens of other industries to take their technologies to the next level. Sectors like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, virtual/augmented reality, consumer tech, self-driving cars, and more have all benefited from new chip designs from companies like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). As a result, semiconductor companies have become some of the best options for investing in tech.\n\nNvidia's and AMD's stocks have climbed 782% and 132% since the start of 2023, when a boom in AI kicked off. Nvidia managed to get a headstart in the industry and was able to immediately begin supplying its chips to AI developers worldwide. Meanwhile, AMD required more time to produce competitive hardware.\n\nHowever, AMD has made promising strides in AI in 2024 and could be on track to deliver significant gains in the coming years. It's one semiconductor stock that I predict will catch up to Nvidia's market cap of $3 trillion within 10 years.\n\nAMD is scaling up to better meet AI demand\n\nAMD stock has popped 12% since its second quarter of 2024 earnings were released on July 30, rallying investors with a win in AI that proves the market has become its biggest growth driver.\n\nTotal revenue increased 7% year over year to just under $6 billion, mainly fueled by a 115% spike in its AI-driven data center segment and a 49% increase in its client division. The quarter benefited from a ramp-up in AI graphics processing unit (GPU) and central processing unit (CPU) sales.\n\nOver the last year, AMD has gone full force into AI, expanding into multiple areas of the industry that will likely pay over the next decade. The company has unveiled its most powerful GPUs to date and announced plans to purchase server builder ZT systems for $5 billion. Both moves make the company more competitive against Nvidia, with the acquisition allowing AMD to more quickly roll out its AI GPUs at a scale necessary for cloud providers.\n\nAMD's chips have already attracted some of AI's biggest players, with the company signing on Microsoft's Azure, Meta Platforms, and Oracle as clients. These cloud giants are in steep competition with each other, requiring powerful hardware to stay competitive. As a result, AI chip demand is only likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, with AMD well-positioned to enjoy major gains.\n\nAI opportunities outside of GPUs\n\nIn addition to GPUs, AMD is planting seeds throughout the AI market to diversify its positions and profit from growth catalysts far into the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company has a massive opportunity in AI central processing units. CPUs have been AMD's specialty for years, with its CPU market share rising from 18% in 2017 to 34% this year, as it has consistently taken market share from Intel. Meanwhile, data from Verified Market Reports shows that the AI CPU sector was valued at $15 billion last year and is projected to hit $410 billion by the end of the decade, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%.\n\nExpertise in CPUs also grants AMD a potentially lucrative role in the quickly expanding AI-capable PC market. As demand for AI services has risen, so has the need for more powerful hardware. As a result, AI-enabled PCs are projected to make up about 40% of all global PC shipments in 2025, with the market developing at a CAGR of 44% through 2028.\n\nNvidia's market cap was $359 billion at the start of 2023. Yet, it hit $3 trillion in June 2024, just 18 months later, after a rally that boosted its stock by 738%. The company's success was primarily fueled by a massive spike in its AI GPU sales. Nvidia has shown what is possible with success in one facet of AI. Meanwhile, AMD has laid the foundation in multiple areas of the industry that could deliver significant stock gains.\n\nAMD's market cap is currently about $251 billion. The company's stock would need to rise 1,200% to hit $3 trillion over the next 10 years. It's a lofty target, but not an unreachable one. Since AMD's stock is up more than 3,000% since 2014, it might not be too far a reach. AMD EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThe chart above projects AMD's earnings to hit just over $7 per share by fiscal 2026. Multiplying this figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 yields a share price of $336, projecting potential stock growth near 115% by 2026.\n\nYet, Nvidia's spectacular rise in AI and AMD's performance over the last 10 years suggest that growth could be conservative. As a result, AMD could be on a growth path to achieve that coveted $3 trillion market cap over the next decade. The company is expanding quickly, and you won't want to miss out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first non-technology company in the U.S. to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate's stock has surged over 30% in 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This impressive feat comes just days before Buffett, often referred to as the 'Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha,' celebrates his 94th birthday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Berkshire's shares climbed to an all-time high, pushing the company's market value past the $1 trillion mark.\n\nUnlike the other members of the trillion-dollar club—Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta—Berkshire Hathaway is distinguished by its focus on traditional industries.\n\nThe company owns a diverse array of businesses. However, Berkshire's significant investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also been a significant contributor to its recent growth.\n\nBuffett took control of Berkshire in the 1960s and has since transformed it into a vast empire with interests in insurance, railroads, retail, and energy. The company is renowned for its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves.\n\nRecently, Buffett has adopted a more cautious approach, selling off a large amount of stock—including half of Berkshire's Apple holdings—and amassing a record $277 billion in cash by the end of June.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that over the past few days, Berkshire has sold more shares of Bank of America as the company continues to trim its stake in the U.S. lender.\n\nAccording to regulatory filings, Berkshire has sold around $5.4 billion worth of Bank of America shares sales since mid-July. According to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, between August 23 and 27, the company is said to have sold roughly 24.7 million shares of the lender.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire joins the $1 trillion club\n\nPoland stocks lower at close of trade; WIG30 down 0.58%\n\nUS SEC requires monthly reports on investment fund holdings\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Top Nvidia Analyst Sees No Major Impact From Blackwell Delay, But Flags One Caveat He's Wary About Ahead Of Earnings\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWall Street's much-awaited earnings report is almost upon us, and artificial intelligence stalwart Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is widely expected to clear the lofty goals. Ahead of the results, an analyst at Morgan Stanley said he is comfortable with the \"high expectations.\"\n\nThe Nvidia Analyst:\n\nJoseph Moore has an Overweight rating and a $144 price target for Nvidia shares.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThe Nvidia Thesis:\n\nNvidia stock has fairly weathered concerns surrounding potential delays in Blackwell shipments, said Moore in a note released late Sunday. Near-term business is strong and Blackwell ramp-up will likely happen this year as per initial guidance, he said.\n\nMoore expects some volume in October and a more material ramp-up in the January quarter. The management is likely to stick to its script and say \"they are on track to volume\" and potentially not even acknowledge tactical setbacks, he said.\n\nWhy Blackwell Delay Shouldn't Matter\n\nThe shift in the timing of Blackwell shipment doesn't matter very much, as supply and customer demand have rapidly pivoted to H200, the analyst said. \"Customer enthusiasm for Blackwell is at very high levels, but the utility of a small volume of Blackwell in the initial ramp phase is somewhat lower,\" he said.\n\nMoore said it will take time for Blackwell's demand from cloud businesses to pick up, adding that Hopper is seeing exceptionally strong demand from this end market. At least some hyper scalers may prefer to get more Hoppers as they will need high-volume clusters of Blackwell to get relevant outcomes, he said.\n\nH20 – Margin Dampener?\n\nThe H20 ramp-up, Moore said, is also a meaningful contributor. H20 is the China-specific AI accelerator of Nvidia that helps the company to sidestep the U.S. ban on China chip exports. Citing checks in Asia, the analyst said H20 builds have increased to about 1.2 million units for the year, at an average selling price of $13-15k.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccordingly, the H20 could fetch more than $10 billion in revenue over the next three quarters, Moore said. The analyst also said fears of margin compression due to the low-cost H20s are getting blown out of proportion. \"If H200 has 80% gross margins at $22k, that would imply cost of sales of about $4400; if H20 has 20% lower costs, or about $3600, then the average selling price of $14k would still drive about 74% gross margin, much higher than some of the bear cases,\" he added.\n\nRead More:\n\nDiscover the compelling reasons behind the staggering $110.5 million price tag of this painting and explore the world of high-value art investments.

The analyst said for the stock to remain unchanged, the company has to guide in the $33 billion to $34 billion range for the fiscal third quarter.\n\n\"We are generally comfortable with high expectations and expect visibility to improve as new products ramp,\" he added.\n\nQ2 Expectation\n\nHere's a compilation of Morgan Stanley's estimates for the second and third quarters and fiscal year 2025 versus the consensus:\n\nQ2'25 Q3'25 FY25 Revenue $28.17B $30.22B $152.65B Gross margin 75.6% 75.7% 75.1% EPS 63 cents 68 cents $3.53\n\nLock In High Rates Now With A Short-Term Commitment\n\nLeaving your cash where it is earning nothing is like wasting money.

        "title": "Fundstrat’s Tom Lee: NVIDIA (NVDA) Is Among World’s ‘Most Important’ Companies",
        "content": "We recently published a list of  Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang’s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it’s going to be a “difficult week” for major tech companies.\n\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\n“I still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,” Munster said.\n\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\n“There is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it’s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.”\n\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nFundstrat’s Tom Lee recently said in an interview with CNBC that despite the latest declines tech is “still in a good place because of AI” and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) position should “reinforce that.”\n\nHe also thinks Nvidia’s multiple is attractive.\n\n“NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is maybe 28 times forward earnings, which, for one of the most important companies in the world, it’s not a high multiple. So if tech is in a good place, and then we get Fed cuts, I think it allows the overall market to expand,” Lee said.\n\nAnalysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,” analysts said.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia’s Hopper chips is strong.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "These 3 Stocks Are Beating Nvidia This Year. Are They Better Buys Than the AI Leader?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the star of the stock market this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip specialist has wowed investors with triple-digit revenue growth and an even faster surge on the bottom line as it drives the generative AI revolution forward.\n\nNo other stock in history has added trillions of dollars in market value so fast, and Nvidia even briefly became the most valuable company in the world, topping Apple and Microsoft. Year to date, Nvidia stock has surged 160% -- certainly, an impressive run.\n\nYet, some stocks have actually beaten the tech powerhouse this year. Keep reading below to see three of them, and whether they can continue to outperform Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Cava Group\n\nCava Group (NYSE: CAVA) is one of the most impressive restaurant stocks to emerge on the market in years, arguably since Chipotle Mexican Grill. The founder of Panera Bread, Ron Shaich, was an early investor and serves as chair of the board, helping to steer the fast-casual chain toward success.\n\nCava has also adopted a Chipotle-like menu but with Mediterranean food and a similar minimalist industrial store design. The concept is clearly resonating with customers, according to its results. In the second quarter, Cava reported comparable sales growth of 14.4%, driven by a 9.5% jump in traffic, showing that the concept is catching on.\n\nIts average unit volumes, meaning the average annual revenue per restaurant, improved to $2.7 billion, approaching Chipotle's at $3.1 billion. Cava's restaurant-level profit margin is similarly impressive at 26.5% in the most recent quarter, which compares to 28.9% at Chipotle.\n\nCava's bottom-line profits are also jumping as net income tripled in the second quarter to $19.7 million. The chain is still small at 341 locations, which should give it a long runway of growth. After the earnings pop last Friday, Cava stock is now 182% this year.\n\n2. Sweetgreen\n\nAnother restaurant chain, Sweetgreen (NYSE: SG), has also been a breakout performer this year as the fast-casual salad chain has surged thanks to strong growth numbers and a low share price at the beginning of the year.\n\nSweetgreen has taken a more circuitous route to its current level than Cava as the stock went public at the peak of the pandemic bubble and then crashed, along with nearly every other growth stock.\n\nSince then, the salad slinger has reassured investors of its potential, delivering both impressive growth and improving restaurant-level profits. It's also introduced a robotic kitchen assistant it calls Infinite Kitchen, which the company says is accelerating throughput and saving on labor costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue at Sweetgreen jumped 21% to $184.6 million in the second quarter, driven by same-store sales growth of 9%. Sweetgreen's average unit volume is at $2.9 billion, similar to Chipotle, and its restaurant-level profit margin improved from 20% to 22%.\n\nThe company is the leader in the fast-casual salad space, and it also has a lot of room for growth with just around 225 locations currently. Its Infinite Kitchen technology -- an automated system for preparing food -- adds another way for the company to differentiate itself.\n\nSo far this year, Sweetgreen stock has jumped 225%.\n\n3. Carvana\n\nCarvana (NYSE: CVNA) has been one of the biggest surprises in the stock market in recent years. The online used-car dealer was left for dead in 2022 as its once-rapid growth came to a halt and the business was on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, through aggressive cost-cutting and stabilization in the used-car market, Carvana has rebounded, and the stock has continued to surge this year, up 194% year to date.\n\nBy sharply reducing its inventory and restructuring its debt, Carvana has been able to deliver positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income.\n\nCarvana has also returned to unit sales growth and solid revenue growth with sales up 23% in the second quarter.\n\nThe online used-car dealer should also benefit from lower interest rates. They would encourage more demand from car buyers and make it easier for Carvana to refinance its debt and lower its interest expense, which is still a significant cost for the company at more than half of its operating income.\n\nAre Cava, Sweetgreen, and Carvana buys?\n\nAll three of these stocks have earned their soaring performances this year with Sweetgreen and Carvana falling more into the turnaround category than Cava.\n\nOf the three of them, Cava looks like the most attractive right now as its execution and results have been nearly perfect since its initial public offering and it seems well-positioned to follow the growth path in the fast-casual sector carved out by Chipotle.\n\nCarvana, on the other hand, seems like the riskiest of the stocks as it still carries a substantial debt load and the cyclicality of the used car market can be brutal, though falling interest rates should be a tailwind for the company.\n\nFinally, Sweetgreen is another attractive growth story as a unique concept in the restaurant industry, and Infinite Kitchen could prove to be a key driver of profitability as the company adds it to more locations.\n\nFor investors comparing these stocks to Nvidia, it's important to understand that Nvidia's upside potential is likely rather limited at this point. With Nvidia's market capitalization at more than $3 trillion, even for it to gain 50% from here would mean a market value of greater than $4.5 trillion, and no company has ever reached $4 trillion in market value.\n\nThat doesn't mean that it can't be done, but if you're looking for the next five-bagger or 10-bagger stock, you're better off shifting your focus away from Nvidia to a smaller growth stock like Cava, Sweetgreen, or Carvana.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cava Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cava Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cava Group wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks has picked up steam in the past couple of years. Companies across industries are increasingly opting for advanced AI technologies to generate cost efficiencies and improve productivity and decision-making. Subsequently, many of these companies expect to see an increase in topline revenues and bottom-line earnings in the coming years.\n\nStill, stock investors should be cautious about the euphoria surrounding the AI industry. If they want to benefit materially from this secular trend, they should focus on AI-powered companies with sustainable competitive advantages and robust financials. Two such companies are Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nHere's why market analysts expect these companies to prove exceptional AI stock picks in the long run.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices: Forecasted upside potential of 76%\n\nChip designer Advanced Micro Devices reported impressive second-quarter data, with revenue and profits topping consensus analyst estimates. The analysts were also pleased with the third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance and the increased full-year revenue outlook for its data center AI chips segment. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes set a very bullish $265 target price for AMD stock. The target implies an upside potential of 76% over the next year or so.\n\nNvidia is the undisputed leader in the data center AI market. AMD is working hard to capture a significant share of this high-margin market with its competitively priced and rapidly expanding AI chip portfolio. The company incorporated high-bandwidth memory capacity in its new Instinct MI300 GPUs, making them well-suited for AI inferencing workloads. AMD reported quarterly MI300 sales that topped $1 billion for the first time in the second quarter. AMD also significantly improved its ROCm software stack to support its hardware, making it easier for clients to train AI models on its platform.\n\nAMD is also gearing up to launch new AI accelerators with higher memory capacity and compute performance such as the MI325X series later in 2024, the MI350 series in 2025, and the MI400 series in 2026. The recent $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT System, a major AI infrastructure provider for hyperscalers, is expected to strengthen the company's foray into the rapidly expanding AI market. The company also acquired Silo AI, the largest private AI lab in Europe, to get access to top-notch human talent in the AI industry.\n\nElsewhere, AMD already enjoys a strong presence in the global CPU market. The company is already seeing robust adoption of its fourth-generation EPYC server CPUs from cloud providers and large enterprises. The company also plans to launch fifth-generation EPYC processors in the second half of 2024 AMD accounted for 24.1% unit share and 33.7% of the revenue share of the data center CPU market in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD's gross margins were 53% in the second quarter, up 340 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The company expects its margins to continue to grow in the coming quarters, in tandem with its increasing share in the AI market.\n\nAMD stock trades at 10.9 times trailing 12-month sales, higher than its five-year average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.2. However, considering its rapidly expanding presence in the data center and server CPU markets and improving margins, the premium valuation seems justified. The stock may thus prove to be an attractive pick even at current elevated price levels.\n\nNvidia: Forecasted upside potential of 95%\n\nA darling of the stock market, semiconductor giant Nvidia's shares have gained 159% so far in 2024. Yet, according to hedge fund manager Eric Jackson of EMJ Capital, the stock can hit $250 per share by the end of 2024, implying an upside potential of 95%. Jackson bases his claims on the fact that (until very recently) Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was lower than its average forward P/E over the past five years. Over the past five years, Nvidia's forward P/E topped 50 three times and hovered around 70 two times. Given Nvidia's forecasted growth potential in 2025 and 2026, investor euphoria is likely to drive valuation levels closer to these peak levels in the coming months.\n\nAlthough Jackson's forecast may seem overtly bullish, investor optimism for the company is well justified. Nvidia accounted for 92% of the U.S. data center GPU market in early 2024 and 65% of the global data-center AI chips market in 2023. The company's full-stack platform approach, which includes a complete ecosystem of AI-optimized hardware chips and software systems, networking solutions, and development frameworks, is strengthening and expanding its reach in AI and high-performance computing markets. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with technology titans such as Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Microsoft are also playing a critical role in driving demand for the company's advanced chips and networking components in areas such as data centers, healthcare, social media, and autonomous driving.\n\nNvidia enjoys significant pricing power for its AI chips, enabling the company to report impressive gross margins. The company's flagship H100 chip currently sells for $25,000 per unit. Nvidia can also charge higher pricing for its next-generation H200 and Blackwell architecture chips, thanks to superior technological capabilities and the ongoing supply crunch. Hence, the company's profit margins can stay high in the coming quarters.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it may prove a smart move to pick up at least a small stake in Nvidia stock now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From NVIDIA Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report",
        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From NVIDIA Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is set to release earnings results for its second quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts expect the Santa Clara, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at 64 cents per share, up sharply from 25 cents per share in the year-ago period. NVIDIA projects to report quarterly revenue of $28.68 billion for the quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nOn Tuesday, Truist Securities analyst William Stein maintained NVIDIA with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $140 to $145.\n\nWith the recent buzz around NVIDIA, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, NVIDIA offers an annual dividend yield of 0.03%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 1 cent per share (4 cents a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $19,245,000 or around 150,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $3,849,000 or around 30,000 shares.\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($0.04 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.04 = 150,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.04 = 30,000 shares ($100 per month).\n\nView more earnings on NVDA\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nNVDA Price Action: Shares of Nvidia gained 1.5% to close at $128.30 on Tuesday.\n\nRead More:\n\nMicrosoft, Synaptics And 2 Other Stocks Executives Are Selling\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From NVIDIA Stock Ahead Of Q2 Earnings Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the 3 Largest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Companies by 2035",
        "content": "A lot can happen in 11 years. Think back to 2013. That was the year that Frozen debuted in theaters, Barack Obama began his second term as president, and Twitter debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSo, looking ahead to 2035, which artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will be the three largest in the world? Here are my predictions. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nAlthough it is often the world's second-largest company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) should grow even larger over the next 11 years thanks to its numerous AI initiatives.\n\nTo start with, its cloud services segment, Microsoft Azure, should benefit immensely from the AI revolution. Azure, already the world's second-largest cloud services business, is well positioned to capture additional revenue as organizations ramp up their cloud and AI spending. The unit's machine learning tools and prebuilt AI models should attract even more revenue for its Intelligent Cloud segment, which already generates more than $100 billion in revenue annually.\n\nWhat's more, the next decade should see Microsoft integrate even more AI-powered features into its iconic software suite. Copilot AI integrations have already kicked off, and as AI tools continue to improve, the company should be able to extract even more revenue from its software suite and the AI add-ons that are incorporated into it.\n\nIn summary, Microsoft's diverse business segments should reap many benefits from the AI revolution over the next 11 years. That, in turn, will keep it firmly within the list of top 3 AI stocks by market cap.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Microsoft, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) operates one of the world's premier cloud services businesses, Amazon Web Services (AWS). And just like its foremost rival, AWS already generates more than $100 billion in annual revenue.\n\nYet, that figure will surely rise over the next 11 years due to the AI revolution. AWS offers a broad range of AI-powered services. Developers and organizations can use these tools to build, train, and deploy AI models.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon will use AI to power its other core business: e-commerce. The company already utilizes AI to power its massive logistics network. AI helps the company predict purchasing patterns, proactively stock its fulfillment centers, and determine the fastest and cheapest routes for shipping. On top of that, Amazon already uses close to 1 million robots within its facilities. That figure should skyrocket in the coming years, particularly as its robots become more effective and as labor costs continue to rise.\n\nWith a current market cap of $1.9 trillion, Amazon has some work to do to catch Apple, which currently has a market cap of $3.4 trillion. Yet, as noted above, 11 years is a long time, and I believe that Amazon can leapfrog the iPhone maker by 2035.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nFinally, there's Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It should come as no surprise that the king of graphic processing units (GPUs) makes the cut.\n\nFirst of all, Nvidia's dominance of the GPU marketplace will be the main reason the company maintains its spot as one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its chips are sought after by developers for their speed and ease of use -- and that's unlikely to change anytime soon. In addition, AI developers are comfortable working with the company's CUDA parallel computing platform. That creates a barrier to entry for Nvidia's competitors, as developers may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with their offerings.\n\nHowever, Nvidia will excel over the long term for other reasons, too. Assuming autonomous driving capabilities improve and demand for them takes off, Nvidia could benefit. Furthermore, innovative gaming developments could bolster demand for its GPUs in the video game space, as could renewed interest in virtual reality simulations or the metaverse.\n\nAll in all, Nvidia remains a solid choice to be the top AI company for a reason -- its hardware is the go-to choice for developers working on the cutting edge of innovation. No one knows how the next 11 years will unfold, but it's easy to see that Nvidia is as well positioned for them as any company today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Earnings Will Test the S&amp;P 500’s $4 Trillion Recovery",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The almost $3 trillion rally in Nvidia Corp. shares over the roughly two years since ChatGPT’s unveiling has virtually rewired the US stock market, giving the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant an outsized influence on a bevy of equity indexes.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City\n\nWall Street witnessed that sway during the equities rout earlier this month and the subsequent rebound, in which the S&P 500 Index recovered $4 trillion in market capitalization between Aug. 5 and Aug. 23 as Nvidia’s stock price soared more than 28% in just three weeks. Now, with the company’s earnings scheduled to arrive after the market close Wednesday, traders will be glued to their monitors in preparation for any wild swings.\n\nGoing by the options market, Nvidia’s results are expected to send its shares careening nearly 10% in either direction — a move that would shuffle some $300 billion in market cap. And that’s just its own stock. The chipmaker accounts for 6.7% of the S&P 500, making it the second biggest company in the broad equities benchmark after Apple Inc. It also has a more than 8% weighting in the Nasdaq 100, and it makes up 14% of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\n“Nvidia is obviously the cleanest sort of pure play way for investors to assess the health of the AI infrastructure space,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “So Nvidia’s earnings are watched because they have direct read-throughs for so many companies in the AI value chain.”\n\nSeeking Revenue Growth\n\nSales growth will be the focus on Nvidia’s results after earlier reports from AI darlings like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. showed huge capital outlays producing relatively puny bumps in revenues. For five quarters now, the chipmaker has far outstripped expectations and promised even bigger hauls to come. It has done this by becoming the primary beneficiary of billions in AI spending, so any deviation from that trend would raise questions about the technology’s promise.\n\nThat pivotal role has effectively transformed the once obscure semiconductor manufacturer into a key measure of US economic strength.\n\n“It shouldn’t be a bellwether for the economy,” said Shana Sissel, founder and president at Banríon Capital Management. “But it has become one because of the size and the impact of the stock on the overall market.”\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s quarterly revenue to be around $29 billion, more than double what it reported a year ago. And they anticipate another boost in guidance for future sales. But there is one new wrinkle — the company has to give an update on its next-generation Blackwell chip amid reports of delays and design flaws. The company said in early August that production is on track to ramp in the second half of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Concerns about the Blackwell chip delay could weigh on the upside to expectations for fiscal 2025, making management’s comments — especially a reassuring 2025 outlook — critical,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts led by Kunjan Sobhani wrote in an Aug. 21 note.\n\nParsing Commentary\n\nAny commentary about Blackwell on the call is going to be dissected like a Federal Reserve announcement, according to Howard Chan, chief executive officer at Kurv Investment Management.\n\n“Everybody’s going to be mulling over every single word,” he said.\n\nAnalysts and investors will also be watching for signs that another Nvidia chip, the H-200, is seeing demand that could offset pushing out revenue from Blackwell. If Nvidia delivers solid results with its current slate of chips, it likely bodes well for the next-generation product.\n\n“It’s probably a good sign if they put up really good numbers here and those are due to strong demand for H-200,” Gabelli’s Belton said. “That probably paints an encouraging picture for incremental demand for Blackwell into next year.”\n\nOf course, Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on shares of Nvidia. The stock has 66 buy ratings, 8 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its 12-month price target of around $145 implies a gain of roughly 13% from where they currently trade. Nvidia’s valuation has also compressed, with the shares trading at a blended forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 38 times, down from 44 times in June and north of 60 times last year. The S&P 500 trades at roughly 21 times its forward earnings.\n\nConcerns about how long heavy spending on AI will continue and worries around the Blackwell chip weighed on the shares in the early August trough. But the rally since shows that investors are still willing to buy dips in the stock as Big Tech’s AI mania shows few signs of stopping — yet.\n\n“The bar has been raised, I think, in the last few quarters,” Belton said. “If you think about what happened with all the megacap stocks throughout this earnings cycle, I think the market definitely wants to see a healthy beat and forward quarter guidance above published estimates. I think this recent run up for near-term trading really matters.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nChipmaker Nvidia was up 0.5% in pre-market trade, as investors awaited the release of its highly anticipated earnings after the US bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks, serving as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.\n\nNvidia is expected to report revenues of $28.7bn for the second quarter, representing a 113% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets up as traders turn to Nvidia results\n\nRevenues for its data center business are expected to jump 142% to $24bn. Gaming revenues of $2.7bn are also expected.\n\nSemiconductor stocks lost ground on Tuesday alongside a 1% drop for the AI darling, a sign of how Nvidia's report could ripple through tech stocks as it tests the AI trade that has driven gains.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD)\n\nShares in CrowdStrike were just above the flatline in pre-market trading as the cybersecurity firm prepares to reveal its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, with investors eager to see how the company behind the recent global outage is performing.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm has seen its market value sharply decline after its involvement in a Microsoft-related (MSFT) IT disruption that caused widespread chaos. The incident, attributed to “a single content update for Windows hosts”, led to severe disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, emergency services and media outlets globally.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"We worry new customer additions are going to see an impact. Executives may want to get 'into the weeds' on why CrowdStrike is the right answer and why their choice is not inviting a future outage,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\n\nThe cloud-based security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.4%, according to Zachs Research. Revenues are expected to be $958.66m, up 31% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nShares of the company have declined about 20% since the outage, wiping about $20bn from its market value.\n\nNordstrom (JWN)\n\nShares in the department store chain were 7% higher in pre-market trading as its second quarter results beat estimates on the top and bottom line.\n\nThe Seattle-based company said it had net income of 72 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 96 cents per share.\n\nThe results came in well above Wall Street expectations, with the consensus being earnings of 74 cents per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal revenue at the company rose 3.2% to $3.89bn in the quarter ended 3 August, from $3.77bn a year earlier.\n\nDespite the earnings beat, Nordstrom provided cautious full-year guidance, expecting adjusted EPS between $1.75 and $2.05 and sales ranging from a 1% decline to 1% growth.\n\nPrudential (PRU.L)\n\nDespite a dip in new business profit in the first half of the year, insurer Prudential said it was confident about meeting targets going forward, with shares up nearly 2% in morning trading.\n\nIn results released on Wednesday, Prudential posted a 1% fall in new business profits to $1.4bn for the first six months of the year on an annual equivalent rate basis.\n\nHowever, it reported a 6% increase in adjusted operating profits to $1.5bn in the first half compared to the same period last year.\n\nA fall in annualised premium equivalent (APE) sales, a measure of new business written in insurance, drove a 3% decline in new business profits in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, an 18% fall in APE sales in China resulted in a 33% decrease in new business profits in China.\n\nHowever, Prudential reported a pick up in sale momentum in June, which it saw continuing into the second half of the year.\n\nThe company still expected new business profits for 2024 to grow at an annual rate consistent with the level needed to meet its 2022 to 2027 growth target.\n\nRead more: Average UK house price £3,600 higher since the beginning of 2024\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said that the reason for the dip in new business profits was “mainly due to extremely strong comparatives, given that this time last year China released its pandemic restrictions and opened its economy once more”.\n\nHunter added that geopolitical tensions, alongside “economic clouds which have hung over China in particular more recently have had a detrimental effect on the share price for Prudential, if not for its long-term prospects”.\n\nOver the last three years, shares were down 57%, which he said served as “a painful reminder of the ground which needs to be recovered”.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat-to-slightly higher on Wednesday, as investors held back ahead of a crucial quarterly earnings report from AI-favorite Nvidia to gauge if the market can withstand further risk-taking in a bull rally.\n\nWall Street's main indexes have broadly swung between small gains and losses since the start of the week, with the Dow hovering near record highs and the S&P 500 within 1% of a record high, as investors await the chip giant's results, due after markets close.\n\nShares of the No. 2 most valuable company in terms of market capitalization were up 0.4% in trading before the bell. However, data from ORATS showed options traders anticipate a nearly 10% jump in its shares if it reports a doubling in second-quarter revenue as expected.\n\nNvidia's stock is up nearly 160% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the benchmark index's 18% gain. Any disappointment in its results could hurt megacaps and other semiconductor stocks, which have led 2024's rally on the prospect of artificial intelligence integration boosting corporate profits.\n\nOther chip stocks such as Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices inched up, as did megacaps including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\n\"Markets put in a subdued performance yesterday... that should soon change from today, as we've got Nvidia's earnings... which have become an important macro event in their own right over recent quarters, with reactions that rival the sort of moves taking place after surprise jobs reports or (Consumer Price Index) releases,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said.\n\nAt 05:19 a.m., Dow E-minis were down 7 points, or 0.02%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 4 points, or 0.07% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 26.25 points, or 0.13%\n\nOn the macro front, sentiment favors the likelihood of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates at its September meeting. Odds of a 25-basis-point reduction stand at 63.5%, while those of a 50-bps cut are at 36.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell's support for imminent policy adjustment sparked broad-based market gains in the previous week. The Personal Consumption Expenditure report for July, due on Friday, is expected to provide insight into the pace and magnitude of the central bank's rate-cut trajectory.\n\nComments on the economic outlook from voting member and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, due later in the day, will be closely watched.\n\nInvestors also await earnings reports from J M Smucker, Abercrombie & Fitch and Bath & Body Works before markets open.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentinelOne raised its annual revenue forecast, sending shares of the cybersecurity company up by 1.9%, while Nordstrom jumped 7.8% after the department-store chain reported second-quarter profit which topped estimates.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Morning Bid: As Nvidia awaited, Treasuries absorb new deluge",
        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nNvidia's post-bell earnings update on Wednesday is keeping stock markets everywhere in a holding pattern, while U.S. Treasury markets appear to be absorbing the latest torrent of debt sales quite comfortably.\n\nThe wait for the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker's earnings has sucked all the oxygen out of the early part of the week, so large now is the influence of the $3.1 trillion-valued firm on wider stock indexes.\n\nEquity options traders are expecting Nvidia's report to spark a more than $300 billion swing in its shares over the day ahead. Pricing anticipates a stock move of almost 10% on Thursday - larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years.\n\nThe stock gained more than 1% on Tuesday and was marginally higher in out of hours trading early on Wednesday. S&P500 and Nasdaq futures held steady.\n\nThe stakes are higher than ever, given the recent creeping doubts about AI overspend and the lack of end product so far for the new tech. Apple's planned announcement on Sept. 9 of a new iPhone with new AI functionality, however, may ease some of those concerns.\n\nAnd it's a big earnings day more broadly for Big Tech - with Salesforce also reporting and CrowdStrike updating following a July flub that sparked a worldwide computer outage.\n\nBut while the S&P500 has stopped short of new record highs awaiting the Nvidia results, the market remains buoyant with the Federal Reserve now finally set to cut interest rates in three weeks' time.\n\nNowhere has that been clearer than in the ease with which Treasury sold another $69 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday. Demand was stronger than forecast and, at 3.86% early on Wednesday, 2-year yields are eyeing 15-month lows.\n\nAnother $70 billion of 5-year paper hits the street later today, with the total of bills and coupons up for grabs this week alone surpassing half a trillion dollars.\n\nTreasury is frontloading the new debt in short maturities and almost three quarters of that huge total this week is in bills with tenors of less than 12 months - a move that will see some benefit to debt servicing costs as Fed rates tumble.\n\nBut the good reception for the new two-year notes and with one eye on how all those bills eventually get refinanced over the years ahead, the inverted yield curve between two and 10 years narrowed to just 3 basis points - its smallest in three weeks.\n\nThe latest U.S. economic releases provide little bar to those souped-up easing expectations - now running at as much as 104 basis points over the remainder of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August, Americans are becoming more anxious about the labor market - the cooling of which is now front and center of the Fed's focus.\n\nAnd despite multiple supply anxieties from the Middle East to Libya, oil prices were on the wane again on Wednesday - and still clocking year-on-year losses of more than 5%.\n\nThe dollar was pretty mixed on all that. Its DXY index was a touch higher as the euro retreated following some soft euro zone lending data and expectations that the European Central Bank will now cut for the second time next month before the Fed even gets going.\n\nDollar/yen was a touch firmer despite relatively hawkish Bank of Japan comments. BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino restated the central bank's intention to continue lifting interest rates if inflation stayed on course, while closely monitoring financial market conditions.\n\nIn politics, the latest national opinion polls continue to show Vice President Kamala Harris marginally ahead of challenger Donald Trump and she remains favorite to win at bookmakers - with the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showing her also ahead on her economic policy stance.\n\nHarris and running mate Tim Walz are expected to interview with CNN TV on Thursday.\n\nTrump, meantime, faced a revised federal indictment on Tuesday accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, with prosecutors narrowing their approach after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution.\n\nIn Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned on Tuesday of a 'painful' budget ahead and travelled to Berlin on Wednesday to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nSterling has been buoyed since before Labour's recent election win in part on expectations the new government will ease relations with former European Union partners and seek to soften some of the economically-damaging post-Brexit agreement.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller in India and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks\n\n* US corporate earnings: Nvidia, Salesforce, CrowdStrike, HP, NetApp, JM Smucker, Cooper Companies, Bath & Body Works\n\n* US Treasury sells $70 billion of 5-year notes, sells two-year FRNs\n\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia",
        "content": "After propelling markets to record highs in the first half of 2024, the mega cap tech companies that have dominated Wall Street are now grappling with the aftermath of a global selloff that has wiped nearly $1tn (£755bn) off their combined market value.\n\nThe so-called “Magnificent Seven” — a term inspired by the classic Western film and popularised on Wall Street — includes tech behemoths Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). These companies were instrumental in driving the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains last year, with a Morgan Stanley report highlighting that these seven companies alone accounted for half of the index's total return.\n\nThe combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven exceeds that of the entire stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China, and Canada combined. However, this group has recently encountered significant setbacks. Six of the seven companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, and the results have fallen short of the lofty expectations set by investors.\n\nTesla, for instance, saw its earnings plummet by more than 40%, despite surpassing sales forecasts. Amazon’s share price plunged 11% following its earnings announcement. Growing concerns about the health of the US economy also fuelled a wave of selling across global markets.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\n\"Coming into this earnings season, the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were up against almost impossible expectations of beating perfection,\" Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBiz Investment Advisory Services, said. \"So in some ways, it's not surprising to see some sell-off here.\"\n\nThere are also cases where the Mag 7 are just too expensive. Nvidia's valuation surged to such heights that it became out of reach for many value investors. Back in July the company decided to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split, when it was trading at around $1,210, to make its stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. It is now trading at around $120 as the countdown continues to its earnings.\n\nThe $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks when it reports later on Wednesday, serving as a bellwether for AI spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.\n\nAs the AI rally enters a crucial stage, investors are left to consider where to look for alternatives to diversify their portfolio or undervalued stocks that might benefit from artificial intelligence. Here are some companies to have on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nFive alternatives to the Magnificent Seven ASML makes lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nThe AI rally has been driven by the need for the world’s most advanced chips. Dutch company ASML manufactures lithography machines essential for producing them.\n\nWhile not a household name, ASML should be on any investor’s radar who is looking to capitalise on the growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nASML is virtually the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. Its clients include semiconductor giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (005930.KS).\n\nWhen ASML published its quarterly results in July, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “ASML is further proof that the AI boom still has legs. Demand is soaring for the semiconductor equipment maker.”\n\nDespite a recent share price pullback, the current price of around $920 is more than 20% below analysts' consensus target of $1,194, and the vast majority of analysts still consider the stock a strong buy.\n\n“Companies across countless industries are investing heavily in AI, which means chipmakers have the confidence to build more manufacturing plants,” Coatsworth added. “That feeds into greater demand for ASML’s equipment, which plays a crucial role in the production of computer chips.”\n\nHowever, weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance has negatively impacted the stock. Nearly half of ASML’s sales still come from China, making geopolitical risk a significant concern for investors.\n\nRead more: How likely are multiple Bank of England interest rate cuts this year?\n\nASML is also part of the \"Granolas\" — a group of \"internationally-exposed quality growth compounders\" and Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven, according to Goldman Sachs. So named for the combined first initials, which spell Grannnllass, the eleven companies are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche (ROG.SW), ASML, Nestle (NESN.SW), Novartis (NOVN.SW), Novo Nordisk (NVO), L'Oreal (OR.PA), LVMH (MC.PA), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), SAP (SAP) and Sanofi (SNY).\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) The weight loss drug has proven to be a success with celebrities. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNovo Nordisk, another member of the Granolas, is currently Europe’s largest company by market capitalisation and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, is not exposed to the tech sector. This could be an attractive option for those who believe that AI is a bubble or simply want diversification.\n\nThe Danish firm makes the weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, which have gained widespread popularity, including among celebrities such as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and TV personality Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSam North, market analyst at eToro, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"Novo Nordisk emerges as a standout option in Europe. The Danish pharmaceutical giant has gone from strength to strength over the last few years and is currently the largest stock in Europe by market capitalisation.\n\n“Analysts are optimistic about Novo Nordisk's performance, particularly with its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. The company reportedly sold 10.4bn Danish kroner (£1.2bn) worth of Wegovy in the first quarter alone, more than doubling its sales from the same period last year.\"\n\nHe added: “From a technical analysis standpoint, there are a couple of levels that I think act as a good guide of sentiment for the bulls to focus on. The 740 DKK level offers a potential entry point for those looking to buy on dips, while a move above 928 DKK could signal a push towards its previous all-time high. In an environment where timing the market is challenging, Novo Nordisk stands out as a resilient and promising addition to any portfolio.”\n\nNovo Nordisk’s shares have surged around 260% since launching Wegovy in the United States in June 2021. The company’s market value of £455bn now exceeds the size of the entire Danish economy.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) The group that owns the Louis Vuitton brand has show resilience in the consumer discretionary segment.. (Pablo Cuadra via Getty Images)\n\nThough LVMH has lost its crown as Europe’s largest company to Novo Nordisk, it remains a heavyweight contender.\n\nDespite challenges in the consumer discretionary sector, LVMH has continued to deliver strong profits, with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels. This translated into €10.7bn (£9.02bn/$12bn) in operating profit. Additionally, its free cash flow increased by 74% to €3.13bn, or 7.5% of revenue.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on slowing growth and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22:2.\n\nLVMH's diversified conglomerate model, which includes brands like Tiffany, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora, allows it to tap into different luxury segments.\n\nGrowth is also likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall globally.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)  Snowflake chairman and CEO Frank Slootman gifts a snowboard to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nReturning to the US and the tech sector, Snowflake is well-positioned to benefit from the AI rally. Snowflake’s CEO Frank Slootman said: “There is no AI strategy without a data strategy.”\n\nThe company focuses on data management services, collecting and analysing an organisation’s data to deliver insights that help businesses grow. The rise of AI has made this data even more valuable.\n\nThe demand for Snowflake’s data management platform has driven strong revenue growth. In its 2024 fiscal year, Snowflake achieved $2.8bn in sales, up 36% from the prior year’s $2.1bn. The company expects its revenue to continue expanding, estimating $3.3bn in sales for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, analysts remain cautious, which could mean the share is currently undervalued.\n\n“Waning optimisation headwinds and emerging new product initiatives should support growth, but investors may need more concrete signals to get on board,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a report.\n\nSeven analysts have a \"strong buy\" recommendation for Snowflake’s shares, and 24 rate it as a \"buy\", according to Yahoo Finance data. The market consensus sees the share price trading at $166, higher than the current $118, with $220 as the high range for the stock.\n\nRolls Royce (RR.L) Rolls Royce has surprised investors under new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIt is not part of the Magnificent Seven, it does not list under Europe’s Granola’s and it is part of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which Nvidia alone has overtaken in value. So how can Rolls Royce be a Mag 7 alternative?\n\nThe company has delivered a total shareholder return of 221% over the past year, matching Nvidia's performance. This surprise achievement reflects growing investor confidence in the turnaround plan laid out by new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic.\n\nHis vision for Rolls-Royce is ambitious, aiming to transform the company into a leaner, more profitable enterprise with a bright future. Erginbilgic’s has set out to achieve a dramatic increase in adjusted operating profits from about £250m to between £2.5bn and £2.8bn by 2027.\n\nThis growth is underpinned by a strategy to unlock £2bn in working capital savings, primarily through better inventory management. These efficiencies are expected to help the company boost free cash flow from £500m to between £2.8bn and £3.1bn over the next five years.\n\nSince Erginbilgic joined, shares have more than quadrupled to top London’s premier index. That rally is made all the more remarkable given the struggles that gripped Rolls-Royce in the years prior, which included a very close brush with bankruptcy during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest turnaround is expected to happen at the civil aviation business, which accounts for nearly half of group sales. The rest of its revenues are split relative evenly between Rolls-Royce’s defence and power systems divisions.\n\nErginbilgic believes civil aviation’s adjusted operating margins can be lifted from 2.5% to between 14.5% and 16.5% by 2027. While the improvement looks dramatic, these levels of profitability are comparable to those of some rivals.\n\nThe current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Rolls-Royce stands at 18. While some investors may argue that this valuation isn't cheap, it's also not particularly expensive for a blue-chip company within the FTSE 100.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Nvidia's Big Day Is Here: What to Expect When the AI Giant Reports After the Bell",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is at the epicenter of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It designs the most powerful data center chips for AI development, and demand continues to outstrip supply which is driving a surge in the company's revenue and earnings.\n\nAfter the closing bell today -- at around 5:00pm Eastern Time and 2:00pm Pacific -- Nvidia will release its financial results for its fiscal 2025's second quarter (ended July 31). The report will give investors a fresh look at the chip giant's sales, and what it expects for the rest of this year.\n\nHere's what you need to know! Image source: Nvidia.\n\nWall Street expects another blowout revenue number\n\nNvidia's official guidance points to $28 billion in total revenue for Q2, representing 107% growth compared to the year-ago period. That might be conservative, though, because Wall Street's consensus estimate has steadily climbed over the last couple of months and currently stands at $28.7 billion (according to LSEG).\n\nConsidering Nvidia delivered $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter (ended April 28), which was a whopping $2 billion more than the company had originally forecast, it's no surprise that analysts think a beat is in the cards for Q2.\n\nThe data center segment accounted for $22.6 billion of Nvidia's total Q1 revenue. All eyes will be on that number in the Q2 report because Nvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for the data center are critical to AI development. According to Wall Street, it could come in somewhere between $24.5 billion and $25.2 billion -- any result above the high end of that range will likely spark a fresh wave of enthusiasm in Nvidia stock.\n\nTech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (to name a few) have each committed to spending tens of billions of dollars on AI data center infrastructure this year, and a significant amount of that money will flow directly to Nvidia through GPU sales.\n\nThat includes sales of the H100 GPU which set the benchmark for the industry last year, and the more recent H200 which can perform AI inference at twice the pace of its predecessor. But there's also an entirely new generation of chips on the way.\n\nExpect an update on Nvidia's new Blackwell chips\n\nEarlier this year, Nvidia announced a new GPU architecture called Blackwell. It's designed to accommodate trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) which, until now, have only been developed by leading AI companies like OpenAI.\n\nBlackwell-based GPUs will be capable of substantially higher performance relative to their predecessors, and Nvidia says they will also be significantly more energy efficient. For example, the new DGX B200 system combines eight Blackwell B200 GPUs and can train AI models three times faster, performing AI inference 15 times faster, than the older DGX H100 system.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says B200 GPUs will be priced at around $30,000 to $40,000, which is in the ballpark of what many customers paid for their H100 GPUs. In other words, given the substantial performance benefits, Blackwell will make it far more cost-efficient for businesses to access and deploy the most advanced AI models.\n\nAccording to comments from Huang back in May, Nvidia should have started shipping Blackwell GPUs to customers in Q2, with sales ramping up as the year progresses. However, a recent report by The Information suggests a three-month delay could be due to a technical issue with the next-generation chips.\n\nNvidia hasn't confirmed those rumored delays, but investors should listen closely for comments on Q2 Blackwell sales and any update to its guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2025. Huang previously said he expects to see \"a lot\" of Blackwell revenue this year, so any variation to the company's timeline could substantially impact its future financial results.\n\nHere's how Nvidia stock might react\n\nNvidia stock has soared 765% since the start of 2023, when the AI boom really started ramping up. It's now a $3.1 trillion company, so even a small move in its stock can be worth billions of dollars to its valuation.\n\nWhile the performance of any stock on a given day is mostly noise, Nvidia reported its Q1 earnings after the bell on May 22, and its stock jumped 9.3% the following day. Remember, the company beat its revenue guidance by $2 billion on that occasion, so it's possible that a similar result this time around could yield a comparable increase in its stock price.\n\nWith that said, Nvidia stock is currently trading 7% below its all-time high following a steep market correction earlier this month, and if the company delivers weaker results than expected, its stock could slip into a much deeper drawdown.\n\nHowever, Nvidia stock appears cheap right now for investors with a multi-year time horizon. Wall Street expects the company to deliver $0.64 in earnings per share in Q2, which will take its trailing 12-month earnings to $2.17. That places the stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58.3.\n\nAlthough that's almost twice as expensive as the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32, the picture appears very different when looking further into the future. Analysts predict Nvidia will generate $3.81 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026, placing the stock at a more reasonable forward P/E ratio of 33.2.\n\nIn other words, as long as Nvidia's Q2 report doesn't produce a negative surprise, its stock looks like a good value at the current price for investors who can stay the course for at least the next couple of years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, Broadcom and Texas Instruments",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – August 28, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Texas Instruments Inc.’s TXN.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nShould You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVIDIA Stock Before Q2 Earnings?\n\nAfter finishing 2023 on a high note, NVIDIA Corporation squashed bubble fears, and its shares soared 155.4% year to date, outperforming the Semiconductor - General industry’s gain of 113.8%. However, NVIDIA’s stock price faced hiccups in early August on fears that its tech customers may curtail artificial intelligence (AI) spending budgets.\n\nBut NVIDIA’s shares did recover ahead of the much-awaited second-quarter fiscal earnings report that can have rippling effects on the broader tech sector. Therefore, investors are rightly contemplating whether to book profits and move on or hold on to NVIDIA’s shares for better returns in the future. Let us, thus, look at how to play NVIDIA’s shares as of now.\n\nNVIDIA’s High-Profit Margin – Unsustainable\n\nNVIDIA’s high profit margin may lead to its vulnerability soon. For first-quarter fiscal 2025, NVIDIA’s gross profit margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% a year ago. However, sustaining such higher profit margins is difficult as demand-supply disparity will lessen in the semiconductor industry where peers are also manufacturing commendable competing products.\n\nIn a competitive environment, NVIDIA would be compelled to lower the price of its products, and profit margins could take a beating. Huawei is planning to introduce its Ascend 910C chips as early as October, which can compete with NVIDIA’s H100 AI chips. Moreover, any possible trade ban on NVIDIA from selling its H20 AI chips to China may hit its profit margins.\n\nWhy You Shouldn’t Sell NVIDIA Stock\n\nNVIDIA benefits from tech behemoths’ spending on AI-related infrastructure. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, mega-tech capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending is expected to rise, a blessing for NVIDIA.\n\nAI, anyhow, is a growing trend and not a temporary phenomenon. NVIDIA’s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares rise. MarketsandMarkets estimated the AI industry to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA is also well-poised to make the most of the growing gaming market through its primary gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce. According to research firm Newzoo, the global gaming market will generate $187.7 billion in revenues this year. At the same time, NVIDIA is collaborating with Siemens to build an industrial metaverse, a market that is expected to reach $228.6 billion in 2029 from $28.7 billion in 2024, per MarketsandMarkets.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors regarding the production delay of NVIDIA’s Blackwell AI chips may have caused a lot of concerns. But NVIDIA recently confirmed that Blackwell sampling has begun, and the next-generation chips will be launched later this year. NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in AI chip design and software, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals.\n\nWhat’s more, NVIDIA is yet again expected to post encouraging earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which may help its share prices to climb. NVIDIA is projected to report earnings per share of $0.63 for the fiscal second quarter, more than $0.27 a year ago, indicating a jump of 133.3%.\n\nNVIDIA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%, a tell-tale indication that the stock has a reasonable chance to display earnings growth in the forthcoming earnings release on Wednesday, after the bell.\n\nNVIDIA Stock is Pricey – Here’s How to Trade it\n\nDespite the positives, buying the NVIDIA stock may burn a hole in your pocket. This is because the unquenchable demand for AI models and dominance in GPUs has made the NVIDIA stock expensive.\n\nBy looking at the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA’s rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.’s forward earnings multiples are 44.6X, 16.9X, 33.8X and 40.7X, respectively.\n\nHence, astute investors should wait to buy on the dips. And those who have already bought NVIDIA’s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as AI is here to stay. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "European Stocks Eye Gains as Nvidia Earnings Loom: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian equities slipped on Wednesday as weak corporate earnings in China raised fresh concerns over its flagging economy. Traders are also awaiting Nvidia Corp.’s results for cues on the growth momentum of artificial-intelligence related stocks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City\n\nChinese stocks in Hong Kong fell as much as 1.5%, while those in the mainland declined to their lowest since early February. Bottled water maker Nongfu Spring Co. shares plunged as much as 13% after posting the slowest half-year profit growth in four years, becoming the latest company to issue disappointing results.\n\n“So far we are still seeing much more downgrades than upgrades” in Chinese earnings, Winnie Wu, a China equity strategist at Bank of America Corp., told Bloomberg TV. Internet companies are outperforming other sectors in beating earnings expectations, but materials, tech, builders, auto and other industries pose significant downside risks, she said.\n\nMost major benchmarks across the region were in the red, with Japan and South Korea also seeing losses. Two-year Treasury yields, which are more sensitive to interest-rate policy, fell three basis points.\n\nWeak sentiment toward China reemerged following sluggish outlook guidance earlier this week from e-commerce firm PDD Holdings Inc. The drum beat of stuttering growth has continued through the commentary of other companies.\n\nANTA Sports Products Ltd. on Tuesday also lowered its full-year sales guidance for one of its core brands amid expectations that it would need to hand out more discounts to woo buyers in the country. Meanwhile, Australia’s Fortescue Ltd. reported full-year profit that missed analyst forecasts, partly due to a slowdown in iron demand demand from biggest customer China.\n\nCnooc Ltd., BYD Co. and Meituan are all set to report on Wednesday. Later in the US, investors will be looking for any clues on whether the artificial-intelligence euphoria has more room to run, with the world’s currently most influential stock, Nvidia, set to report earnings.\n\n“We are seeing a weaker showing in Asia today, potentially as the lead-up to Nvidia’s results tonight may limit risk-taking,” Jun Rong Yeap, a market strategist with IG Asia Pte., said. “Nvidia’s results will be looked upon as a make-or-break moment for global markets, given the extreme optimism priced around AI stocks over the past year.”\n\nStory continues\n\nA gauge of Australian monthly inflation cooled in July, suggesting price pressures began to ease in the current quarter though not fast enough to warrant early interest-rate cuts. The Australian dollar was steady against the greenback after rising as much as 0.3%.\n\nThe yen extended losses to 0.4% against the dollar, following comments from Bank of Japan’s Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino. The BOJ will raise interest rates as long as inflation moves in line with the bank’s view, and it must monitor developments with “utmost vigilance,” Himino said.\n\nSeven & i Holdings Co. shares slipped after the operator of 7-Eleven stores sought a national security-related designation from authorities in a move that may raise potential hurdles for a takeover. Its application came after Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. approached the company last week.\n\nSony Group Corp. saw its shares climb as much as 2.7% after saying it will hike the price of its PlayStation 5 in Japan.\n\n“Ultimately what is more important are the economic fundamentals for Japan, which are improving,” David Chao, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “That certainly will be what will drive the Japanese market up in the second half of this year.”\n\nIn other Asian corporate developments, HSBC Holdings Plc’s shares rose in Hong Kong to outperform the benchmark, after Bloomberg reported that Europe’s largest bank is considering plans that could remove layers of middle management.\n\nShares of China’s top-selling automaker BYD fell as much as 3.1% in Hong Kong despite saying it expects overseas deliveries to account for almost half of total sales in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold an additional $982 million in Bank of America shares, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nIn other markets, Bitcoin fell below the $60,000 level early Wednesday as part of a broad crypto market retreat that included a sharp drop in second-largest token Ether.\n\nOil was steady after sliding in the previous session to end a three-day rally. Gold retreated after a three-day advance that’s taken it closer to its all-time high.\n\nNvidia Earnings\n\nInvestors are gearing up for big swings in Nvidia’s shares after the $3.2 trillion company reports. Trading in the options market implies a nearly 10% move in either direction on the day following the results. The stock has rallied about 160% this year and 1,000% from its October 2022 bear-market low.\n\nAnalysts, on average, are predicting that the giant chipmaker will project revenue growth of more than 70% for the current quarter. Some are estimating an even larger surge. Nvidia’s results and forecast also will serve as a barometer for AI spending across much of the technology industry.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nNvidia earnings, Wednesday Fed’s Raphael Bostic and Christopher Waller speak, Wednesday Eurozone consumer confidence, Thursday US GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday Japan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday Eurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday US personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures were little changed as of 1:12 p.m. Tokyo time Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.2% Japan’s Topix was little changed Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.4% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1% The Shanghai Composite fell 0.2% Euro Stoxx 50 futures were little changed\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1% The euro fell 0.2% to $1.1166 The Japanese yen fell 0.4% to 144.48 per dollar The offshore yuan fell 0.2% to 7.1322 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 3.7% to $59,552.98 Ether fell 4.2% to $2,474.36\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.83% Australia’s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to 3.94%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changed Spot gold fell 0.4% to $2,514.60 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFar-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook\n\nNvidia is holding the investment world in thrall ahead of an earnings report later today that, even if it delivers the expected doubling of second-quarter revenue, may not satisfy investors accustomed to market-moving outperformance.\n\nThe chipmaker's market value was around $390 billion on the eve of the launch of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT, less than two years ago.\n\nNow it is nearly $3.2 trillion, and in June it swaggered, briefly, to a turn as the most valuable company on earth, powered by chips that provide the hardware behind the AI computing boom.\n\nSheer size and its position as an industry bellwether mean its earnings, due after the U.S. close on Wednesday, can move the entire market.\n\nTrade in Asia was light and moves modest ahead of the release, and European equity futures were flat.\n\nEurope's data and reporting calendar is mostly bare, with Eurozone broad money growth seen rising to 2.7%, while markets are focused on Nvidia's results ahead of European and U.S. inflation measures due later in the week.\n\nOptions prices show traders have braced for a near 10% swing in Nvidia's shares when they trade on Thursday, translating in dollar terms to more than $300 billion in market value - likely the largest ever market move on an earnings report.\n\nThat would dwarf the market capitalisation of 95% of S&P 500 constituents, according to LSEG data, and probably send shockwaves through the global semiconductor sector.\n\nElsewhere, sterling sat near a 2-1/2 year high on Wednesday as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a slide in the dollar. Traders anticipate about 100 basis points of U.S. interest rate cuts this year against only 40 bps in Britain.\n\nAs the markets await Nvidia's turn at centre stage, fans of Oasis, which signed its first record deal in 1993 just a few weeks after Nvidia's founding, can join the scramble for Mancunian hotel rooms after the announcement of planned Oasis reunion shows next year.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Wednesday:\n\nEarnings: Nvidia\n\nEconomics: Eurozone M3 growth, French unemployment\n\n(By Tom Westbrook; Editing by Edmund Klamann)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) —\n\nNvidia has led the artificial intelligence boom to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company's chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The company is now worth over $3 trillion, with its dominance as a chipmaker cementing Nvidia’s place as the poster child of the AI industry ahead of the release of its latest financial results Wednesday.\n\nWall Street expects the company to report second-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share on revenue of $28.74 billion, more than double what it earned in the comparable quarter one year ago, according to FactSet. In the past three quarters, revenue has more than tripled on an annual basis, with the vast majority of growth coming from the data center business.\n\nDemand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year, but Wall Street is also looking for any indication that AI demand is waning.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of founder and CEO Jensen Huang's successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.\n\nNvidia will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Wednesday.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were mostly lower Wednesday, despite a record high on Wall Street, as investors awaited a closely watched earnings report from Nvidia.\n\nJapan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 slid nearly 0.3% in morning trading to 38,188.50.\n\nToyota stock jumped more than 3% after Japanese media reported Japan’s top automaker was going to announce a cooperative agreement on fuel cells with European automaker BMW.\n\nFuel cell vehicles are ecological, running on electricity produced when hydrogen and oxygen combines to form water. Japanese business daily Nikkei reported a partnership will be announced next week.\n\nToyota Motor Corp., often criticized as falling behind the global push in electric vehicles, is a longtime proponent of fuel cells.\n\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.6% to 8,024.70. Australia’s headline index of inflation for July fell less than expected, down 3.5% from the previous year.\n\nSouth Korea’s Kospi declined 0.5% to 2,674.72\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng, which has been rising steadily in recent sessions, dipped 0.8% to 17,735.39. Analysts believe the higher-than-expected China’s industrial profits reported this week isn’t great enough to maintain the optimism. The Shanghai Composite dipped 0.3% to 2,839.34.\n\nAll eyes are on the upcoming Nvidia earnings report. Big tech companies like Nvidia have become extremely influential lately, if not overblown, with the artificial intelligence company’s total market value topping $3 trillion.\n\nNvidia reports its latest results on Wednesday. It rose 1.5% on Tuesday and has made a 159% gain this year.\n\n“That’s the major question, and I think all eyes will be on Nvidia as they report this week,” said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “That’s kind of the elephant in the room, so to speak, that many investors will focus on.”\n\nAlso high on investors’ watch is the expectation for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in September. Investors are looking ahead to Friday, when the U.S. government releases its latest data on inflation with the PCE, or personal consumption and expenditures report, for July.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9 points, or less than 0.1%, which was good enough for its second all-time high in two days. The index is on an eight-day winning streak.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each finished 0.2% higher after drifting between small gains and losses most of the day. The benchmark S&P 500 is now within 0.8% of its record high set last month. Slightly more stocks closed lower than those that posted gains on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a bit of positive news, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its U.S. consumer confidence index rose to 103.3 in August from 101.9 in July. Consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic activity.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 8.96 points to 5,625.80. The Dow rose 9.98 points to 41,250.50, and the Nasdaq gained 29.05 points to close at 17,754.82.\n\nTreasury yields held steady in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.83% from 3.82% late Monday.\n\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 22 cents to $75.75 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 25 cents to $79.80 a barrel.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 144.35 Japanese yen from 143.91 yen. The euro cost $1.1179, down from $1.1188.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed. Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Tom Westbrook\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global stocks were poised near record highs on Wednesday, with the next move riding on results at chipmaking market darling Nvidia, while sterling notched a 2-1/2 year high as traders bet that Britain will lag the U.S. in cutting interest rates.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.2%.\n\nOil retraced a recent spike on Middle East tensions as gloom on Chinese demand returned to the fore and Brent crude futures traded just below $80 a barrel. [O/R]\n\nNvidia's market value has ballooned thanks to its dominance of the computing hardware behind artificial intelligence. The stock price is up some 3000% since 2019 and with a market capitalisation of $3.2 trillion, a move in its shares affects the entire market.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue will likely have doubled, though even that may disappoint expectations. Options pricing shows traders anticipate a near 10% - or $300 billion - swing in market value, likely the largest earnings move of any company, ever.\n\nThe results at the \"so-called 'most important company in the world,'\" stand between Wall Street and fresh record highs, noted Capital.com analyst Kyle Rodda, and set the tone for the sector.\n\n\"The company’s revenue and sales guidance is a barometer of AI capex, with inferences to be drawn about the health of the other mega-cap tech names,\" he said.\n\nThe S&P 500 went up about 0.2% overnight and futures drifted 0.1% lower in Asia, while Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%.\n\nE-commerce shares stabilised in Hong Kong - where the Hang Seng slipped 0.5% - after taking a kicking following downbeat remarks from discount online retailer PDD Holdings earlier in the week.\n\nChina's biggest sportswear maker, Anta, was the top gainer and shares were up 8.5% after better-than-expected profits and $1.3 billion buyback. Shares in Australian gambling company Tabcorp slid 12% and headed for their largest drop since 2020 after the company wrote down asset prices and said rising costs meant it would miss earnings targets.\n\nDebt and currency markets were steady in the Asia session, though the Australian dollar popped up about 0.2% to touch its highest since January at $0.6813 after monthly inflation data was slightly higher than market expectations.\n\nGlobally a weakening dollar in anticipation of U.S. rate cuts has lifted most other currencies because markets see U.S. short-term rates, currently above 5.25%, as having furthest to fall. The yen traded at 144.32 per dollar.\n\nInterest rate futures price 100 basis points of U.S. rate cuts this year and last week Fed Chair Jerome Powell endorsed an imminent start to cuts saying \"the time has come\". The tone contrasts with caution at the Bank of England, which has helped sterling become the top-performing G10 currency with a 4.1% gain for the year-to-date.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt hit its highest in more than two years overnight at $1.3269 and hovered near that level on Wednesday. [GBP/]\n\n\"UK services sector inflation...is still uncomfortably high,\" Rabobank senior strategist Jane Foley said in a note.\n\n\"In our view, the BoE is likely to only cut rates once a quarter going forward,\" she said, against a forecast for four consecutive 25 bp cuts from the Fed from September to January.\n\nRates markets were steady with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields at 3.83%, two-year yields at 3.87% and the gap between the two its narrowest in nearly three weeks.\n\nHeavy selling in the New York evening drove bitcoin down 4% on the dollar to $59,350. Gold held at $2,517 an ounce.\n\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday, with heavyweight technology stocks remaining fragile in anticipation of earnings from Nvidia- which are set to shed more light on the AI trade.\n\nA rotation out of tech picked up this week amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This notion also supported flows into more economically sensitive sectors, which put Wall Street indexes at record highs.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.2% to 5,633.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.4% to 19,576.0 points by 19:30 ET (23:30 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 41,313.0 points.\n\nNvidia earnings set to provide more cues on AI\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world’s most valuable chipmaker, is set to report its May-July earnings after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe firm is expected to clock earnings per share at $0.644 on a revenue of $28.68 billion, with both readings picking up from the prior quarter.\n\nNvidia’s shares fell slightly in aftermarket trade, but were sitting on a nearly 160% spike so far in 2024, as the firm benefited greatly from increasing investment in artificial intelligence. The firm makes the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the market, and is considered as a bellwether for AI demand.\n\nNvidia’s earnings also come after reports from a slew of other tech majors suggested that AI may not be as big an earnings driver as initially thought- a notion that had triggered sharp losses in tech valuations over the past month.\n\nWall St buoyed by rate cut bets; Dow, S&P at record highs\n\nBut despite some uncertainty over Nvidia and a rotation out of technology, Wall Street indexes were buoyed by expectations of lower interest rates, especially after Fed officials struck a dovish tone in recent addresses.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2% and ended at a record-high close of 5,625.80 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up to a record-high finish of 41,250.50 points on Tuesday. The NASDAQ Composite rose 0.2% to 17,755.58 points, but remained well below recent peaks.\n\nInvestors are now almost entirely pricing in an interest rate cut in September, but are split over a 25 or 50 basis point reduction, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nPCE price index data- which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- is due later this week and is expected to provide more cues on a potential rate cut.\n\nJobless claims data due on Thursday is also expected to factor into expectations of a cut, especially amid growing anxiety that the labor market is cooling much more rapidly than expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures tick lower as Nvidia earnings loom\n\nUkraine's drones set oil depot in Russia's Rostov ablaze, Russian Telegram channels say\n\nBrazil miner Vale's CEO announcement to curb market speculation, says chairman\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is slated to report its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended July 28, 2024) on Wednesday, Aug. 28, after the market close.\n\nNvidia's upcoming earnings release is widely considered the most anticipated of this quarterly earnings season. That's because the company is viewed as a bellwether, or indicator, for the AI space and the overall market.\n\nNvidia dominates the rapidly growing AI chip market. If it delivers stronger-than-expected results -- particularly in its AI-driven data center business -- that suggests the broad AI market is probably more robust than widely believed.\n\nNvidia stock's performance has also become an indicator of the likely strength of the overall market. Nvidia is the second-largest stock on the S&P 500 index (behind Apple) and has been skyrocketing since early 2023, so it's been a huge driver of the index's overall performance.\n\nMy two-part prediction is that (1) Nvidia will beat Wall Street's earnings estimate, and (2) it will do so by at least 10%. We will get to where the 10% came from.\n\nNvidia's Q2 guidance and Wall Street's estimates\n\nMetric Q2 Fiscal 2024 Result Nvidia's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Guidance Nvidia's Projected Growth Wall Street's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Consensus Estimate Wall Street's Projected Growth Revenue $13.51 billion $28 billion 107% $28.68 billion 112% Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $0.27* $0.622** 130% $0.64 137%\n\nData sources: Nvidia and Yahoo!

This data goes back to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended in late July 2020. Below is the summary.\n\nPeriod Period Description Earnings* Results Relative to Wall Street's Consensus Estimate Magnitude of Earnings Beat (Average) Magnitude of Earnings Beat (Range) Most recently reported 16 quarters Full data set 14/16 beats = 88% 12% 5% to 32% 11 quarters, starting six quarters ago and going back Data set period prior to generative AI being called out as a major growth driver 9/11 beats = 82% 8% 5% to 14% Most recently reported five quarters Period in which generative AI has been a major growth driver 5/5 beats = 100% 18% 10% to 32%\n\nData source: Nvidia. Calculations by author. *Earnings in the form of adjusted earnings per share (EPS). AI = artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet's home in on the five-quarter period in which generative AI (the tech behind Open AI's ChatGPT and other chatbots) became a major growth driver.

Finance, and YCharts.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nNvidia has exceeded Wall Street's earnings estimate in every quarter since generative AI became a major growth driver. Nvidia's earnings beats, on average, have become larger in, let's call it, the generative AI era.\n\nPrediction: Nvidia will surpass Wall Street's earnings estimate by at least 10%\n\nLast quarter, Nvidia beat the Street's earnings estimate by 10%. In the last five quarters -- the generative AI era -- the company's earnings beat has generally decreased in size: 10% (most recent), 12%, 19%, 32%, and 18%. So, I'm using the smallest earnings beat as my prediction. I'm using the smallest and not, say, the average because of the trend in the data.\n\nThe bigger picture: Nvidia stock is likely not as pricey as it might seem\n\nSince generative AI entered the scene, Nvidia's earnings beats have become notably bigger (averaging 18%). I think this trend will continue.\n\nThe data in this article weakens the argument that goes something like: \"Nvidia stock is overvalued because its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is X.\" (The forward P/E is 46.2, as of Aug. 26.) A forward P/E uses an estimate for the earnings value, generally Wall Street's. And those estimates are likely notably too low, which inflates the forward P/E.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia are set to edge lower after a sluggish day on Wall Street, as traders look to Nvidia Corp.’s results for clues on whether the artificial-intelligence euphoria that’s powered the bull market has more room to run.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City\n\nFutures for equity benchmarks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney pointed down, and those for the US also nudged lower in early trading. The giant chipmaker is set to report earnings after Wednesday’s session, with investors waiting to see whether the AI darling will at least match lofty estimates.\n\nInvestors are gearing up for big swings in Nvidia’s shares after the $3.2 trillion company led by Jensen Huang reports. Trading in the options market implies a nearly 10% move in either direction on the day following the results. The stock has rallied about 160% this year and 1,000% from its October 2022 bear-market low.\n\nTo Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research, Nvidia’s results will set the tone for markets before a key US payrolls report on Sept. 6.\n\n“We remain bullish, but risks are now skewed to the downside over the very near-term,” Senyek said. “From a seasonal perspective, we enter a weaker period that is even more amplified in election years.”\n\nIn other markets, Bitcoin fell below the $60,000 level early Wednesday as part of a broad crypto market retreat that included a sharp drop in second-largest token Ether. Oil gained.\n\nThe S&P 500 edged higher to around 5,625 on Tuesday while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers added 1.1%. Nvidia climbed 1.5%. Super Micro Computer Inc. slid 2.6% after Hindenburg Research said it’s short the maker of server equipment.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields rose one basis point to 3.83% and a $69 billion US sale of two-year notes was well-received.\n\nWith questions swirling around Federal Reserve policy, the state of the economy and the US presidential race, at least one thing seems clear on Wall Street: spending on AI is still key.\n\nConcerns about the returns of those investments recently contributed to a tech selloff, although that dip was readily bought. AI hardware and chip companies have led the bounce in the Nasdaq 100 from its August low, with Nvidia up about 30%.\n\nNvidia accounts for more than 6% of the S&P 500’s market cap in terms of its index weight, so “it’s increasingly a bigger component of where the trend and momentum of the market goes,” Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management told Bloomberg Surveillance. If the giant chipmaker fails to deliver, or even just meets expectations, “I think it’s more of a risk-off environment,” he said, “not necessarily fuel for rotation.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts, on average, are predicting that the giant chipmaker will project revenue growth of more than 70% for the current quarter. Some are estimating an even larger surge. Nvidia’s results and forecast also will serve as a barometer for AI spending across much of the technology industry.\n\nOn the economic front, data showed US consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August as more upbeat views of the economy and inflation offset waning optimism about the labor market.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 is now nearly back to its all-time high in the wake of Powell’s recent dovish message, underlying risk premia are still somewhat larger than before the July correction began and the previously all-conquering “AI” narrative still is yet to fully recover, according to Jonas Goltermann at Capital Economics.\n\n“Provided that the US economy manages a soft landing, as we continue to anticipate, and enthusiasm around AI rebounds further, we forecast the S&P 500 will hit 6,000 by the end of the year,” he said.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nNvidia earnings, Wednesday Fed’s Raphael Bostic and Christopher Waller speak, Wednesday Eurozone consumer confidence, Thursday US GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday Japan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday Eurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday US personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nHang Seng futures fell 0.2% as of 7:24 a.m. Tokyo time Nikkei 225 futures fell 0.2% S&P/ASX 200 futures fell 0.4% The S&P 500 rose 0.2%; futures fell 0.2%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 4.7% to $59,987.81 Ether fell 5.4% to $2,444.44\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 3.82%\n\nCommodities\n\nSpot gold was little changed West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.4% to $75.84 a barrel\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFar-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q2 earnings could spark an AI rally—or trigger a panicked sell-off",
        "content": "It’s been called the \"most important tech earnings in years.” Whether or not the claim from famous tech bull Dan Ives was hyperbole, there’s no doubt, as he put it, that “the popcorn [is] getting ready.” Wall Street is expecting another blowout quarter from the world’s premier chip stock, and Wednesday’s results have the potential to boost a sector-wide rally—or, if the company comes up short, cause stocks to tumble.\n\nNvidia’s earnings are a referendum on both AI investment and the semiconductor industry, multiple industry analysts told Fortune, because of the company's dominant position producing the advanced graphic processing units, or GPUs, at the heart of the AI boom. Nvidia’s breakneck growth will inevitably decelerate, they added (year-on-year growth over 250% isn’t sustainable forever!) Risks ranging from competitive to macroeconomic to geopolitical loom in the coming years, but the good times should at least endure for now.\n\n“The bottom line is they're shipping to clients, mainly Microsoft, [Amazon Web Services] and Meta, as much as they can manufacture,” said Ted Mortonson, a managing director and technology desk sector strategist at Baird. “They’re going to have another unbelievable quarter.”\n\nThe Gen AI wave has rapidly made Nvidia one of the world’s most powerful companies. Revenue jumped 262% to over $26 billion last quarter, beating expectations by over $1 billion, compared to just over $7 billion the year before. The company is now the second-largest company in the U.S. by market cap, which has grown nearly $2 trillion this past year to just north of $3.1 trillion.\n\nThis has allowed investors to reap massive gains. The stock has grown over 166% year-to-date, trading above the $128 mark at Tuesday’s close. Investors who have held the stock over the past five years have seen shares gain roughly 3,000%, nearly doubling their investment year-over-year.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nThe company’s broader impact on the overall market has also been staggering. As Big Tech dragged the S&P 500 to record highs during the first half of the year, Nvidia accounted for nearly 30% of the index’s total return during that span.\n\nFrom an earnings perspective, though, Nvidia will inevitably soon become a victim of its own success. Even Wall Street’s AI darling will run up against the law of large numbers.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\n“These comparisons are biblical,” Mortonson said. “I have never seen a company for the last year exceed expectations to this degree, and it's not Nvidia's fault. They're just running into brutally tough comparisons.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis deceleration, however, is already partially baked into the stock price, according to Angelo Zino, a senior vice president and tech equity analyst at CFRA Research.\n\n“When you look at the valuation of this company,” he said, “it's trading at a big discount to where it actually historically trades at.”\n\nAt its last earnings call, Nvidia forecast revenue of $28 billion, still well over double last year’s number, with the Street expecting the chipmaker to beat its own guidance by over $800 million.\n\nWhether or not the company meets those estimates will be viewed by many as a barometer for the state of both AI investment and the semiconductor industry overall. Given the supremacy of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs, eventually set to be replaced by its next generation Blackwell line, they’re basically a proxy for demand, Zino noted, across the AI spectrum.\n\n“Nvidia is kind of perceived as the center of the universe when it comes to this AI trade,” he said.\n\nFortunately for chip makers, the tech giants feel compelled to spend on AI like “drunken sailors,” as Mortonson put it, a phenomenon he and Zino don’t see slowing much over the next year. With Nvidia getting more orders than it can fill, semiconductor companies like Micron, Marvell and Broadcom also stand to benefit.\n\n“The big takeaway is what's good for Nvidia is typically good for a lot of the other chip makers that kind of sell into the data center space,” Zino said.\n\nAs if investors didn’t already have enough reasons to tune in.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jamie McGeever\n\n(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets.\n\nThe mood across Asian markets on Wednesday is likely to be one of caution, for two main reasons that should keep markets in relatively narrow ranges - lingering concern over the health of the U.S. economy, and Nvidia's earnings later in the day.\n\nU.S. and world stocks climbed higher on Tuesday but only slightly, while the dollar dipped again and Treasury yields were little-changed across the curve. None of that offers investors in Asia much to run with on Wednesday.\n\nGiven the lack of obvious global catalysts, regional events may take on added weight on Wednesday.\n\nBank of Japan Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino is scheduled to speak. This follows BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's first public remarks last week since the central bank's 'hawkish hike' in July.\n\nUeda's tone on Friday was also hawkish, indicating that current rates are still well below 'neutral'. This strengthens the case for further tightening this year beyond the mere 7 basis points of hikes rates markets are currently discounting.\n\nThe main economic indicator across the Asia/Pacific region on Wednesday will be Australian inflation. Economists polled by Reuters expect annual weighted consumer price inflation to have slowed to 3.4% in July from 3.8% in June.\n\nThat would be the lowest since February and closer to getting inflation back in the central bank's 2%-3% target range for the first time since 2021. The Reserve Bank of Australia has held its cash rate at 4.35% since November last year, and last cut rates nearly five years ago.\n\nThe Aussie swaps market shows no rate cut is fully priced until December, with 100 bps of easing in total expected by the end of next year.\n\nThailand's deputy finance minister Julapun Amornvivat and central bank governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, meanwhile, both speak at a business seminar on Wednesday. This comes amid continued friction between the government and central bank over the path for interest rates.\n\nThe Bank of Thailand last week left rates on hold at 2.50% for a fifth meeting. But newly-sworn in Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has called central bank independence an \"obstacle\" to economic growth, and her predecessor repeatedly called for rates to be cut.\n\nDespite being an extremely low-yielding currency, the Thai baht has rallied strongly in recent weeks, perhaps because of the central bank's refusal to cut rates just yet. It is now the only one of seven key Asian currencies to be up against the U.S. dollar so far this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, if there is one discernible global driver for investors in Asia on Wednesday it is the U.S. dollar's persistent weakness, as the currency slipped to a fresh low for the year against a basket of major currencies.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Wednesday:\n\n- Australia inflation (July)\n\n- BOJ Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino speaks\n\n- Bank of Thailand Governor Suthiwartnarueput speaks\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What Nvidia’s much-anticipated earnings will tell us about the AI industry’s prospects overall",
        "content": "Can chipmaker Nvidia continue its years-long rocket ride that has made it the most valuable public company? Or will it disappoint investors by showing lost momentum?\n\nThe question has stock-watchers on the edge of their seats for Nvidia's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday afternoon. The results will give critical insight into the company's future and clues about the chip industry's financial performance overall.\n\n“It's the most important stock in the world right now,” EMJ Capital’s Eric Jackson told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” about Nvidia last week. Meanwhile, tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called Nvidia's upcoming report nothing less than “the most important tech earnings in years.”\n\nBut Nvidia's results won't necessarily shed light on the broader AI industry and whether the tens of billions of dollars poured into it will ultimately pay off. That’s because the AI boom isn’t just about Nvidia. It’s also about the AI cloud providers, AI startups, and legacy businesses scrambling to make money from AI tools. And that will take time to play out.\n\nThe primary market for Nvidia's AI chips, called GPUs, are companies training the biggest and most sophisticated AI models. They include OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nJust to give a sense of demand for Nvidia chips: Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, on its own, is hoarding nearly 350,000 GPUs, likely worth over $9 billion.\n\nBut most companies aren't training massive generative AI models, but instead using them to spit out information, or inference in industry jargon. While Nvidia sells chips for inference, it built its high-flying business on supplying chips necessary for the complicated work of training models. As the industry evolves, it is inference that is the bigger long-term opportunity, and there is more competition there for Nvidia.\n\nAlso, corporations usually do their inference work in the cloud. Big cloud providers like Amazon’s AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as AI cloud startups like Coreweave and Groq, are all helping companies power and grow their AI inference efforts. Their future of these providers is largely independent of Nvidia and therefore Nvidia's earnings don't reveal much about their financial performance. Additionally, the AI cloud industry will take time to mature, Daniel Newman, principal analyst of Futurum Research. He expects another one to three years of investment in AI infrastructure before the \"Walmart-like use cases\" of generative AI, or obvious successes in industries like retail, travel, and hospitality, are known.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, there are plenty of companies starting to incorporate AI into their software and operations, Newman said. But when it comes to actually making money and creating viable business models, that's \"still somewhat opaque.\"\n\nStock watchers will certainly focus on Nvidia for some time and whether its shares can continue to soar. After all, during its remarkable rise stock price since early 2023, the company's market value has increased nearly 10-fold from $350 billion to $3 trillion this summer.\n\nBut when it comes to the overall AI landscape, many on Wall Street are wondering whether generative AI can ever really become profitable. Patience is starting to wear thin 18 months after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, considered the watershed moment for the AI industry.\n\nDuring Microsoft’s earnings call a few weeks ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said that “right now, there’s an industry debate raging around the (capital expenditure) requirements around generative AI.\" Translation: Companies are spending billions on AI infrastructure, including GPUs and cloud, to power the generative AI revolution. But soon enough, their CEOs and boards will expect proof showing their investments are worthwhile.\n\nNvidia’s upcoming earnings results may indeed fuel more excitement about AI. But it may take several more years before the supersized investment in developing a true generative AI killer app finally produces one.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia results could spur record $300 billion swing in shares, options show",
        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the U.S. equity options market are expecting Nvidia's upcoming earnings report to spark a more than $300 billion swing in the shares of the world's most dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nOptions pricing shows that traders anticipate a move of around 9.8% in the company’s shares on Thursday, a day after it reports earnings, data from analytics firm ORATS showed. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, according to ORATS.\n\nGiven Nvidia's market capitalization of about $3.11 trillion, a 9.8% swing in the shares would translate to about $305 billion, likely the largest expected earnings move for any company in history, analysts said.\n\nSuch a move would dwarf the market capitalization of 95% of S&P 500 constituents, including Netflix and Merck, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe results from Nvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, also have big implications for the broader market. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500’s 18% year-to-date gain.\n\n\"It alone has been a huge contributor to the overall profitability of the S&P 500,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \"It's the Atlas holding up the market.\"\n\nOptions pricing suggests traders are more concerned about missing out on a large upside move from Nvidia than getting hurt by a large drop.\n\nTraders are assigning a 7% chance the stock rises more than 20% by Friday, while only a giving a 4% probability to a more than 20% sell-off, according to a Susquehanna Financial analysis of options data.\n\n\"(Ahead of earnings) people typically want to buy hedges, they want to buy insurance, but in Nvidia's case, a lot of that insurance is FOMO insurance,\" Sosnick said, referring to the popular acronym for \"fear of missing out.\"\n\n\"They don't want to miss a rally.\"\n\nPart of the reason options traders are pricing this large a move for Nvidia has to do with how volatile the company's shares have been in the past.\n\nNvidia's average 30-day historical volatility this year - a measure of how much the stock has gyrated over a rolling 30-day period - is about twice the average of the same measure for all other companies with market caps higher than $1 trillion, according to a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data.\n\n\"The options are just reflecting how the stock is actually moving,\" said Christopher Jacobson, a strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, which makes markets in the securities of Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"(It's) is just a function of continued uncertainty/optimism with regards to AI and the ultimate size of the opportunity coupled with NVDA having become such a widely followed stock among institutional and retail,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Good Ethical Company to Invest In?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Ethical Companies To Invest In According to Reddit.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other ethical companies to invest in.\n\nEthical investing involves choosing investments based on ethical principles, such as environmental, religious, or social values. Unlike socially conscious investing, which follows a specific set of guidelines, ethical investing is more individualized. Investors typically avoid being involved in gambling, alcohol, or firearms, and carefully research to make sure their investments align with their values.\n\nOther stocks that are avoided by ethical investors include the shares of companies where employees are mistreated, have high gender parity, or discriminate against employees due to their race, religion, or sexual orientation. Environmentally conscious companies are also a huge part of ethical investing.\n\nIs Ethical Investing the Future?\n\nA 2022 report by Stamford University noted that the younger generation considers ethical investing quite crucial. A 2022 survey of 2,470 individual investors, conducted by Stanford University's Rock Center for Corporate Governance, found significant differences in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) preferences based on age and wealth. Younger and wealthier investors are more likely to support ESG initiatives, even at the expense of returns, while older and less wealthy investors are generally opposed.\n\nOver recent years, support for ESG proposals has surged, with average support among S&P 500 companies increasing from 18% in 2012 to 35% in 2021, and the number of proposals passed rising from 0 to 28. The survey found that 70% of young investors (18-41 years old) are very concerned about environmental issues, compared to only 35% of older investors (58+ years old). Similarly, 65% of young investors are very concerned about social issues, versus 30% of older investors. When it comes to governance, 64% of younger investors express significant concern, while only 28% of older investors do.\n\nMoreover, 86% of older investors would not give up any or only a trivial amount of returns for carbon emission reductions, while 64% of younger investors would give up moderate or large amounts. Additionally, 91% of older investors are unwilling to sacrifice returns for workplace diversity improvements, compared to 62% of younger investors who are willing to do so.\n\nThe survey also found that investor attitudes towards ESG differ across fund companies. Investors in State Street and Invesco funds exhibit nearly twice the concern for environmental issues compared to those in Fidelity funds. A significant percentage of investors in Fidelity (40-45%) and Vanguard funds are unwilling to forfeit returns for ESG, while a smaller percentage in American Funds and BlackRock (25-30%) share this reluctance.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these differences, 83% of investors across all demographics believe that fund managers should consider their views when voting on ESG issues. The results suggest that fund managers might need to allocate votes on a proportional basis to reflect the diverse preferences of their investor base.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we scoured through several threads to discover which companies were considered ethical according to the users. We narrowed down the list to 7 stocks that were most widely mentioned and used the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as a tie-breaker. The companies are listed in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of the second quarter of 2024. The hedge fund data was taken from our database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based prominent tech company that is recognized for its groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI. Originally concentrating on the gaming sector, the company developed sophisticated graphics solutions but has since broadened its range to include high-performance computing, AI hardware, and software.\n\nIn its Graphics segment, it provides GeForce GPUs designed for gaming and personal computers, along with the GeForce NOW game streaming service. This segment also includes Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs aimed at enterprise workstations and Omniverse software for creating and managing metaverse environments.\n\nThe Compute and Networking segment covers a wide range of solutions, including data center computing platforms and comprehensive networking systems. This segment also features Jetson robotics and various embedded platforms, as well as NVIDIA AI Enterprise, among other offerings. It tops our list of the best ethical companies to invest in.\n\nIn the second quarter, 179 hedge funds held positions in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and their stakes amounted to $53.67 billion. As of June 30, Fisher Asset Management is the most dominant shareholder in the company and has a position worth $11.54 billion.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making significant strides in addressing environmental concerns within the technology sector, especially in the context of artificial intelligence. According to digital news brand, Stockhead, the company’s advancements in GPUs are evidence of this effort. Its GPUs are highly regarded for their efficiency compared to traditional central processing units (CPUs), particularly in handling AI workloads.\n\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, the GPUs are up to 20 times more energy-efficient for specific AI and high-performance computing tasks than CPUs. This efficiency is critical for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers, which are becoming increasingly important as the demand for AI technology grows.\n\nIn addition to their efficiency, the company’s RAPIDS Accelerator is an important innovation that further enhances environmental sustainability. By optimizing the processing capabilities of its GPUs, the RAPIDS Accelerator can potentially cut a data center’s carbon footprint by up to 80%.\n\nMajor companies such as Adobe and AT&T have tested this technology and reported faster processing speeds, reduced costs, and improvements in AI model training. Furthermore, the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center in Berkeley demonstrated a five-fold increase in energy efficiency by utilizing Nvidia’s A100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also made significant advancements in AI ethics as evidenced by initiatives led by Nikki Pope, the company’s first-ever head of AI and legal ethics. Her team has introduced a beta-testing process involving community resource groups from diverse backgrounds to help identify and address unintended biases in AI products. This approach ensures that the company’s AI models are not only more efficient but also more equitable and transparent.\n\nThe “Model Card++” project, which enhances the transparency of AI models by providing detailed information on privacy, safety, and bias, has been well-received and represents its commitment to ethical AI development. The company’s ability to deliver powerful, efficient solutions and its proactive approach to addressing AI ethics make it a compelling player in the tech industry.\n\nFurthermore, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) also seems to have a healthy work culture as the company promotes a collaborative and non-hierarchical work environment, where teams are formed based on project needs and innovation is encouraged, even at the risk of failure. It is dedicated to providing excellent pay, benefits, and a supportive work culture, allowing employees to do meaningful work.\n\nThe company offers several benefits to support employees and their families through various life events. These include resources for building a family, such as adoption, fertility, and surrogacy support, as well as assistance for developmental disabilities through RethinkCare. The company also provides college preparation resources through Collegewise, and offers support for life changes like marriage, divorce, having a child, moving, buying a home, and becoming eligible for Medicare. The company extends benefits for mourning, gender affirmation, and LGBTQ+ support, and offers guidance for those leaving the company.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of best ethical companies to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Will Nvidia (NVDA) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.98%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $0.61 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55 per share, representing a surprise of 10.91%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.52 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.04%.\n\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nNvidia has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 28, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cerebras Systems launched on Tuesday a tool for AI developers that allows them to access the startup's outsized chips to run applications, offering what it says is a much cheaper option than industry-standard Nvidia processors.\n\nAccess to Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) - often via a cloud computing provider - to train and deploy large artificial intelligence models used for applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT can be difficult to obtain and expensive to run, a process developers refer to as inference.\n\n\"We're delivering performance that cannot be achieved by a GPU,\" Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman told Reuters in an interview. \"We're doing it at the highest accuracy, and we're offering it at the lowest price.\"\n\nThe inference portion of the AI market is expected to be fast-growing and attractive - ultimately worth tens of billions of dollars if consumers and businesses adopt AI tools.\n\nThe Sunnyvale, California-based company plans to offer several types of the inference product via a developer key and its cloud. The company will also sell its AI systems to customers who prefer to operate their own data centers.\n\nCerebras' chips - each the size of a dinner plate and called Wafer Scale Engines - avoid one of the issues with AI data crunching: the data crunched by large models that power AI applications typically won't fit on a single chip and can require hundreds or thousands of chips strung together.\n\nThat means Cerebras' chips can achieve speedier performances, Feldman said.\n\nIt plans to charge users as little as 10 cents per million tokens, which are one of the ways companies can measure the amount of output data from a large model.\n\nCerebras is aiming to go public and filed a confidential prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission this month, the company said.\n\n(Reporting by Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cerebras Systems Inc., a startup that looks to challenge Nvidia Corp. in artificial intelligence computing, unveiled a new chip that it says will trounce rivals at running AI models and generating responses.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based company is offering the chip as part of computing systems that data center operators can buy and run themselves. It also will be available as a pay-as-you-go service run by Cerebras.\n\nThe startup, which has filed a confidential plan to sell shares in an initial public offering, is trying to carve out a piece of a burgeoning market. The largest companies in technology are pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI computing. The biggest beneficiary so far has been Nvidia, whose graphics processing units, or GPUs, are an essential part of this new infrastructure.\n\nBut Cerebras founder and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Feldman said his computers will upend the industry by making AI systems more responsive — a transition he compares to the shift to high-speed internet.\n\n“Up until today, we were in the dial-up era,” he said at an event in San Francisco ahead of the announcement of new products and services. “No number of GPUs can be cobbled together to achieve this.”\n\nCerebras’ approach relies on giant chips made from a single disk of silicon. Other processors — even the biggest and most powerful — are much smaller, and many of them can be made from one silicon wafer.\n\nThat novel technique allows chips to be more capable than their conventional counterparts, Cerebras says. But the company has to supply computers designed to house the outsized chips, since conventional hardware can’t accommodate them.\n\nAccording to Feldman, a key advantage comes from the way his products use memory. The capability is built right into Cerebras’ chips, unlike GPUs and other processors, which need to connect to memory through interfaces to access information.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia has a huge lead in AI infrastructure, and other rivals — such as Intel Corp. — have struggled to compete. Cerebras will have to make a case to the computing industry that it can reliably produce and deploy its technology.\n\nCerebras is setting up data centers of its own to provide AI computing as a service. It’s also trying to sell its chips to cloud providers, a group that includes Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. The startup has engaged with those companies, but doesn’t count them as customers yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen asked how much market share Feldman could take from Nvidia, he said, “Enough to make them angry.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFar-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\n\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company is famous for the graphic processing units (GPUs) it markets. These GPUs are capable of handling complex computational tasks that AI softwares demand, thus the claim to fame. The firm has been investing in AI-specific chips, a more AI-focused version of GPUs, since 2012. The GPU business has been making the waves since 2017, when the company launched Volta, a chip that could speed up performance by five times versus competitors. Various successors to Volta have since been released, most notably Ampere in 2020, Hopper in 2022, and the latest Blackwell, reportedly releasing early next year.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also has a sizable networking portfolio that will serve the company in good stead as AI infrastructure investment takes off. Ahead of the third quarter earnings report of the firm, expected next week, Wall Street analysts are bullish on the shares. Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $135. In a recent investor note, the advisory noted that the setup for NVIDIA was constructive with a compelling risk/reward on potential for positive earnings revisions.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares fell about 6% in New York trading Tuesday following the release of a critical report by short seller Hindenburg Research.\n\nThe research firm highlighted several concerns regarding the company's accounting practices and corporate governance, which could raise red flags among investors and shareholders.\n\nSMCI, a server maker valued at $35 billion, has been under scrutiny since a 2018 delisting from Nasdaq for not filing financial statements. Despite a $17.5 million settlement with the SEC in August 2020 for accounting violations, Hindenburg said the company resumed questionable practices shortly thereafter.\n\nAllegations include improper revenue recognition and rehiring executives involved in past accounting scandals.\r\n\r\n\"Less than 3 months after paying a $17.5 million SEC settlement, Super Micro began re-hiring top executives that were directly involved in the accounting scandal, per litigation records and interviews with former employees,\" it is said in the short report.\n\nFurther issues pointed out by Hindenburg Research involve Super Micro's relationships with related parties.\n\nSuper Micro CEO Charles Liang's brothers reportedly control suppliers Ablecom and Compuware, which have been paid $983 million over three years. These relationships, described as circular, involve transactions that are not fully disclosed and pose risks to revenue recognition and reported margins, according to Hindenburg.\n\nSuper Micro's integrity was also questioned in its dealings with sanctioned countries. Despite a guilty plea for exporting banned components to Iran in 2006 and assurances of compliance with U.S. export bans to Russia following the Ukraine invasion, the report suggests exports to Russia have increased, potentially violating sanctions.\n\nThe report also cites competition and quality issues leading to the loss of key customers. Major companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), CoreWeave, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have reduced their reliance on Super Micro, opting for competitors like Dell (NYSE:DELL).\n\nCustomer service and product reliability issues have further tarnished the company's reputation, with some clients reportedly experiencing high malfunction rates and service problems.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI) stock slides after short seller Hindenburg attack\n\nBank of Montreal warns of loss provision pressures after profit miss, shares fall\n\nLumen Technologies stock falls as Kerrisdale Capital releases short report\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 AI Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 68% and 218%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Investing in AI (artificial intelligence) stocks has gained momentum over the past few years. With businesses across industries increasingly adopting AI technologies to improve productivity, cost efficiency, and informed decision-making, AI will continue to be a major investment theme over the coming years.\n\nYet, not all businesses investing in, or deploying, artificial intelligence-based technologies have equal prospects ahead. Companies at the forefront of advanced data storage, data analytics, deploying AI-based platforms, cybersecurity, and machine learning technologies are better suited to demonstrate significant growth in the future. Not surprisingly, shares of these companies could generate robust returns for long-term investors.\n\nTwo such stocks that could fit this bill according to Wall Street analysts are CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Let's delve deeper and see what analysts see in these two ompanies for long-term success, which should be rewarding for investors.\n\nCrowdStrike\n\nOnce a darling of the stock market, cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike seems to have fallen out of favour after a faulty software update triggered a massive global IT outage on July 18, 2024. Although CrowdStrike rectified the error overnight, the failure of multiple mission-critical systems worldwide seems to have affected overall investor sentiment.\n\nDespite the public faux pas, Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron has maintained a \"Buy\" rating for the stock and set a target price of $450--implying an upside potential of 69% from Monday's close. Many analysts continue to be bullish about the company, with the average stock price target being $337, implying a 27% upside.\n\nWedbush Securities has estimated that less than 5% of the company's clients may switch top competitors--which amounts to around $150 million topline impact in fiscal 2025. Although the reputational blow may negatively affect business activity in the short to mid-term, the long-term impact may be minimal. This can be mainly attributed to the company's strong gross retention rates (a measure of customer stickiness) of over 98% before the incident.\n\nCrowdStrike's multi-modular AI-powered Falcon platform acts as a one-stop-shop for clients' cybersecurity needs, such as endpoint security, identity protection, cloud security, observability, threat intelligence, and data security. Falcon platform is scalable and easily deployable, characteristics that have made it deeply entrenched in their client's daily business operations. Furthermore, Falcon is also benefiting from network effects--since increasing adoption of more modules helps secure more threat data to enrich the AI-powered Threat Graph. This is helping in better training of the Falcon platform. All these aspects have resulted in high switching costs for CrowdStrike's customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company will release its second quarter fiscal 2025 results (ending July 31) today after the US market close, and investors will be closely tuning in to glean more insights about the actual severity of the impact of the software and process update failure on the company's client base and financials. The stock is currently trading at nearly 20 times trailing twelve-month (TTM) sales, far lower than its historical 5-year average PS ratio of nearly 30x. Hence, considering the company's robust fundamentals and reasonable valuation, this seems to be a good entry opportunity for astute, risk-tolerant investors.\n\nNvidia\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia is also set to report its second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings (ending July 28) today after US markets close. The stock has already gained nearly 155% so far in 2024, and is expected to rally even further in the coming quarters.\n\nOne of the most bullish estimates for Nvidia's share prices is from Beth Kindig, CEO and Lead technology analyst at the I/O Fund, who has predicted the company's market capitalization to reach $10 trillion by 2030 or even sooner--implying an upside potential of almost 218%. The analyst expects the company's full-stack AI platform, accelerated product roadmap, and the solid moat created by the company's CUDA software ecosystem to be major drivers for its stock.\n\nNvidia is seeing an explosion in demand for its AI chips and systems. Consumer internet companies, cloud providers, and enterprises across industries and geographies are increasingly using Nvidia's AI chips, networking solutions, and AI-optimized software in data centers and generative AI applications.\n\nSubsequently, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's data center revenues soared by 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. Demand for the company's next-generation H200 and Blackwell architecture chips is expected to surpass demand till 2025. This implies that Nvidia will enjoy significant pricing power in the future months. The company is also exploring using liquid-cooling solutions for data centers, which can result in dramatic energy savings. Hence, with the global data center market estimated to be worth $416.10 billion in 2024, Nvidia seems well-positioned to benefit from this opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is also gearing up to expand its total addressable market. The company expects Sovereign AI (initiatives by various governments to develop domestic AI capabilities) to translate into high single-digit billions in revenues in 2024, a dramatic increase from nothing in the previous year. The company also expects autonomous driving initiatives to further drive demand rapidly for AI chips and systems in coming quarters.\n\nNvidia is trading at 39 times trailing-twelve-month sales, far more than its historical five-year average of around 24. Despite the expensive valuation, the company's AI technology leadership, robust financials, and expanding market opportunities make it an attractive pick now.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have experienced some gut-wrenching volatility this year, and that will likely continue. After soaring as much as 174%, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker plunged as much as 25% and now sits roughly 7% off its all-time high.\n\nThe company has a lot riding on the upcoming debut of its Blackwell processor, which promises to take AI to the next level. However, reports that the launch will be delayed have weighed on investor sentiment, holding the stock back.\n\nOne Wall Street veteran believes investors are missing the forest for the trees.\n\nLoop Capital says Nvidia is a buy\n\nOn Monday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah reiterated his buy rating and $175 price target on Nvidia stock, which represents potential gains for investors of 38% compared to Monday's closing price. The analyst believes that while Blackwell B200/GB200 AI chips may be delayed, production of the current Hopper AI chips continues to accelerate, achieving greater throughput. As such, the increasing availability of the current Hopper processors -- which are considered the gold standard -- will more than make up for any potential Blackwell delays.\n\nThe analyst has a point. Earlier this month, Nvidia addressed the reports, saying, \"As we've stated before, Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in [the second half of 2024]. Beyond that, we don't comment on rumors.\"\n\nThe rubber meets the road\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30), and investors will be watching the proceedings with keen interest. Management is guiding for revenue of $28 billion, an increase of 107% year over year. Wall Street is even more bullish, with analysts' consensus estimates of $28.6 billion.\n\nTo be clear, at 46 times expected earnings, there's a lot of growth baked into Nvidia's current stock price. Management's outlook and comments regarding the broader state of AI adoption will likely be far more critical than the release date of a specific chip. I agree that Nvidia stock remains a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nIt still makes a lot of sense to own momentum stock darling Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n“If you don’t own Nvidia, you are literally missing out on a revolution,” Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (watch video above; listen in here).\n\nGerber opined those not investing in Nvidia are comparable to people “not investing in Napoleon during the French Revolution.”\n\nGerber says his firm has owned Nvidia's stock for over a decade.\n\nInitially, Nvidia’s strong position in gaming chips was the draw. But as Nvidia has pivoted to autonomous car chips and powerful AI chips, Gerber has been gobbling up more shares of the Jensen Huang-led tech play.\n\n“It’s been the best investment we’ve ever made,” Gerber added.\n\nThe firm’s longtime bullishness appears to have paid off handsomely. Recently, shares have skyrocketed with plenty of upside.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged more than 2,900% in the past five years, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabs the leadership position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong results continued in its first fiscal quarter, with sales rising 18% year over year to $26 billion. Non-GAAP earnings boomed 461% from the prior year.\n\nWhen Nvidia reports its closely watched second quarter results on Wednesday afternoon, the Street is looking for more of the same. Revenue and earnings are expected to rise 113% and 156%, respectively.\n\nGerber isn’t alone in his optimism on Nvidia.\n\nIn a June visit to the Opening Bid podcast, EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson told Sozzi he believed the company could hit a $6 trillion market cap, nearly double its then-$3.25 trillion market cap.\n\nNvidia's current market cap stands at about $3.18 trillion.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia ahead of earnings.\n\nConcerns such as delays in next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture are potential short-term woes, said Hari in a note to clients.\n\n\"Overall, we expect management commentary coupled with supply chain data points over the coming weeks to lead to higher conviction as it pertains to Nvidia’s earnings power in calendar 2025,” wrote Hari in a note.\n\nHari noted that significant customers, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), have unveiled plans to increase capital spending, and Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are allocating capital expenditure growth toward AI and cloud products.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Intra-quarter data points continued to indicate a robust demand environment,” wrote Hari.\n\nThis past week, Nvidia's rival AMD (AMD) announced the $4.9 billion acquisition of server equipment maker ZT Systems. To Nvidia bulls, the deal underscored how much the company is outpacing a worthy competitor such as AMD, led by Lisa Su.\n\n“We’re long-term investors,” Gerber said. “I think Nvidia should be a core holding, with Microsoft, for sure.”\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia is set to beat previous results when it publishes earnings on Wednesday. For the quarter, the chipmaker is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.65 on revenue of $28.7bn (£21.7bn). That works out to a 139% jump in EPS and a 113% increase in revenue compared to the same period a year ago when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5bn.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. And it’s expected to continue to hold that lead as it begins rolling out its next-generation Blackwell line of chips.\n\nThe most anticipated results of the quarter will send ripple effects throughout the tech sector as investors look for signs that the AI trade will continue to dominate market conversations into the second half of the year.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as German economy weakens and UK shop prices fall\n\nNvidia stock is up more than 163% year to date and 60% in the last six months. Rival AMD’s (AMD) stock price is up 9% year to date and down some 14% over the last six months.\n\nNigel Green of deVere Group said: “The company has become the undisputed leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, a market segment that is poised to reshape industries across the globe. In a world increasingly dominated by AI-driven technologies, Nvidia stands head and shoulders above the competition.\n\n\"The company’s cutting-edge GPUs, particularly its Hopper architecture, are driving massive demand, and there is no clear competitor in sight that can match its performance.\n\n“The result? A stratospheric rise in Nvidia’s stock and market cap that has far outpaced broader market gains.”\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nMiner BHP is set to boost copper production after its mainstay iron ore business suffered from China’s economic slowdown.\n\nThe FTSE 100 (^FTSE) group said it expects Chinese steel demand to remain depressed in 2024.\n\nConsumption of iron ore has been hammered by a slowdown in China, where fewer buildings are being constructed, dampening demand for steelmaking iron ore. Almost two-thirds of BHP’s revenues come from iron ore, with under one-third coming from copper.\n\nBHP chief executive Mike Henry said: “In the near term, we expect volatility in global commodity markets, with China experiencing an uneven recovery among its end-use sectors. The effectiveness of recently announced pro‑growth policies will be an important contributor for the country to achieve its official 5% growth target.”\n\nRead more: What we know as Telegram CEO Pavel Durov arrested\n\nStory continues\n\nBHP’s revenue for the year ending in June rose 3% to $55.7bn, while underlying net profit grew 2% to $13.7bn.\n\nHowever, its total profit attributable to shareholders fell 39% after a $2.7bn write down in the value of its Australian nickel operations, and a $3.8bn charge related to a dam collapse in Brazil.\n\nThe firm also cut its full-year dividend by 14% to $1.46 to reflect higher investment in new projects.\n\nShares were 1.5% higher at the time of writing.\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nRyanair shares rose more than 6% on Tuesday after the airline's boss Michael O'Leary said fare decreases will be limited to 5%, reassuring investors who had feared steeper reductions in prices.\n\nLast month the biggest airline in Europe warned that fares could drop by more than 10% as it missed analyst estimates for sales. Shares in the airline plunged 15% last month on the back of the news.\n\nThe risk of what O'Leary at the time called an \"ugly scenario\" of double-digit falls in average fares \"looks like it has disappeared.\"\n\n\"While fares were kind of softening during April, May and June, that has levelled out,\" he said.\n\nAsked if Ryanair was still seeing price resistance when it tried to raise prices on last-minute fares, O'Leary said: \"It's not the same price resistance.\"\n\nBrent Crude oil (BZ=F)\n\nBrent oil prices were steady on Tuesday, stabilising after three consecutive sessions of gains that saw prices climb roughly 7%.\n\nCrude traded at about $81 a barrel after rising 7% in the sharpest three-day rally since April last year, while West Texas Intermediate was near $77.\n\n“These gains were fuelled by expectations of interest rate cuts in the US, which became the dominant market narrative after the Federal Reserve chairman signalled an easing off of the monetary policy brakes,\" said Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades.\n\n\"Jerome Powell hinted at a rate cut in September and left the door open for additional cuts before the year's end, bolstering the outlook for economic growth and, consequently, oil demand.”\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n“Meanwhile, in the Middle East, tensions remain high between Israel, Iran, and its proxies, raising the threat of an all-out war that could severely disrupt the global supply of crude.”\n\n\"Adding to supply concerns, the potential closure of oil fields in Libya could, if confirmed, remove more than a million barrels per day from an already tight market.”\n\n“Against this backdrop, with pressures mounting from both the supply and demand sides, there may be room for further gains in oil prices.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With Nvidia Corp. earnings just a day away and a heavy slate of US economic data scheduled for later in the week, there’s was little movement in markets on Tuesday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\nUS equity futures, Treasuries and the dollar were little changed. The stakes are high ahead of Nvidia, especially after an earnings season that showed disappointing results for other “Magnificent Seven” megacaps. The upcoming reports on US economic growth, prices, personal spending and jobs are adding to the wait-and-see mood.\n\nThe heft of Nvidia, which has the second-biggest weighting in the S&P 500 after Apple Inc., and its heady valuation mean that it’s susceptible to big swings that could reverberate widely. Pricing in the options market shows that traders see the potential for an almost 10% move in either direction after earnings, which would translate to roughly 160 points in the Nasdaq 100 Index, or a 0.8% move, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNvidia’s “numbers will be good but what matters is the guidance in order to understand if the demand is still healthy,” said Alberto Tocchio, a portfolio manager at Kairos Partners. “If we get bad news, the rotation will be ever stronger as the market is still very heavy on the mega-cap.”\n\nRead: What a September Cut Could Mean for the Economy and the Election\n\nAmong individual stocks in US premarket trading, Paramount Global fell after Seagram Co. heir Edgar Bronfman Jr. dropped out the acquisition contest for the CBS parent, with producer David Ellison’s Skydance Media set to become the new owner. Nvidia shares edged higher.\n\nInvestors hope the bull market will broaden out of big tech after fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled Friday the central bank will cut rates soon. Other policy makers echoed his dovish tone: Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said it’s appropriate to begin cutting rates, while her Richmond counterpart Thomas Barkin said he still saw upside risks for inflation, though he supported “dialing down” policy.\n\nEconomists see the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy — the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation — rising 0.2% in July for a second month. That would pull the three-month annualized rate of so-called core inflation down to 2.1%, a smidgen above the central bank’s 2% goal.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Of course, the central bank will emphasize that it has not yet made a decision and wrap that in the words ‘data dependent’,” said Volkmar Baur, a strategist at Commerzbank AG. “But 95 percent of what it needs to know for its September meeting should already be available.”\n\nMeanwhile, Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index erased an early advance, with declines for retailers offsetting gains for carmakers and miners. Trading volumes were low, with activity on most European benchmarks about three-quarters of the average level from the past 30 days.\n\nAssociated British Foods Plc declined as Deutsche Bank cut its rating on the stock to sell from hold. Ryanair Plc led gains in European airline and travel stocks after CEO Michael O’Leary said a softening in fares experienced between April and June has levelled out. Bunzl Plc shares soared after the distribution group raised its full-year profit guidance.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nUS Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday Nvidia earnings, Wednesday Fed’s Raphael Bostic and Christopher Waller speak, Wednesday Eurozone consumer confidence, Thursday US GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday Japan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday Eurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday US personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 7:05 a.m. New York time Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.1% Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were little changed The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed The MSCI World Index was little changed\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.1165 The British pound rose 0.2% to $1.3216 The Japanese yen fell 0.2% to 144.86 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 1.8% to $62,328.22 Ether fell 2.2% to $2,629.34\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 3.85% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 2.29% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced 10 basis points to 4.01%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6% to $76.94 a barrel Spot gold fell 0.3% to $2,510.03 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert and Tugce Ozsoy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat to marginally higher on Tuesday as investors held on to hopes for imminent policy easing, with highly anticipated results from Nvidia and crucial economic data expected later in the week.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq took a pause from previous week's rally on Monday as investors sold tech-related stocks and shifted their focus to the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia, whose chips are widely used in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nNvidia's shares that led a recent bull-market rally were up 0.5% premarket ahead of the company's results on Wednesday, which is likely to show that quarterly revenue more than doubled and even a slight miss could hurt shares.\n\nSome investors are concerned about the company's ability to meet lofty expectations and have questioned the pace of spending on AI by Nvidia's largest customers.\n\n\"Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday is by far the most important event in global equities,\" said Peter Garnry, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo.\n\n\"Given the underlying momentum in the AI industry and the results we have seen from other companies in the AI ecosystem, we lean in direction of Nvidia beating consensus and lifting guidance for fiscal Q3 surpassing estimates.\"\n\nOther chip stocks such as Broadcom rose 0.6% and Advanced Micro Devices added 0.4%, after the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index notched a more than 2.5% decline on Monday.\n\nAt 05:32 a.m., Dow E-minis were up 18 points, or 0.04%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 6.5 points, or 0.12%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 44.5 points, or 0.23%.\n\nOptimism about lower borrowing costs starting next month following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's explicit endorsement last week also buoyed sentiment.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow closed at a record high for the first time in more than a month in the previous session and the benchmark S&P 500 is about 0.8% from its own milestone.\n\nTraders are now betting on either a 25-basis point or a 50-basis point rate cut in September. Odds of the former stand at a higher 71.5%, while those of a 50-bps cut are at 28.5%, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool.\n\nThe next catalyst will be the July Personal Consumption Expenditure data on Friday, that could offer markets greater clarity on how the central bank's policy easing could pan out.\n\nMeanwhile, UBS Global Wealth Management raised the odds of a U.S. recession to 25% from 20%, citing revised estimates of job growth and the recent July labor report that showed softness in the factors determining workers' income.\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount Global slid 2.5% after media veteran Edgar Bronfman Jr withdrew from the race for the company, clearing the way for Skydance Media to take control of Shari Redstone's media empire.\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\n\nWall Street stocks are back just shy of new record highs, lapping up the likely start of Federal Reserve easing next month but wary of Wednesday's quarterly update from artificial intelligence behemoth Nvidia.\n\nThere were three main reasons cited for this month's early \"head fake\" for stocks - a return of jobs-related recession worries, a puncturing of the short-yen, short-volatility trade and creeping doubts about AI overspend and its ultimate promise.\n\nRecession fears have been doused to some extent by data seen since the July employment report and Fed chair Jerome Powell's clear indication on Friday that \"the time has come\" to ease back on policy rates.\n\nAnd the speculative yen 'carry trade' and excessively low volatility gauges have returned close to more normal levels.\n\nBut earnings from $3.1 trillion megacap Nvidia, the second most valuable U.S. stock, are now awaited with bated breath to see if the AI theme is still on track.\n\nNvidia, whose stock is up more than 150% this year, is expected to report more than a doubling of its second-quarter revenue but the bar is now so high to impress the market, there's some trepidation about guidance ahead.\n\nThe stock is valued at about 37 times its forward earnings, compared with an average of around 29 for the top six tech companies on the benchmark index that includes the chipmaker.\n\nResults from Dell and Salesforce this week also add to the tech picture.\n\nNvidia shares fell back about 2% on Monday in advance of its report, knocking back the main indexes in the process and stopping the S&P500 less than 0.3% from new records.\n\nBut it was up marginally ahead of Tuesday's bell - as were index futures.\n\nFacing a heavy week of Treasury debt sales, where some $183 billion of 2-, 5- and 7-year notes go under the hammer, Treasury yields have backed up slightly despite the Fed optimism. First out of the traps on Tuesday is $69 billion of two-year paper.\n\nStory continues\n\nIrking Treasury yields additionally has been a pop higher in world crude oil prices this week amid renewed tensions in the Middle East and outages in Libya, although U.S. crude gains have been modest and remain negative year-on-year.\n\nThe latest test of U.S. economic resilience comes with a readout later on consumer confidence for August, but Friday's release of the Fed-favored PCE inflation gauge probably marks the biggest macro data release of the week.\n\nThe dollar index recovered marginally from Monday's lowest level in more than year - in line with firmer Treasury yields.\n\nBut 100 basis points of Fed easing remains in futures prices to the end of the year - implying that markets think at least one of the Fed's three remaining 2024 meetings will deliver a 50bp cut.\n\nSan Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly on Monday said \"the time is upon us\" to cut interest rates, likely starting with a quarter-percentage point reduction in borrowing costs. Asked if there is anything that could derail a rate cut at the U.S. central bank's Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, Daly told Bloomberg TV that it \"would be hard to imagine at this point.\"\n\nThe yen slipped back too, however, helping Japan's Nikkei higher.\n\nChinese mainland stock markets fell back, with news of 100% Canadian tariffs weighing on shares of electric vehicle and steel makers and downbeat comments about domestic demand dragging on e-commerce shares. It was a more mixed picture in Hong Kong, with financials steadying the Hang Seng.\n\nEuropean stocks were higher, led by miners.\n\nBHP Group said it will focus on growing its copper business through existing and incoming projects after its failed attempt to buy Anglo American as it reported a better-than-expected 2% rise in annual underlying profit.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:\n\n* US August consumer confidence, June home prices, Richmond Fed Aug business surveys, Dallas Fed's Aug service sector survey\n\n* US Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia in 3 Years",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming demand for anything related to artificial intelligence (AI). The company's GPUs are valuable equipment used to train large language models, which provide the backbone for generative AI. Big tech companies and cloud providers are snatching up as many Nvidia chips as they can get their hands on.\n\nThe results have been nothing short of phenomenal for Nvidia. Over the last two years, Nvidia has seen its market cap climb from about $424 billion to $3.1 trillion. It's currently sitting right above Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world behind only Apple.\n\nWhile Nvidia gets a lot of attention, it's important to remember it's not the only AI stock you can invest in. There are dozens of other great companies participating in the growth of AI. And the long-term prospects for some of them are even better than Nvidia's. That's why I predict these three companies could end up passing Nvidia's value over the next three years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is one of Nvidia's largest customers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently committed to accumulating 350,000 of the chipmaker's H100 GPUs by the end of this year. The company's capital expenditures, which management expects to come in between $37 billion and $40 billion this year, are rivaled only by the big public cloud companies like Microsoft and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And management expects Meta capex to keep climbing in 2025.\n\nThose massive investments won't pay off directly for some time, but Meta is positioned better than just about any other company to integrate AI capabilities into its products. It sees opportunities to improve the advertising business, grow its business messaging service (with custom AI chatbots), build the most popular consumer-facing AI assistant, and increase engagement across Facebook, Instagram, and its messaging apps.\n\nThat should lead to strong revenue and earnings growth over the long run, even with a step up in depreciation expenses from the increased investments in data centers. Importantly, the growth in spending will slow down over time, as Meta determines exactly how much data center capacity it needs for training and using its generative AI developments.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a forward PE around 26, which is reasonable for a company with its growth prospects. But Meta could outperform earnings estimates if its generative AI features increase ad prices and engagement on Facebook and Instagram and open the door for new revenue opportunities through business messaging and AI assistant interactions. With a market cap of about $1.35 trillion, it could find itself quickly growing to surpass Nvidia over the next three years if one of its AI efforts starts showing very good results.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), also known as TSMC, is the largest chip manufacturer in the world. When a company like Nvidia designs a new chip, it contracts with TSMC to produce that chip.\n\nTSMC's biggest advantage is its scale. It takes in over 60% of all spending on chip manufacturing. That gives it more money to reinvest in building its capabilities to produce faster, more powerful, and more power-efficient chips. With its cutting-edge design capabilities, it's able to maintain a dominant market share, since chip designers can't get the same results from anyone else.\n\nTSMC's relatively agnostic to who designs the chips. It can make an Nvidia chip just as easily as it can make a custom-designed chip from Meta, Microsoft, or Alphabet. And it does exactly that. That leaves it in a much less precarious position than Nvidia when it comes to the future of AI data center chips.\n\nMany of Nvidia's largest customers have their own chip designs specifically for training and using large language models. These chips aren't as flexible in their usage as Nvidia's, but they're more power-efficient and less expensive to acquire. That makes them increasingly valuable as companies like Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and others dial in and scale their AI development.\n\nIn the meantime, TSMC is able to benefit from the growing spend and increased competition for its limited resources. Its shares trade around 26 times forward earnings, but they arguably deserve a higher multiple as high demand and competition should benefit its bottom line and its earnings are much better protected on the downside. By comparison, Nvidia trades for a forward earnings multiple of 48. The true value for both companies is likely a multiple somewhere in the middle. If TSMC sees multiple expansions and Nvidia sees contraction, TSMC could surpass Nvidia's market cap over time.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is already the fourth-largest company in the world, but its market cap sits about $1 trillion behind Nvidia's. Still, there are good reasons to think the Google owner will increase in value faster than the chipmaker going forward.\n\nAt the core of Alphabet is Google Search. And while it's facing regulatory pressure, it's unlikely to lose the crown as the most popular search engine in the world. That ensures Google remains a key part of marketers' advertising budgets.\n\nImportantly, artificial intelligence assistants like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Meta AI aren't as big of threats as investors once feared. Google has used its own AI, based on its Gemini LLM, to provide direct answers to many search queries, linking to relevant sources. Management says its AI Overviews result in greater search usage and higher user satisfaction. It's also using AI to support new ways to search, including taking videos with your phone or circling content on an app or web page. Both should lead to increased usage.\n\nBut AI has the potential to significantly grow Google's cloud platform, which surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time last quarter. Google is winning many high-profile customers, including Apple, for its AI development platform on Google Cloud. Meanwhile, its Gemini for Workspace software is helping increase its average revenue per user and attract new customers.\n\nAlphabet is certainly spending heavily in order to win those customers. It expects to spend about $50 billion on capital expenditures this year, mainly investing in servers and data centers. But the payoff could be huge, as it invests ahead of the curve of demand for AI development. Google Cloud can become a much bigger part of the business, providing a nice complement to the Search business.\n\nWith shares trading at just 22 times forward earnings, there's room for multiple expansions. That's especially true if you consider the company's bottom line should sustain very high growth due to significant share buybacks supported by Alphabet's massive annual free cash flow. It's actually surprising investors don't value Alphabet higher than Nvidia already.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Stock-Split Stock Could Soar If Nvidia Delivers a Blowout Q2 Update",
        "content": "Which company is the center of attention this week? It's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), hands down. The chipmaker will announce its second-quarter earnings results following the market close on Wednesday.\n\nI fully expect Nvidia's numbers to delight investors again, enabling it to extend its already impressive gains this year. But there's another stock-split stock that could also soar if Nvidia delivers a blowout Q2 update.\n\nJoined at the hip\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, is arguably joined at the hip with Nvidia. The company provides server and storage solutions that are especially popular in data centers.\n\nThe same artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind fueling Nvidia's growth also helps Supermicro. Charles Liang, Supermicro's president and CEO, said earlier this month that his company \"continues to experience record demand of new AI infrastructures.\" As a result, Supermicro's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 soared 110% year over year.\n\nIf Nvidia handily beats expectations with its Q2 results on Wednesday (and, more importantly, if the company's guidance is strong), it will bode well for Supermicro's fortunes over the near term. I look for Nvidia to also provide some clarity on the timing of when chips based on its new Blackwell architecture will begin shipping. This should also help Supermicro, which has liquid-cooled AI superclusters ready to support Blackwell.\n\nSure, Liang maintains that a delay for Blackwell won't impact Supermicro much because it does business with other chipmakers. Make no mistake about it, though: Good news from Nvidia will translate to good news for Supermicro.\n\nWill Supermicro's stock split provide another catalyst?\n\nI don't think there's much doubt that a blow-out Nvidia Q2 update would provide a catalyst for Supermicro. But what about the company's 10-for-1 stock split scheduled for Oct. 1? It's iffy, in my view.\n\nFor one thing, Supermicro's stock split won't change anything at all about the company's underlying business or its growth prospects. On the other hand, spectacular guidance from Nvidia would likely mean stronger growth ahead for Supermicro.\n\nAny investor who really wanted to buy shares of Supermicro could do so even with its share price trading in the ballpark of $600. Many online brokerages support buying fractional shares.\n\nHowever, this will be Supermicro's first stock split. I'll admit that it's possible some investors who have remained on the sidelines could view the split as a great opportunity to buy the stock. I suspect the allure to invest in Supermicro could be even greater if the stock indeed soars as I expect it will following Nvidia's quarterly update this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Supermicro a better stock to buy than Nvidia?\n\nNow for an even more important question: Is Supermicro a better stock to buy than Nvidia? Wall Street seems to think so.\n\nThe consensus 12-month price target for Supermicro of analysts surveyed by LSEG in August reflects an upside potential of over 50%. By comparison, the average price target for Nvidia is slightly lower than its current price.\n\nI agree that Supermicro is a better pick than Nvidia. My primary reasoning is valuation. Supermicro's shares trade at a much lower forward earnings multiple than Nvidia's. But if Nvidia gives great news to investors on Wednesday, both of these stocks should be big winners.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Revenue and Net Income: This Is the Critical Metric to Look for When Nvidia Reports on Aug. 28",
        "content": "On Wall Street, important data releases are a common occurrence. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meetings, the monthly inflation and jobs reports, and even the quarterly filing of Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, provide invaluable data that investors can use to formulate an effective investment strategy.\n\nTomorrow (Aug. 28), the company that's played the biggest role in sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to record highs -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- will be lifting its proverbial hood and allowing Wall Street to examine its operating performance over the prior three months. This is, arguably, just as important of a data release as any that I mentioned above.\n\nAlthough investors are liable to be laser-focused on Nvidia's headline figures (revenue and net income), there's a considerably more important metric to look for that'll provide broader context on the health of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and Nvidia's future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow did Nvidia become Wall Street's most-awaited and important earnings report?\n\nBefore digging into this critical metric, it's imperative to provide background on how we got to this point. In other words, some explanation is needed for Nvidia's meteoric rise from a $360 billion market cap at the end of 2022 to a nearly $3.2 trillion valuation, as of the closing bell on Aug. 23, 2024.\n\nAs you may have rightly guessed, AI is behind this historic move. In short order, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) became the preferred choice in high-compute data centers. These chips are effectively the brains powering split-second decision-making, overseeing generative AI solutions, and helping to train large language models (LLMs).\n\nNvidia has also received an undeniable boost from its CUDA software platform. CUDA is the toolkit developers use to build LLMs and get the most out of their GPUs. CUDA is working seamlessly with the H100 to keep enterprise clients loyal to Nvidia's product and service ecosystem.\n\nThe other key piece of the puzzle for Nvidia is enterprise demand heavily outstripping the supply of its AI-GPUs. When demand for a good or service overwhelms supply, the price of that good or service usually increases until demand tapers. The cost for Nvidia's H100 typically comes in between $30,000 and $40,000, which is more than double the cost of the MI300X, which is a rival chip developed by Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nIt's this AI-GPU scarcity that you'll want to keep in mind when digging into Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter operating results, which are slated for release after the closing bell on Aug. 28.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget revenue and net income -- this metric trumps them both\n\nOver the five previous quarters (i.e., the entirety of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025), Nvidia has completely blown Wall Street's loftiest sales and profit expectations out of the water. With Wall Street analysts having a history of providing beatable consensus forecasts, it wouldn't be remotely shocking if Nvidia's revenue and net income sailed past expectations, once again.\n\nBut these two headline figures only tell part of the story. If you want a more complete picture of Nvidia's health and that of the AI revolution, focus on the company's gross margin. With Nvidia, I tend to hone in on its adjusted gross margin, which excludes factors like stock-based compensation and acquisition-based expenses.\n\nAlthough Nvidia has been selling more of its H100 GPUs, thanks in large part to a meaningful increase in chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity from world-leading chip-fabricator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the bulk of Nvidia's growth has come on the heels of its otherworldly GPU pricing power. Being able to charge 50% to 75% more than competing AI-GPUs propelled Nvidia's adjusted gross margin from 64.63% to 78.35% in five quarters. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFollowing Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results (ended April 28), management called for an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter. This would imply a decline of between 235 and 335 basis points from the sequential quarter.\n\nWhile this might just represent management being conservative as cost of goods climb in lockstep with new orders, a meaningful decline in adjusted gross margin might also hint at a shift in the AI landscape.\n\nOnce again, everything has revolved around the idea that AI-driven GPUs are scarce and in high demand. If Nvidia's adjusted gross margin comes in toward the low-end of its previous forecast, or its outlook calls for a further retracement in gross margin, it would pretty clearly signal that competitive pressures are beginning to be felt.\n\nIn particular, reports emerged this month that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform would be delayed by at least three months due to design flaws and various supply chain constraints.\n\nDespite a healthy order backlog for its Blackwell chip, there's the potential we might see businesses opt for cheaper AI-GPU alternatives that they can get their hands on quicker. First-mover advantages in the AI space are a thing, and some businesses aren't going to want to wait months on end for orders to be fulfilled. This opens the door for Advanced Micro Devices, Samsung, and other hardware developers to steal valuable space in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nAdjusted gross margin can also tell us if Nvidia is contending with internal competitive pressures. The company's four-largest customers, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprise around 40% of Nvidia's net sales. However, all four of these industry leaders are internally developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. A lower adjusted gross margin forecast may be reflective of Nvidia losing valuable data center \"real estate\" to these in-house chips.\n\nInstead of honing in on Nvidia's sales and net income tomorrow, dig deeper and seek out the adjusted gross margin figure that'll give you a more complete picture of what the future holds for Nvidia and artificial intelligence.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia, Arm, or Broadcom: The Best AI Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually reshape most industries by either eliminating the need for human workers or boosting worker productivity. Analysts generally agree the transformation will happen in phases. They define and ennumerate those phases differently, but infrastructure companies are always the first to benefit.\n\nTraining machine learning models and running inference on AI applications is contingent upon powerful semiconductors and networking hardware. As a result, chipmakers Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) have already benefited from AI adoption. Year to date, Nvidia stock has surged 160%, Arm stock has increased 80%, and Broadcom stock has climbed 49%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has advanced 18%.\n\nHowever, Wall Street believes the leaderboard will look different over the next 12 months. Listed below are the median price targets (and implied upside) for all three stocks as of Aug. 25.\n\nNvidia: $144 per share (11% implied upside) Arm: $135 per share (1% implied downside) Broadcom: $196 per share (18% implied upside)\n\nWall Street actually sees downside where Arm stock is concerned. And while analysts expect the other two semiconductor stocks to produce positive returns, Broadcom's median price target implies more upside.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like scientific computing and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNvidia also has monetization opportunities beyond GPUs. The company recently introduced its first data center server chip, called Grace, and CEO Jensen Huang says it's ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line. Nvidia also sells InfiniBand and Ethernet networking platforms. That portion of its business recently achieved a revenue run rate exceeding $12 billion annually.\n\nFinally, Nvidia has further expanded its ability to monetize AI by delving into software and services. Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of subscription software that streamlines the development and deployment of AI applications. And DGX Cloud brings together Nvidia hardware and software to create an end-to-end AI-as-a-service offering. Collectively, Nvidia's software and services segment recently achieved a revenue run rate of $1 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects the company's non-GAAP earnings to grow at 39% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). Compared to that estimate, its current valuation of 71.7 times adjusted earnings lands somewhere between cheap and expensive.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nArm designs central processing unit (CPU) architectures and development tools, and licenses the intellectual property (IP) to customers. Included among its clientele are the five largest companies in the world. Arm IP is the foundation for Apple's Private Cloud Compute, Nvidia's Grace CPUs, Microsoft's Cobalt chips, Alphabet's Axion CPUs, and Amazon's Graviton processors.\n\nThat lineup is particularly interesting because those chips are being used in data centers, a market historically dominated by Intel and AMD. To elaborate, Arm chips have traditionally been limited to mobile devices because x86 processors from Intel and AMD have offered superior computational performance. Companies on both sides of the architectural divide have attempted to take market share from the others, but Arm has been more successful.\n\nThe company has defended its dominance in smartphones and other mobile devices, while gaining share in data centers by improving its chips' processing power, especially where AI is concerned. That means Arm is well positioned to monetize AI on two fronts: personal devices like Apple's iPhones and Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs, as well as infrastructure and platform services offered by public cloud providers like Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nThe only problem with Arm is valuation. Wall Street expects the company to grow adjusted earnings at 25% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends March 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 96 times adjusted earnings look outrageously expensive.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom provides IT solutions across two broad categories: infrastructure software and semiconductors. To elaborate, the company sells virtualization, mainframe, and cybersecurity software, which help businesses manage, optimize, and protect IT infrastructure. Of the three software verticals, virtualization is most central to the Broadcom growth narrative. Its subsidiary VMware is the leader in server virtualization, and the market is projected to grow at 18% annually through 2032.\n\nHowever, Broadcom's largest opportunities lie in semiconductor solutions because that segment will benefit from demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Broadcom is the market leader in data center networking chips, and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Argus analysts Jim Kelleher recently wrote, \"The business most being impacted by AI is networking, where Broadcom has long-established market leadership in the enterprise and cloud data center.\" But that could change in the years ahead.\n\nBroadcom is also the market leader in high-end ASICs, custom silicon built for specialized use cases like artificial intelligence. The company already designs AI accelerators for Google and Meta Platforms, and it recently won a third major customer. Broadcom announced the deal in March without naming the client, but Reuters identified the company as TikTok parent ByteDance .\n\nToday, custom AI accelerators account for less than 10% of AI processors because the market is dominated by GPUs (Nvidia GPUs to be precise). But Morgan Stanley analysts believe custom AI chips sales will increase more quickly than GPU sales during the next few years, such that ASICs account for up to 30% of AI chips by 2027. In that scenario, Broadcom would likely be the biggest winner because it controls 55% to 60% of the market, according to analysts.\n\nWall Street expects the company's earnings to grow at 24% annually through 2025. That makes the current valuation of 38 times earnings look reasonable. Now is a good time for patient investors to buy a small position in this semiconductor stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee\n\nOptimism over looming U.S. interest rate cuts have been tempered by nervousness over what economic data will show in the coming weeks, sky-high expectations from earnings of AI darling Nvidia and evolving tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThat has left markets on edge and taking a breather, with the yen hovering near three-week highs, the dollar steady but close to 13-month lows and Asian stocks down 0.42% on Tuesday after touching its highest in a month on Monday.\n\nOil prices eased after surging in the previous session due to supply concerns, while gold was hovering close to a record peak touched last week on safe haven flows.\n\nFutures indicate European stock markets are set for a subdued open as well, with London stocks returning from a holiday on Monday.\n\nInvestors await key economic data this week, including EU inflation on Friday, for signals on the policy path for the European Central Bank, which meets on Sept. 12, where traders have broadly priced in a 25 basis point rate cut.\n\nNvidia's earnings on Wednesday will set the tone for a potential AI rally and improved risk appetite now that markets are braced for rate cuts.\n\nAnything other than an eye-watering growth forecast will likely unnerve investor confidence, but until then, markets will be jittery and choppy. Focus will be on Europe's technology stocks, after the tech index slid 1% on Monday.\n\nAnother thing to watch for will be how European markets react to lacklustre earnings from Temu-owner PDD Holdings that underscored weak demand from Chinese consumers, wiping out $55 billion in market capitalisation.\n\nEuropean luxury companies have also been hit by reduced spending from Chinese consumers.\n\nThe U.S. personal consumption expenditure price index - the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation - is due on Friday and will be closely scrutinised especially after Fed Chair Jerome Powell all but confirmed a rate cut in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkets are only concerned about the size of the cut - will it be a 25 bp cut or a bigger 50 bp cut next month. Traders are pricing in 100 bps of easing for the rest of the year's three Fed meetings. Data will decide where the Fed heads.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:\n\nEconomic events: Germany detailed GDP data for Q2\n\n(By Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Asian equities are poised to come under pressure Tuesday after technology stocks dragged down Wall Street as traders repositioned ahead of Nvidia Corp.’s earnings later this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination Nazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message\n\nEquity futures fell in Japan and Hong Kong, while those for Australia were little changed. In the US, some of the world’s largest technology names pushed stocks lower after a rally that put the market on the brink of its all-time highs. Contracts for US shares edged lower in early Asian trading.\n\nA gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 1.2% on Monday. While more than half of the shares in the S&P 500 gained, the US equity benchmark edged lower — a consequence of weakness in the tech giants that dominate it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a record.\n\nInvestors continued to keep a close eye on US policymakers as markets monitored the extent to which the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates next month. Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said it’s appropriate to begin cutting rates, while her Richmond counterpart Thomas Barkin said he still saw upside risks for inflation, though he supported “dialing down” rates.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields rose two basis points to 3.82% on Monday, while the dollar strengthened.\n\n“Powell sealed the deal for a September cut at Jackson Hole — leaving intact our thesis for continued broadening/rotation,” said Ohsung Kwon at Bank of America Corp. “But don’t sleep on Nvidia earnings, a consistent driver of S&P returns and still a risk to markets if they disappoint.”\n\nUS inflation figures this week will reinforce that long-awaited interest-rate cuts are coming soon, while a reading on consumer spending is seen indicating that the central bank has been successful at keeping the expansion intact.\n\nEconomists see the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy — the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation — rising 0.2% in July for a second month. That would pull the three-month annualized rate of so-called core inflation down to 2.1%, a smidgen above the central bank’s 2% goal.\n\nIn Asia, China urged Canada to immediately correct the “wrong practices” of new tariffs against the Asian nation. Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Earnings\n\nThe market has been on a healthier track over the past few weeks, moving away from the overly strong reliance on a few big tech names that we saw in the first seven months this year, according to Mark Hackett at Nationwide. With that said, we are currently in what can best be described as a “market pause,” he noted.\n\n“September is historically the worst month on the calendar, so investors should expect some volatility, especially if key indicators like the PCE inflation data, Nvidia earnings, or upcoming payroll disappoint,” he said.\n\nExpectations heading into the giant chipmaker’s earnings on Wednesday are high, with analysts anticipating another strong consensus beat that could prompt the chipmaker to raise its profit guidance. Trading in the options market suggest investors see potential for a 9% move in either direction on the day following the report, Citigroup Inc.’s Vishal Vivek said last week.\n\n“Move over, Powell. It’s Jensen Huang’s turn to move markets,” said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise, referring to Nvidia’s chief. “In our view, Nvidia’s earnings report this week may actually have more impact on the overall market than Powell’s Jackson Hole speech last week.”\n\nIn commodities, oil edged lower early Tuesday, following gains on Monday as Libya’s eastern government said it will halt exports. Gold was little changed.\n\nKey events this week:\n\nChina industrial profits, Tuesday Germany GDP, Tuesday US Conference Board consumer confidence, Tuesday Nvidia earnings, Wednesday Fed’s Raphael Bostic and Christopher Waller speak, Wednesday Eurozone consumer confidence, Thurrsday US GDP, initial jobless claims, Thursday Fed’s Raphael Bostic speaks, Thursday Japan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, Friday Eurozone CPI, unemployment, Friday US personal income, spending, PCE; consumer sentiment, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nS&P 500 futures fell 0.2% as of 7:24 a.m. Tokyo time Hang Seng futures fell 0.6% Nikkei 225 futures fell 0.3% S&P/ASX 200 futures were little changed\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.1163 on Tuesday The Japanese yen was little changed at 144.46 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.1228 per dollar The Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6771\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 0.2% to $63,296.9 Ether was little changed at $2,691.97\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.3% to $77.16 a barrel Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

Steller growth is expected on the bottom line as well with Q2 EPS expected at $0.63 versus $0.27 per share a year ago (EPS of $2.70/10).\n\nNotably, Nvidia has surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters posting an average EPS surprise of 18.43% in its last four quarterly reports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBlackwell Update & Outlook\n\nWall Street will be looking for more updates on Nvidia’s Blackwell series chips which were delayed for three months due to design flaws and are now anticipated to launch during Q4. The Blackwell GPUs are expected to be the highest-performing AI chips on the market and should keep Nvidia ahead of AMD’s AMD MI300 chips while building on its current H200 series.\n\nThis may be critical to reconfirming Nvidia’s enticing outlook with total sales projected to climb 94% in its current fiscal 2025 to $118.1 billion compared to $60.92 billion in FY24. Plus, FY26 sales are expected to leap another 31% to $154.61 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEven better, annual earnings are slated to soar 107% in FY25 and are forecasted to rise another 26% in FY26 to $3.40 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMonitoring Nvidia’s Valuation\n\nTrading around $126, Nvidia’s stock is at a 48X forward earnings multiple which is a premium to the S&P 500’s 23.8X but near AMD’s 46.1X. Furthermore, NVDA trades well below its five-year high of 122.1X forward earnings and at a discount to the median of 55.6X during this period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAhead of its Q2 report, Nvidia’s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Nvidia's valuation has become more reasonable, reaching or exceeding Q2 expectations may be critical to more upside along with reconfirming the Q4 launch of its Blackwell series chips which will be crucial to continuing its robust growth.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Dow Hits Record High on Otherwise Uneventful Trading Day",
        "content": "Monday, August 26th, 2024\r\n\r\nIt was an overall lackluster day in today’s stock market, save for one key piece of news: the Dow index has closed at new all-time highs. At 41,240 — +65 points on the day, or +0.16% — the blue-chip 30 stocks have taken out highs posted mid-July.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq has sold off -152 points on the session, -0.85%. The S&P 500 today dipped -0.32% and the small-cap Russell 2000 grew a modest +0.08%. As I say, overall a lackluster day of trading.\n\nWhat’s Behind the Chip Stock Selloff?\n\nAhead of the fiscal Q3 earnings report from NVIDIA NVDA on Wednesday, market participants are cooling their jets somewhat on the semiconductor trade. This is not so much in expectation that NVIDIA may miss estimates — it’s got a current winning streak of six straight quarters. But at trading levels over +150% year to date, following +239% in calendar-year 2023, you might say NVIDIA has been priced for perfection, and is reasonably taking some profits off the table.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the NVIDIA-adjacent trade took a powder today. Super Micro Computer SMCI, for instance, dropped -8% in today’s session, though the stock remains +95% year to date. That said, it was up near $1200 per share back in mid-March and a smaller-cap play on NVIDIA’s business. Other chip stocks that sold today, like Micron MU, did so on weaker shipments expected in the near term.\n\nWhat’s the Next Market Catalyst?\n\nAside from Wednesday afternoon’s Q3 numbers for NVIDIA, the next big possibility for a market shakeup from our current vista is Friday morning’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for July. Expectations are for a flat-to-slightly-higher report month over month — and with a “2-handle” year over year, on both headline and core prints.\r\n\r\nAt +2.6% core PCE in June, it had already cut in half the +5.2% level we had seen in October of 2022. The forecast for Friday is for this to tick up to +2.7%, but even if it does, this doesn’t mean we need to fear inflation creeping back into these metrics. Since May of last year, we’ve seen nine months of core PCE move lower, four stay flat with the previous month, and only one ticking back up.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before August 28",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is all set to release its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28, and analysts expect another quarter of outstanding growth from the company.\n\nMore specifically, LSEG Data & Analytics is forecasting Nvidia's revenue to increase by 112% on a year-over-year basis to $28.6 billion. That's slightly higher than the midpoint of Nvidia's revenue guidance range of $28 billion for Q2. However, LSEG data indicates that Nvidia's adjusted gross margin may have dropped from fiscal Q1 due to the company's investments in ramping up production capacity.\n\nIf that's accurate, Nvidia's gross margin would fall below its guidance of 75.5% for fiscal Q2. Now, a slip by Nvidia in its quarterly performance or the accompanying guidance could send its shares tumbling. If that's indeed the case, it may be a good idea for savvy investors to buy this semiconductor bellwether.\n\nHowever, the possibility of Nvidia's results and guidance exceeding expectations cannot be ruled out. In this article, we will examine three reasons why investors should consider buying Nvidia stock before its upcoming results.\n\n1. An attractive valuation makes the stock worth buying right now\n\nNvidia's expensive valuation has been a cause for concern in recent months, which is not surprising considering the stunning surge the stock has enjoyed since the end of 2022. However, a closer look at the stock's multiples will make it clear that investors are getting a good deal on this high-flying chipmaker right before its earnings report.\n\nNvidia currently trades at 48 times forward earnings. For comparison, the U.S. technology sector currently has an average earnings multiple of 46. Meanwhile, the stock's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) provides an even better gauge of how attractively valued Nvidia is right now. That's because the PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric calculated by dividing a stock's trailing P/E ratio by the estimated earnings growth that it could deliver.\n\nA PEG ratio of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued. By that measure, Nvidia stock seems extremely undervalued with respect to the earnings growth that it is likely to deliver. NVDA PEG Ratio Chart\n\nAs such, Nvidia is still a solid bet for investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios right now, especially considering that there are indications that it could deliver better-than-expected results.\n\n2. These AI hardware companies indicate that Nvidia is poised to deliver solid results\n\nThe earnings season is about to end, which means that we can get a fair idea about the health of the AI hardware market based on results from other companies in this ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, Nvidia's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, saw its top line jump 33% year over year in the second quarter of 2024 (which coincided with two months of Nvidia's fiscal Q2). That was a significant jump from the 13% year-over-year jump in revenue that TSMC delivered in the first quarter of the year. It is also worth noting that TSMC's July revenue increased 45% year over year, outpacing the growth it has witnessed in the first two quarters of the year.\n\nTSMC has been working hard in recent months to increase its packaging capacity of advanced chips that are used to manufacture AI chips for Nvidia. So, the surge in TSMC's quarterly revenue growth provides strong evidence of robust growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings, especially because Nvidia is TSMC's second-largest customer.\n\nHowever, TSMC isn't the only AI hardware player that has seen a significant surge in revenue recently. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), which manufactures AI server solutions used for mounting chips from chipmakers such as Nvidia, reported 143% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 30).\n\nSupermicro attributed its phenomenal growth to the \"strong demand for next generation air-cooled and direct liquid-cooled (DLC) rack-scale AI GPU platforms.\" What's more, the midpoint of Supermicro's revenue guidance for the current quarter stands at $6.5 billion, which would be a 216% increase from the same quarter last year.\n\nAgain, this is an indication that Nvidia could be ramping up the production of its next-generation Blackwell chips, which the company had promised would arrive later in 2024. Nvidia, therefore, could not only deliver results that may outpace Wall Street's expectations, but its guidance could also turn out to be solid and help the stock sustain its stunning rally.\n\n3. Big tech's capex surge is good news for Nvidia investors\n\nTechnology titans such as Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have been ramping up their capital expenditures (capex) to bolster their AI infrastructure. For instance, Microsoft's fiscal 2024 capital spending rose 75% from the previous year to almost $56 billion. The company expects to raise its capex once again in the current fiscal year to spend money on building more AI services so that it can position itself for long-term growth.\n\nAlphabet, on the other hand, could end the year with capex of around $50 billion as it intends to keep pouring money into servers and data centers. That would be a major increase over last year's capex of $32 billion. Even Meta raised its 2024 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $37 billion to $40 billion, up from the prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. The social media giant's 2023 capex stood at $28 billion, and it expects its capital spending to continue rising into 2025.\n\nInvestors should note that all of these companies have been Nvidia's customers, purchasing the company's chips to train and deploy AI models. Even better, they are set to adopt the chipmaker's next-generation Blackwell processors as well, and Nvidia expects that the demand for these new chips will outpace supply well into 2025. This potential spending could carry the company for quarters and even years to come.\n\nIn all, there is enough evidence that the demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to remain healthy, allowing it to deliver results that could exceed consensus estimates and guide above expectations. If that happens, shares of Nvidia could get another shot in the arm, which is why it may be a good idea for long-term-minded investors to buy this AI stock before it potentially soars further after Aug. 28.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's How You Can Play NVIDIA's Earnings",
        "content": "NVIDIA NVDA, arguably the most important company in the world right now, is set to report its fiscal second-quarter 2025 results after the market’s close on August 28. The earnings could be the next big catalyst for the AI trade and the broader market.\n\nAnalysts are expecting $0.63 in EPS on $28.2 billion in revenues, up 133.3% and 109% year-over-year, respectively. For the past six quarters, the company has consistently beaten expectations on both the top and bottom lines, while also raising guidance.\n\nAnother Blowout Quarter for Data Center Revenue?\n\nThe King of AI is the biggest beneficiary of the massive spending by tech giants building out AI infrastructure. (MSFT), Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META, currently account for more than 40% of NVIDIA's revenues.\n\nThese giants spent over $100 billion combined in the first two quarters, and they’re not pulling back on spending anytime soon as the AI race heats up. A large part of this capital will be spent on AI infrastructure buildouts, including data centers powered by NVIDIA’s GPUs.\n\nDoes the Stock Look Expensive Now?\n\nNVIDIA's shares have risen more than 165% this year, following a nearly 240% increase in 2023. They have rebounded strongly over the past two weeks but are still down about 10% from their record high. However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, as earnings are growing faster than its share price.\n\nNVIDIA shares are currently trading at 48x forward earnings. Over the last five years, NVIDIA shares have traded as high as 106.3x forward estimates.\n\nCan NVDA’s AI Chip Dominance Continue?\n\nNVIDIA dominates the market for cutting-edge AI chips and is almost invincible in its field due to its CUDA software. Its advanced, full-stack accelerated computing platform ensures that it will not lose much market share in the next few years.\n\nAny rival would first need to develop best-in-class hardware, software, and networking technology, and then gain access to a large share of TSMC's TSM advanced manufacturing capabilities.\n\nNVDA Single Stock ETFs\n\nNVIDIA is a high-beta stock and could be particularly volatile around earnings. Any pullbacks could present attractive buying opportunities.\n\nNVIDIA’s meteoric surge has drawn some investors to single-stock ETFs that aim to double its daily return. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL has $5.9 billion in assets, and the T-Rex 2x Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX has gathered  $732 million.\n\nThese instruments can be effectively used as short-term tactical trading tools before or after earnings. However, investors should remember that these products should be used only by those who closely monitor their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo learn more, please watch the short video above.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia Earnings in Focus, Chips Stocks Chopping Around",
        "content": "There has been a lot of market drama during August. While the final unofficial month of summer is known for end-of-season getaways among Wall Street executives and traders, an early-month volatility surge and a slew of market-moving macro events have kept investors on edge. Lately, though, most indicators have come up roses. Sanguine reports include the S&P Global Services PMI, the last few Initial Jobless Claims reports and the upbeat July Retail Sales update from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nLast week, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report published by the BLS made headlines.[1] The previous week, analysts at Goldman Sachs put out a report suggesting that upwards of 1 million jobs could have been erased from payrolls over the April 2023 to March 2024 period.[2] Despite a delay in its issuance, the report's release last Wednesday was a bit subdued in terms of market reaction. Then the following Friday morning, Fed Chair Jay Powell took to the podium to give his annual address from the foothills of the Grand Tetons in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nNVIDIA back in the spotlight\n\nPowell's speech reaffirmed expectations for the start of Fed easing. With the minutes from the July Federal Open Market Committee gathering already out in the open, the bond market largely anticipated Powell's tone and broad guidance. Equities, particularly small caps, rallied, nevertheless. While much could depend on how PCE inflation verifies later this week and what the August employment report reveals, attention can be turned back to company-specific news this week such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stalwart reports its second-quarter report this Wednesday evening. The current consensus operating earnings per share figure stands at 63 cents, according to data from Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS). That would be a threefold increase from 21 cents of non-GAAP per-share earnings from the same quarter in 2023.[3]\n\nNvidia is important since it's widely viewed as a key barometer of the health of the artificial intelligence theme. For nearly two years now, AI has been a significant catalyst helping to push stocks higher. Corporate AI capex has been strong, one of many factors helping to boost overall S&P 500 EPS.[4] According to FactSet, U.S. large caps' earnings growth of 10.90% in the second quarter tracks as the highest since the final quarter of 2021. Comps turn tougher for the current quarter, however; analysts expect S&P 500 bottom-line growth of just 4.90%.[5] NVIDIA results and outlook could help lift the forecast, but a soft assessment of chip demand could lead to a more depressed outlook. So, Wednesday night could be crucial.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's not all good news for the tech darling\n\nAnd while the $3.10 trillion market cap I.T. company has beaten on the bottom line in each of the previous six quarters, this might not be a slam dunk of a guide.[6] Among a myriad of troubling headlines during the weekend of Aug. 3, there were reports that Nvidia's next-generation AI chips could be delayed.[7]\n\nIts Blackwell semiconductors were originally expected to be available this coming January, but concerns rose that they might not be ready until the following spring, according to The Wall Street Journal.[8] Nevertheless, the same report mentioned that demand for its current chips was reportedly strong. Shares of the mega-cap dropped from July 10, above $135 per share, to a low of near $90 on Aug. 5. The stock had recovered much of its mid-July to early August drawdown by late last week.\n\nIntel's woes\n\nZooming out, the chips industry has been undergoing changes throughout the year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year as the once-preeminent semiconductor company struggles to hold onto market share.[9] Back on the afternoon of Aug. 1, Intel posted second-quarter results, missing on both the top and bottom lines.[10]\n\nWhat's more, the Santa Clara, California-based company announced a plan to cut costs by slashing jobs and suspending its dividend.[11] The move comes as many global companies have raised dividends this year. Looking ahead, Intel is slated to present at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on Thursday.\n\n2024: A big year for dividend hikes Nvidia Earnings in Focus, Chips Stocks Chopping Around\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nSales update from Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nFinally, let's do some globe-trotting. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is now the largest publicly traded non-U.S. stock with a market cap of $790 billion.[12] It beat on earnings in mid-July, and shares have followed a similar path to that of Nvidia. Though Taiwan Semiconductor's next full earnings report isn't expected until late October (unconfirmed), tech investors may want to mark Tuesday, Sept. 10 on their calendars. That's when the chipmaker issues its monthly interim sales update, which could offer additional clues on the state of semiconductor demand.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAfter a deluge of macro data impacting expectations for when and by how much the initial rate cut may be, investors have Nvidia front and center this week. The company's dominating presence is seen in recent actions, just as Taiwan Semiconductor looks to continue its recent success.\n\n1 New data shows US job growth has been far weaker than initially reported, CNN, Alicia Wallace, August 21, 2024, https://www.cnn.com2 Fed Confronts Up to a Million US Jobs Vanishing in Revision, Bloomberg, Augusta Saraiva, August 20, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com3 NVDA, ORATS, August 22, 2024, https://dashboard.orats.com4 Breaking Down the Tech Giants' AI Spending Surge, The Wall Street Journal, Nate Rattner, August 3, 2024, https://www.wsj.com5 Earnings Insight, FactSet, John Butters, August 16, 2024, https://advantage.factset.com6 NVDA, ORATS, August 22, 2024, https://dashboard.orats.com7 Nvidia Reportedly Delays Launch of Next-Gen AI Chips Amid Design Flaw, HPC, Ali Azhar, August 11, 2024, https://www.hpcwire.com8 Nvidia Investors Grapple With Delay to Next Generation AI Chip, The Wall Street Journal, Tom Dotan, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com9 Dow Jones Industrials Average, Barchart, August 22, 2024, https://www.barchart.com10 Intel Reports Second-Quarter 2024 Financial Results, Intel, August 1, 2024, https://www.intc.com11 Intel to Cut Jobs and Suspend Dividend in Cost-Saving Push, The Wall Street Journal, Asa Fitch, August 1, 2024, https://www.wsj.com12 iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. ETF (Trades, Portfolio), iShares, August 21, 2024, https://www.ishares.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): ‘It’s The King’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Wants You to Check These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the Jim Cramer-approved stocks.\n\nJim Cramer noticed a strange pattern during the recent winning streak last week. According to Cramer, when a company reported earnings that were better than expected, its stock price would rise significantly. Even if the results were just a bit better than feared, the stock still went up. Conversely, if a company posted disappointing earnings, the market largely ignored it, believing it was just a temporary setback because the Fed might soon cut interest rates. This led to continued buying. However, this trend changed today as reality began to take hold.\n\n\"You see, we had a very odd pattern during the winning streak. It was a bit of Pangloss and a nip of Camelot. When a company reported a better-than-expected quarter, it was great. When a company reported a quarter that was just better than feared, the stock still rose. And when a company reported a bad quarter, we decided that it was the last bad quarter because the Fed was about to cut rates, so it was no big deal—buy anyway. In other words, companies could do no wrong, but not today. Today, we had a bit of a reckoning, a dose of reality.\"\n\nJim Cramer pointed out that Tuesday’s market drop was anticipated because the S&P had been rising for eight straight days, and a ninth day would have been unusual, something not seen since 2004. The day was challenging, with the Dow falling 62 points and the S&P dropping 2%, which felt like a bigger loss. This raises concerns about whether the market can continue to rise, especially since negative news finally led to a decline after a strong eight-day rally.\n\n\"We were due for today's modest pullback—the S&P had been up for eight straight days, and nine straight would have put us in rarefied territory. We haven't seen that kind of winning streak since 2004. Today’s session was rough, with the Dow off by 62 points and the S&P dipping 2%, like losing 33%. We have to wonder if the market still has the momentum to go higher because today we got bad news, and guess what—stocks actually went down. That didn’t happen much during the 8-day gain.\"\n\nJim Cramer observed that the market had been in a phase where strong performance drove stock prices up, and even poor results were overlooked because of the belief that the Fed would intervene. However, after seven days of gains, he suggested that this optimistic trend might be ending. The market has now reached a point where stocks no longer automatically benefit from positive bias.\n\n\"People had been reporting a perfect market scenario where good performance led to stock gains, and poor performance was cushioned by expectations that the Fed would step in to save the day. But after seven relentlessly positive days, we have to accept that stocks may no longer get the benefit of the doubt. We've reached a point where the market is sufficiently elevated, and we're back to business as usual—where the good stocks rise, and the bad ones fall. At these high levels, we can't just dismiss the bears with \"heads I win, tails you lose.\" There's a return to rationality, and rationality is the enemy of a market where everything rallies indiscriminately.\"\n\nCramer also mentioned that many investors are hoping for the Fed to step in during their meeting at Jackson Hole on Friday. If those expectations aren't met, there could be significant selling pressure, particularly on a summer Friday. He noted that Lowe's recently suffered because the market might be entering a phase where multiple rate cuts are necessary, but there's no clear indication that such cuts are on the way. Without them, the company may struggle to turn its business around quickly.\n\n\"It doesn’t help that many expect the Fed cavalry to show up on Friday when they head to Jackson Hole. If things don’t go as expected, there could be a lot of selling, especially since it's a summer Friday.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and selected ten stocks he talked about. We also included information on how hedge funds feel about each stock and ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that own them, from the fewest to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hegde Fund Investors: 179\n\nJim Cramer discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s dominant position in the market, comparing it to a king with the rest of the market's stocks as its pawns. He expressed concerns about the pressure on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), questioning whether it can maintain its leading role without experiencing significant setbacks. Cramer noted that, based on Larry Williams' analysis, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) might face a peak and subsequent decline in the near term.\n\nCramer highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s current chart suggests a peak might occur next week, potentially leading to a sell-off that could extend through mid to late October. He acknowledged that while he hopes Larry's prediction is wrong, the analysis provides a valid basis for considering a possible downturn, especially if NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s future outlook does not meet expectations.\n\n\"I almost feel like you can guess it—it's Nvidia. It's the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia's drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, \"Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There's too much pressure on Nvidia—can it sustain it? I don't want Nvidia to be Samson.\"\n\nTake a look at this daily chart of Nvidia, going back to February. By the way, Larry, who advised selling Nvidia just before it peaked in the spring, predicted the stock would rise again in late May. Larry and his video calls have closely tracked the stock’s short-term cycle in red, which has followed the share price surprisingly well.\n\nUnfortunately, the short-term cycle now projects that Nvidia should peak sometime next week, leading to a sell-off that may extend through mid to late October. Nvidia reports next week, and the long-term cycle indicates a bottom around the same time. Given that Larry sees Nvidia as the lynchpin of the market, it makes sense that the cycle forecast predicts a downturn for Nvidia, aligning with expectations for the S&P 500.\n\nYes, Nvidia is that influential. The chart interpreted by Larry Williams suggests that we might experience some pain as August ends, which could continue through mid to late October. I hope he's wrong this time, but it’s wise to consider his analysis seriously. For my money, there’s a good chance he could be right, especially if Nvidia's outlook isn't strong.\"\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) achieved revenue of $13.5 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year, and earnings per share (EPS) of $3.08, surpassing analysts' expectations by 10%. This solid performance highlights the company's effective growth strategy. A key driver of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s positive outlook is its leading role in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs, including the A100 and H100 series, are critical for AI training and inference, positioning NVIDIA as a major player in the AI industry. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center business, which generated $8.5 billion in Q2 2024, has grown significantly due to the rising demand for AI and machine learning technologies.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s market position is further strengthened by strategic partnerships with top tech companies such as\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:MSFT) and\n\nAlphabet Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:GOOG), boosting its market reach and growth opportunities. The acquisition of Mellanox Technologies also enhances its data center capabilities, setting up the company for continued expansion. With the global semiconductor market expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% through 2028, driven by AI and data center needs, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well-positioned to benefit from these trends.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer wants you to check out. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "BTC Rallies as Fed Signals Rate Cuts: NVDA, COIN, SQ to Gain",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) scaled upward recently after the Federal Reserve’s Chair Jerome Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium that “time has come” to trim interest rates soon.\n\nRate cuts, by the way, are bullish for cryptocurrencies like BTC, and stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and Block, Inc. SQ are well-poised to gain from the digital coins’ present upsurge.\n\nBTC Bull Run is Here\n\nDespite a rollercoaster ride, BTC has been able to lure investors repeatedly since its inception in 2009. It witnessed modest gains in 2012 but surged substantially in 2017, and the momentum carried into 2021.\n\nBTC’s meteoric rise, however, was disrupted in 2022, yet the flagship cryptocurrency bounced back in 2023 to end at $42,258. In 2024, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs fueled another rally, with BTC’s price climbing above $70,000 by March.\n\nBTC’s price, nevertheless, has been struggling to hold above its key support level of $58,000 in recent times as investors remained cautious ahead of the Fed’s monetary policy decision.\n\nThings improved as BTC’s price scaled upward in the last couple of trading sessions to trade around $64,000 following the Fed’s assurance that the time has come for an interest rate cut soon. BTC’s price has jumped 9.2% in the last seven trading days raising speculation of a forthcoming upswing.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart – Percentage Change (7d) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat’s Propelling BTC Price Higher?\n\nPowell recently said that time has arrived to cut interest rates as inflationary pressures have begun to subside. The minutes from the Fed’s latest policy meeting also indicated that an interest rate cut in September is highly likely.\n\nPer the CME FedWatch Tool, 61.5% of market participants expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September meeting, with many estimating at least two rate cuts this year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: CME Group\n\nLiquidity increases amid a lower interest rate scenario. Thus, spending on riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks typically rises. At the same time, a significant downward selling pressure on BTC has waned. After all, the German government has concluded BTC liquidations and Bitcoin whales have started to acquire additional BTC.\n\n3 Stocks to Make the Most of BTC’s Upward Trajectory\n\nWith the price of BTC set to scale northward, things are hunky dory for NVIDIA, Coinbase Global and Block, which can take advantage of the world’s numero uno cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum. These stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA has entered the cryptocurrency space by developing graphic processing units for mining cryptos like BTC.\n\nNvidia’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 106.9% and 26.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 93.9% and 30.9%, respectively (read more: The Better AI Stock to Buy Now: NVDA or SMCI).\n\nCoinbase Global\n\nCoinbase Global is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. BTC is traded in its crypto-trading platform.\n\nCoinbase Global’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year is 6,000% and 1,435.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current quarter and year is 93.1% and 84.8%, respectively.\n\nBlock\n\nDigital payment company Block generates revenues from products such as Cash App, where BTC is traded.\n\nBlock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 98.9% and 27%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.9% and 9.6%, respectively.\n\nShares of NVIDIA, Coinbase Global and Block have gained 176.2%, 186.8% and 17%, respectively, over the past year.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s upcoming earnings report represents an \"underpriced risk\" for the broader market, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nWhile recent market attention has been focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish tone at Jackson Hole and the potential for rate cuts, BofA warns that investors may be overlooking the impact that Nvidia's results could have on equity indices.\n\n\"Nvidia results have been a key driver of equity indices,\" BofA notes, emphasizing that any disappointment in the company's performance could have a significant ripple effect on the market.\n\nDespite the market's current optimism, BofA believes that investors are not adequately pricing in the potential downside risks associated with Nvidia's earnings.\n\nTo hedge against this risk, BofA suggests that \"S&P put spreads offer better protection than NVDA-based hedges,\" particularly because the S&P 500's vulnerability to shocks tends to cluster.\n\nThe firm points out that the entry point for these put spreads benefits from the \"fastest ever VIX retracement and steeper skew,\" making S&P options relatively cheaper compared to Nvidia options in past earnings seasons.\n\nBofA also highlights that the broader market is in the \"early innings of an AI arms race,\" with hyperscalers spending $52 billion in the second quarter alone, a 54% year-over-year increase.\n\nThis massive investment in AI underlines the importance of Nvidia's earnings, as the company is a major player in this space.\n\nWhile the Magnificent 7 tech giants have driven much of the S&P 500's growth, BofA observes that \"earnings are broadening out\" across other sectors, which could help cushion the market from any potential Nvidia-related shocks.\n\nHowever, the firm maintains that the risks surrounding Nvidia's earnings are still underappreciated by the market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings is an 'an underpriced risk' for markets: BofA\n\nKremlin says it has seen media reports on death of Reuters safety adviser in Ukraine\n\nIcahn Enterprises hit near 21-year low on share sale worth up to $400 million\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Good Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nAn Analysis of the Technology Industry\n\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\n\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.\n\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:\n\n“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”\n\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\n\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best technology stocks to buy for the long term. It was held by 179 hedge funds in Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $53.67 billion. Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder of the company with a position worth $18.35 billion.\n\nIt is renowned for designing and manufacturing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and hardware for powering artificial intelligence applications. The technologies manufactured by the company are used in gaming, automotive, and data centers.\n\nGPUs are the specialty of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and give the company a strategic edge over its competitors due to its variety of applications. Initially, GPUs were mainly used for powering gaming graphics, however, their use case has gone beyond that. Today, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs are being used to train AI models and have contributed greatly to its revenue.\n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the explosive growth of AI resulted in the company's revenue surging 262% year-over-year to reach $26 billion, well above the guidance of $24 billion. Revenue growth was boosted by exceptional Data Center performance, which grew 427% year-over-year to reach $22.6 billion.\n\nGross Margin was also up 13.8 base points year-over-year indicating robust profitability. Moreover, as a result, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted an impressive yearly net income gain of 628% during the quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains confident in continuing the growth trend and expects the next quarter's revenue to be $28 billion and gross margins at 74.8%. If you were to look at its past 5-year performance, you would find NVDA to be no less than exceptional. The company has grown its top line by 49%, and its bottom line by 67%, while maintaining strong liquidity by increasing its levered free cash flow by 84%.\n\nIt is trading at a premium to its sector but its earnings are expected to grow by 92% during the year to reach $0.71. 61 analysts have a strong Buy rating on NVDA, with their 12-month median price target of $142.5 presenting an upside of 15% from the current level.\n\nAoris International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia to report Q2 earnings Wednesday in major test for AI trade",
        "content": "AI juggernaut Nvidia (NVDA) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Nvidia’s announcement — the most anticipated results of the quarter — will send ripple effects throughout the tech sector as investors look for signs that the AI trade will continue to dominate market conversations into the second half of the year.\n\nNvidia stock is up more than 163% year to date and 60% in the last six months. Rival AMD’s (AMD) stock price is up 9% year to date and down some 14% over the last six months.\n\nIntel (INTC) shares have collapsed 57% since the start of the year and are down 53% over the last six months as the company continues to struggle amid its massive turnaround effort.\n\nFor the quarter, Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.65 on revenue of $28.7 billion. That works out to a 139% jump in EPS and a 113% increase in revenue compared to the same period a year ago when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.27 and revenue of $13.5 billion.\n\nNvidia is the world leader in AI chip design and software, controlling between 80% and 95% of the market, according to Reuters. And it’s expected to continue to hold that lead as it begins rolling out its next-generation Blackwell line of chips. Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, makes a point as keynote speaker at SIGGRAPH 2024 on July 29, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnd while The Information has reported about a potential delay in Blackwell shipments, analysts at firms including Goldman Sachs, KeyBanc, and Loop Capital don’t see that as much of a concern for Nvidia in the near term.\n\n“Our work suggests that while Blackwell is in fact delayed as we first wrote about on [Aug. 8], it could be more like 120 days vs 90 days ... although it may not matter much as [1)] Hopper yields from TSMC continue to improve and [2)] The amount of increased Hopper production through the fall may outweigh the amount of Blackwell forgone by the push out,” Loop Capital managing director Ananda Baruah said in an investor note.\n\nFor the quarter, Nvidia’s all-important data center business is expected to bring in $24 billion in revenue, a 142% increase from the $10.3 billion the segment saw in the same quarter last year. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to not only beat its Q2 expectations but raise its guidance for Q3, something that could be backed up by TSMC’s recent earnings beat. TSMC produces chips for Nvidia.\n\nThat jump in data center growth, however, is lower than the 426% in revenue growth last quarter and 408% in Q4 last year.\n\nThat growth is expected to slow further in Q3 when the company is expected to see data center revenue of $27.7 billion, a 91% year-over-year increase.\n\n\"We're thinking that Nvidia is going to do close to $30 billion in data center revenue in October. And so, you know … the law of large numbers [is] here,\" Stifel managing director Ruben Roy told Yahoo Finance on Monday. \"But we do think, again, that the profitability of the company will continue to grow.\"\n\nStory continues StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nNvidia’s rivals aren’t resting on their laurels, either. Last week, AMD announced it is acquiring ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. The move gives AMD more firepower to build out AI system servers, something that’s been a major catalyst for Nvidia’s own sales.\n\nAnd while it could provide AMD with a boost in sales, it doesn’t mean Nvidia will face any major threats to its reign as the AI king anytime soon.\n\n\"There are emerging competitors like AMD that are starting to take a little bit of market share,\" Roy said. \"But when you look at the overall infrastructure spend cycle … which we think is going to continue to increase, Nvidia appears to us as the best positioned to benefit from [spending].\"\n\nBeyond its AI revenue, Nvidia is also expected to report gaming revenue of $2.7 billion. Once Nvidia’s main revenue source, gaming has become a far smaller piece of Nvidia’s story. Still, the segment is far and away larger than Nvidia’s other businesses including professional visualization and automotive. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): A Good Undervalued Stock to Invest In Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 16 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other undervalued stocks.\n\nWith the US stock market touching record highs, mainly driven by significant contributions from big technology sectors, domestic and global investors continue to observe market dynamics to tap potential opportunities. Therefore, identifying undervalued stocks becomes important as they might provide substantial value amidst high valuations across sectors.\n\nConcentration of S&P 500\n\nCourtesy of “Magnificent 7” stocks that captured investor attention in 2024, the market cap concentration in the leading US equities is the highest in decades. Strategists at Goldman Sachs believe the 10 largest US stocks now constitute ~33% of the S&P 500 index’s market value. This is well above the ~27% share reached at the peak of the tech bubble which was seen in 2000.\n\nThe present concentration helped in driving a period of strong US market returns. The market saw an annualized total return of ~16% over the previous 5 years. This compares to the 30-year annual average of 10%. As per Goldman Sachs, the top 10 stocks made up for over a third of that gain. That being said, “today’s top stocks are trading at lower valuations than the largest stocks did at the peak of the tech bubble in 2000.”\n\nDespite healthy returns, investors are anxious regarding the extreme current degree of market concentration relative to the recent history.\n\nThere appear to be similarities between the current conditions today and the episodes in 1973 and 2000. The labor market seems to be in a decent state, and concentration has been rising along with robust equity market returns. In these episodes, the peak of equity market concentration also led to the peak of a bull market, and the US economy saw recessionary fears in the subsequent year.\n\nHowever, the 1964 experience reflects that an ongoing bull market might continue to move higher despite a decline in market concentration. After the market concentration peaked, stock prices and the US economy were resilient for an extended period.\n\nAre The US Stocks Overvalued or Undervalued?\n\nThe valuations of the largest stocks are well below the previous highs. As of now, the 10 largest stocks continue to trade at the collective forward P/E multiple of ~25x, well below the peak valuations seen in the largest stocks in 2000, 2020, and the middle of 2023.\n\nThe valuations are also lower based on the premium the largest stocks are trading at relative to the rest of the market. That is to say that the ~35% valuation premium today remains well below the 80% premium seen in the middle of 2023 and the 100% premium of 2000. Though the degree of market cap concentration is indeed higher today as compared to the peak touched in 2000, the largest stocks are trading at much lower multiples than during the technology bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur methodology\n\nWe used the Finviz screener to extract the list of 16 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy Now. We have shortlisted the stocks that are expected to report earnings growth this year and have a forward P/E multiple of less than ~21.66x (as the market trades at the forward multiple of ~21.66x). We ranked the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)\n\nForward P/E as of August 22: 18.35x\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nExpected EPS Growth this Year: 58.3%\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) designs, develops, manufactures, and sells server solutions based on modular and open-standard architecture. It provides servers, motherboards, chassis, and accessories.\n\nWith higher investments in AI infrastructure, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) continues to benefit from higher orders for memory and storage products. In 2Q 2024, the firm delivered year-on-year growth of 143% in sales to $5.3 billion.\n\nThe company was earlier included in the S&P 500 this year. As we know, to be included in this list, a company is required to have positive earnings for 4 consecutive quarters. The massive surge in the stock price was primarily backed by its partnership with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the placing of its AI chips in the servers. As a result of such industry trends, the stock gained over ~3000% in 5 years. Now, the company’s board has approved a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nIn the latest fiscal year, the company saw revenues of $14.9 billion, exhibiting a huge rise over its FY 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion. The company’s results were supported by strong demand for its AI servers. Moving forward, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) might post strong sales figure given that it plans to bring a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia online later this year. The company is also quite optimistic about the growing demand for DLC servers. The company believes it can help data center operators reduce energy costs by up to 40%. At the same time, it will also improve computing performance.\n\nAs a result, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) decided to quickly add more DLC server rack capacity. This should help the company achieve long-term gains.\n\nAnalysts at The Goldman Sachs Group gave the price target of $675.00 and provided a “Neutral” rating for the company on 8th August. As per Insider Monkey’s 2Q 2024 database, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) was part of 47 hedge funds’ portfolios, up from 35 in the preceding quarter.\n\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“The second largest contributor to the Portfolio’s relative performance was Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), a provider of high- performance, energy-efficient servers, which the Portfolio does not own. The stock declined notably in the quarter, providing a tailwind to relative performance. On a YTD basis, however, Super Micro is still our largest relative detractor, given its robust 1Q return.”\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 11th on our list of the most undervalued stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Crush Wall Street Expectations on Aug. 28 -- but There's a Catch for the AI Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been 2024's most influential stock. Rising artificial intelligence (AI) demand spurred enormous sales and earnings growth for the company, and the business momentum translated to incredible valuation gains.\n\nThe processing leader's share price is up 161% across this year's trading alone, and its incredible performance has been a bullish catalyst for the market at large and other individual players in the AI space. Now, Nvidia stock is on the verge of its next big test.\n\nAfter the market closes on Wednesday, Aug. 28, the company will publish results for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year (which ended July 28). Management will also host a conference call to give investors further insight into the business and its outlook.\n\nThe earnings release will likely be one of this year's most important stock market events, and anticipation on Wall Street is running high. There's plenty of speculation on whether Nvidia will beat earnings expectations, and I'm predicting that the AI giant will comfortably beat most targets. But buckle up, because this one could get wild.\n\nNvidia looks poised to crush sales and earnings targets\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter update, Nvidia management guided for roughly $28 billion in sales in the second quarter. If the company hits that target, it would mean delivering annual sales growth of 107%. Management also expects Nvidia's gross margin to grow to 74.8%. Those numbers are nothing to sneeze at.\n\nWall Street is even more optimistic, with the average analyst estimate calling for the AI frontrunner to deliver sales of $28.6 billion in the period. Thus far, the company has been building an impressive streak of performance beats. Take a look at the table below, which tracks Nvidia's revenue against Wall Street's expectations over the company's last four reported quarters.\n\nFiscal Quarter Wall Street Consensus Revenue Target Actual Revenue Percentage Beat Q2 2024 $11.22 billion $13.51 billion 20.4% Q3 2024 $16.18 billion $18.12 billion 12% Q4 2024 $20.62 billion $22.1 billion 7.2% Q1 2025 $24.65 billion $26.04 billion 5.6%\n\nData sources: Nvidia and CNBC.\n\nWith the company posting fantastic margins, sales beats have also meant that the company's earnings have crushed Wall Street's expectations. Across the last year, the company's quarterly non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings beat the midpoint Wall Street target by an average of 17.3%.\n\nTech industry capex is flashing signals\n\nThere's a very good chance that Nvidia will manage to beat its own targets and the average Wall Street estimates with its upcoming quarterly report. Here's why.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith its last quarterly report, Microsoft announced capital expenditures (capex) of $19 billion -- with nearly all of the spending going to improving the company's cloud and AI infrastructure. Capex was up 35% from the previous quarter, and management also announced that spending is poised to continue climbing over the next year. Microsoft is widely believed to be Nvidia's largest customer, and increased spending on AI infrastructure is a clear bullish indicator.\n\nThe software giant wasn't the only one to deliver encouraging capex news recently. Meta Platforms, another big Nvidia customer, also raised its capital-spending guidance range with the second-quarter results it published at the end of last month.\n\nIn general, the sentiment among many leading tech companies appears to be that it's better to invest heavily in artificial intelligence right now than to risk being left behind or playing catch-up with competitors. Along with promising capex data from technology giants, that bodes well for Nvidia -- and I think the company will beat top- and bottom-line expectations in Q2.\n\nBut there's a catch. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia stock needs more than strong Q2 results for a post-earnings surge\n\nWhile the average Wall Street target calls for Nvidia to report revenue of $28.6 billion for the second quarter, some analysts have set the target significantly higher. For example, HSBC expects the business to report $30 billion in revenue for the period.\n\nBeating the average Wall Street target is often enough to trigger bullish valuation momentum for a company, but that isn't always the case. Hot stocks in particular are often held to higher standards -- with investors looking for the business to deliver results that match or exceed elevated expectations. It's also worth noting that Wall Street analysts have gotten more accurate in modeling the company's performance over the last year of reporting, with Nvidia's quarterly sales beat going from 20.4% in last year's second quarter to 5.6% in this year's first quarter.\n\nEven if Nvidia manages to far exceed the average Wall Street targets, there are other catalysts that could lead to volatile trading after earnings. Investors will also have the company's guidance for the current quarter and future roadmap under the microscope, and reports have emerged that the AI leader may be delaying the release of its next-generation Blackwell processors. Depending on what Blackwell news Nvidia has to share, the stock could see big moves in either direction.\n\nSo even with signs that the AI luminary will deliver strong Q2 results, investors should understand the stage could be set for post-earnings valuation volatility. Rather than trying to time short-term buying and selling moves around what the company's share price will do soon after earnings, it makes more sense to approach an investment in Nvidia with the company's long-term outlook in mind. Things generally continue to look quite promising on that front.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here’s Why Billionaire Paul Singer Is Staying Away from Top AI Stocks Like Microsoft (MSFT)",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMSFT is a major part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which, according to Paul Singer, are in a bubble.\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares recently fell following its latest quarterly results which showed the company’s Cloud business growth was lower than expected. For the ongoing quarter, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expects revenue in the range of $63.8B and $64.8B, compared to the $65.07B estimate. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure revenue is expected to grow by 28% and 29% year over year.\n\nBut what about AI? While Microsoft does not mention specific AI numbers, analysts believe Copilot is already playing a key role in growth at several segments of the company. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office’s commercial customer sales soared to $48 billion, significantly up from last year’s 10% growth, likely driven by Copilot Pro subscriptions. Office for individual users also saw a boost, with sales reaching $6.2 billion, a 4% increase compared to last year’s 2% growth, indicating accelerating growth from Copilot integration. Dynamics ERP and CRM software sales hit $6.3 billion, up 19%, surpassing last year’s 16% growth. This uptick is likely due to customers switching to Dynamics for the Copilot integration in the Dynamics Contact Center platform, which provides automated customer service chatbots and significant cost reductions. Bing sales jumped 3% year over year as more users switched to the search engine from Google Search, thanks to AI features.\n\nWhile Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) expenses are expected to remain elevated, its investments are working and would bear fruit in the long term. The stock is down about 11% over the past month. It trades 26x next fiscal year’s earnings. MSFT could be an attractive buy on the dip for long-term investors.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The top absolute contributors were Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon. Microsoft was another top absolute contributor in the quarter, speaking to a growing appreciation for all the ways the company has an opportunity to monetize GenAI, be it in its Office suite or Azure cloud business. In the latter case, it contributed 7% to Azure’s revenue growth in the most recent quarter. We believe Microsoft remains a highly advantaged business with many secular tailwinds driving durable growth for the foreseeable future, even at its immense scale.”\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Reasons To Buy Nvidia Stock Before August 28",
        "content": "Did you know that just one company was responsible for more than 30% of the S&P 500's growth for the first half of this year? Take a wild guess at what company you think it is. Yes, indeed, it's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker is the tide rising all boats.\n\nIt makes sense. Nvidia's technology is driving the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, enabling a technological revolution that some believe could be as transformative as the internet itself. Its massively powerful chips are a hot commodity, and that's putting it lightly. With the rest of big tech lining up at its door to get their hands on Nvidia's latest iteration, the company more than tripled its year-over-year revenue for the last three quarters.\n\nNow, all eyes are on the company's next earnings report, to be released August 28. Expectations are high. So, with the release fast approaching, is it a good time to hop on board the Nvidia train? Here are three reasons the stock still looks strong.\n\n1. Capex from the rest of Silicon Valley is accelerating\n\nThere was some trepidation in tech as a whole when the latest round of earnings reports kicked off. Although the numbers generally showed positive growth, they fell short of what many investors hoped, with the notable exception of Meta posting monster revenue growth. A major concern was the growing capital expenditures (capex) from most of Silicon Valley, especially from companies like Alphabet and Microsoft that build and operate the gargantuan data centers largely responsible for the internet as we know it.\n\nThese cloud operators spent huge sums of money in the last few years upgrading their data centers to be capable of training and running generative AI systems, and their spending is not slowing down. There's an arms race happening in Silicon Valley and no one wants to be left behind. Look at the uptick in capex for Alphabet and Microsoft over the last three years. Notice the big jump right as AI took over the news cycle in 2023? GOOGL CAPEX To Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThis capex growth is only continuing and even accelerating. Alphabet spent around $32 billion on capex in 2023. It's on track to spend about $50 billion this year. This is great news for Nvidia, who is on the supplier's side of many of these infrastructure orders. Yes, not all of this revenue is flowing into Nvidia's coffers, but a sizable portion is. There will continue to be a need to upgrade and expand these data centers for some time, and Nvidia will be there to meet that need.\n\n2. Nvidia has a new revenue stream and it could be substantial\n\nThe hype around Nvidia's technology is almost entirely focused on its chips. Although this will continue to be the company's bread and butter, Nvidia is expanding its product offerings into a critical category: networking. In simple terms, data needs to travel. Traditionally, data centers used ethernet-based networks to handle this, but AI can create too much data too quickly for legacy systems to handle. There are other technologies that can be used instead of ethernet, but retrofitting data centers with this is extremely expensive.\n\nThat's where Spectrum-X comes in, Nvidia's new ethernet-based networking platform for AI. Single data ports can handle data speeds up to 800 gigabits per second with low latency, and they are still backward-compatible with slower Ethernet standards. This allows certain components to be upgraded without completely overhauling the data center's network infrastructure at once.\n\nNow, Spectrum-X is not the only solution like this on the market. Broadcom already has a similar offering, for example, but I think Nvidia is likely to gain significant market share here because its solution will \"play nice\" with Nivida chips. The components will be optimized to work at maximum capacity when used together. Nvidia is building an ecosystem that will reward clients for sticking with its products. This could easily be a multi-billion dollar revenue stream within a year or two.\n\n3. Nvidia announced delays in its latest chip, but I doubt it will move the needle\n\nNividia committed itself to updating its flagship AI chip every year. That's quite a tall order and leaves little room for error. The company already seems to have slipped up.\n\nAfter a flaw was discovered in its Blackwell AI accelerator chips, the company announced there would be a delay in rolling them out. I think this is unlikely to have any significant impact on the company's bottom line. Its Hopper chips, which the Blackwells are intended to replace, are capable of meeting the current needs of its hyperscaler customers. Their sales will probably make up for any potential loss from the delayed Blackwell rollout.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Second-Quarter Earnings?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) journey from a niche gaming hardware company to a $3.18 trillion tech behemoth offers a great example of the potential that comes with long-term investing. A $1,000 investment made a decade ago has grown to be worth $270,790. But as this stock's ongoing rally (largely driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) trend) gets long in the tooth, investors may want to pay closer attention to its results for clues about what the coming years may bring.\n\nWith each passing quarter, more investors are asking: Is Nvidia stock still a buy, or is it time to take profits before a disappointing earnings report pops a potential price bubble?\n\nLet's dig deeper.\n\nIt will get harder to impress the market\n\nDuring earnings season, retail investors often get confused when their stocks drop despite increasing revenue and profits. The price fluctuations are usually tied more to stock valuations tied to projected future performance, not current performance. So, if a company doesn't continuously exceed expectations, its shares can drop even after what would otherwise be considered good business results. This could become a major challenge for Nvidia as it seeks to one-up already spectacular results from prior year periods.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which is mostly associated with the calendar year 2023), Nvidia's revenue grew 101% year over year to $13.51 billion. That figure pales in comparison to analysts' expectation of $28.7 billion in revenue in Q2 of fiscal 2025. Meeting or exceeding these lofty market expectations will be the key for Nvidia to maintain its valuation of 40 times sales compared to the S&P 500 average of just under 3.\n\nCan margins stay this high?\n\nPart of the reason why Nvidia can justify such a high top-line valuation is its gross margins, which compare its products' sales prices to their direct production costs. Last quarter, this number stood at an eye-watering 78.4%, helped by industry-leading AI graphics processing units (GPUs) like the h100, which sell for around $25,000 per unit. For context, Microsoft has a lower gross margin of 70% despite primarily selling digital software-as-a-service instead of physical products.\n\nNvidia may be taking advantage of chip scarcity and its competitive advantages, such as its GPU-associated software platform CUDA (which programmers are more familiar with) to price gouge consumers. And investors should keep a close eye on gross margins in the second quarter and beyond.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo far, competition from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices hasn't led to notable margin pressure. But Nvidia's top supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturinghas floated the idea of raising its production prices to get a larger slice of the pie. Capitalism tends to erode excess margins, and Nvidia's windfall probably won't last forever.\n\nStory continues\n\nLook for signs of economic slowdown\n\nEarlier this month, higher-than-expected unemployment numbers set off alarm bells on Wall Street. And according to analysts at J.P. Morgan, the probability of a U.S. recession stands at 35% before the end of the year. Investors should look for signs of these trends in Nvidia's earnings.\n\nNvidia will be sensitive to changes in macroeconomic sentiment because its high-end AI GPUs are arguably \"luxury\" technology products that are not essential for the core operations of many of its clients. Consumer-facing large language models (LLMs) are generally not profitable, making them likely to be among the first segments cut if the economy weakens.\n\nWhile AI could become one of the most transformational tech megatrends in years, it bears an uncanny resemblance to the dot.com bubble in the early 2000s.The industry could quickly unravel if companies decide it is no longer worthwhile to invest so much in a largely unproven opportunity.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nIf the last two years of earnings are anything to go by, betting against Nvidia is typically a bad idea. The chipmaker has continuously proven its naysayers wrong with incredible results quarter after quarter. And the second quarter of fiscal 2025 might not be an exception.\n\nThat said, investors should also be aware that the risks of holding Nvidia are beginning to rise -- possibly more than the potential rewards. The company will face increasingly challenging comps as it seeks to outdo already fantastic earnings. And its unusually high margins may eventually come under pressure from suppliers and competition. The rising likelihood of a near-term recession is probably the biggest possible headwind. And it may be a good idea to take profits before the macroeconomic environment changes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nNVIDIA: The Path to $10 Trillion\n\nSemiconductor and AI leader Nvidia reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company’s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\n\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week’s earnings report and whether it’s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\n\nHow Did Nvidia Stock Get Here?\n\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia’s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\n\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia’s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock’s unprecedented rally.\n\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It’s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\n\nNvidia Earnings Estimates\n\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out, the expectations are equally impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn’t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven’t been upgraded recently.\n\nCan Nvidia Reach $10 trillion?\n\nIt isn’t just possible, it’s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\n\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\n\nShould Investors Buy Shares in Nvidia?\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company’s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\n\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company’s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "U.S. stocks climbed on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that interest rate cuts are on the horizon.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 462.30 points, or 1.14%, reaching 41,175.08. The Nasdaq Composite saw a 1.47% increase, closing at 17,877.79, while the S&P 500 gained 1.15%, ending the day at 5,634.61—just shy of the all-time highs reached last month.\n\nFriday’s performance also capped off a winning week for all three major indexes. The Dow advanced nearly 1.3%, the Nasdaq gained 1.4%, and the S&P 500 climbed 1.45%.\n\nThe markets received a boost Friday morning following Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he signaled potential reductions in interest rates. However, he stopped short of detailing the timing or scale of any future rate cuts.\n\nThis week, the durable goods report is set to be released on Monday, and the core PCE inflation report on Friday. This data comes ahead of a busy period after Labor Day.\n\nEconomists at JPMorgan, anticipate that the core PCE figure will show a 0.12% month-over-month increase. This projection, based on existing data from the CPI, PPI, and import price index, is expected to keep the year-over-year rate steady at 2.6% for the third consecutive month. However, on a three-month annualized basis, prices would be up only 1.6%.\n\n“Recent FOMC communication indicates the Fed’s focus has shifted toward labor market risks and that inflation is close enough to target to facilitate cutting rates starting in September,” economists said. “We also forecast the headline index rose 0.1%m/m.\"\n\nNvidia to release its much-anticipated earnings\n\nApart from the two reports related to the U.S. economy, much of investors’ focus this week will be directed at the upcoming Nvidia earnings.\n\nThe chipmaker, seen as the vanguard of the ongoing AI revolution, will report financial results for fiscal Q2 2025 after the market closes on Wednesday.\n\nThe market expects NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to report quarterly results ahead of consensus estimates, but the primary focus will likely be on the company’s guidance, as investors remain skeptical about the sustainability of AI adoption.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for any updates from management on potential delays in the launch of the next-generation Blackwell chip. According to supply chain checks, performance issues have led to a chip respin involving the Blackwell tile, resulting in a one-quarter delay.\n\nHowever, KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts recently said that this \"is not expected to have any impact to near-term results and guidance.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" they noted.\n\nOther companies that will report earnings this week are CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU), and MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB).\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nCiti: “The S&P 500 has now mostly round tripped the mid-July to early August drawdown and is hovering near our 5600 year-end target. With the index PE back to 23x trailing, we suggest a balanced risk/reward in the shorter term. Generally, Q2 results were a “beat and hold” as we expected. Q2 upside was balanced with some downside to 2H expectations.”\n\nDeutsche Bank: \"Inflows to equity funds ($20.4bn) rose to the highest in a month, stretching the current streak to an 18th straight week, with total inflows of almost $250bn over this period. These strong inflows are especially notable in a period of typically weak seasonality. In our reading, the risk appetite evident in equity inflows remains very strong, pointing to likely occasional pullbacks on late cycle concerns, and domestic or international political escalations, but also sharp buy-the-dip rallies.\"\n\nJefferies: \"Risky assets are back to highs after wobble in early August. The early August move was driven by positioning and technicals, hence was a fade. Market was very long equities towards end July and hence the reaction to weaker employment numbers was exaggerated. However, we are keeping our risk positions small for now while keeping a medium term bullish view.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWith the Fed ready start cutting rates, what's next for stocks?\n\nIs Intel gearing up for activist investor?

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other American stocks.\n\nWith August Ending, What Can We Expect From US Markets?\n\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\n\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\n\nHow Would a Potential Rate Cut Impact The Markets?\n\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor company well-known to anyone interested in the AI market. Many investors like this stock because, at present, returns are becoming increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech names, and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of them, making it a stock you just can't miss out on.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known to be a company experiencing rapid growth. In the second quarter alone, the company grew its quarterly revenues to $26 billion, representing a growth of 262% year-over-year. The main catalyst for this growth is the increasing demand for graphics processing units, which NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplies. The company is currently nearing a new product cycle, with Blackwell going into production in the third quarter, which only bears testament to this demand's existence. We thus consider NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to be among the top American stocks to buy now for any investor, because demand for its products only seems to be going up, resulting in growth continuing.\n\nIn the second quarter, 179 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with a total stake value of $53.7 billion.\n\nAoris Investment Management mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“If Information Technology was the dominant sector for the quarter, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is the largest supplier of microprocessors used for generative AI applications, was the dominant company. NVIDIA’s share price rose by a third in the quarter and has increased by 255% so far this year. Since the beginning of 2023, its market value has risen by 8.3x, or $4.3 trillion, making NVIDIA the third largest company in the world by this measure.\n\nAs a result of the unusually strong stock price performance from NVIDIA and a few other large companies, equity markets have become increasingly concentrated. You can see this in the chart below, which shows that on 30 June, 27% of the market value of the 500 largest US companies was attributable to just five companies, more than twice the average of the last 20 years.\n\nThe composition of the Aoris International Fund will always be very different to that of the broader equity market. There will be periods, such as the most recent quarter, where this contributes to our performance lagging that of our benchmark. When it comes to NVIDIA and other AI-centric companies, rapid growth is exciting, but it makes it difficult for us to judge what is normal. Our preference is to own established leading companies where we can make a more confident, evidence-based judgement about their growth and profitability.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 6th on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "All eyes are again turning to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) this week.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) chip superstar is set to report its results for fiscal 2025's second quarter (which ended July 28) after hours on Wednesday, Aug. 28. As with the last several quarterly reports, the results are highly anticipated.\n\nNvidia is getting a lot more attention these days because of its leadership role in the generative AI revolution. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT accelerated the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other more advanced components that many companies use to run complex AI models.\n\nThere's a lot of speculation around the upcoming earnings report as Nvidia's results are likely to heavily influence whether the stock market, driven by the AI boom, continues its upward swing or whether it pulls back on concerns about a potential AI bubble.\n\nIt's impossible to consistently predict a company's quarterly results or the market's reaction to them, but Nvidia stock watchers have one advantage: Most of its big tech peers have already reported second-quarter earnings and the CEOs of these companies provided commentary on the state of play in the emerging AI industry. For investors, there were some key insights that offer hints about Nvidia's performance in the second quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDemand for Nvidia products is alive and well\n\nWhile there were some concerns in the stock market that AI stocks could be entering a bubble, especially when shares of Nvidia and its peers fell sharply in July through early August, it's clear that there's still a shortage of Nvidia components as companies rapidly add and expand new data centers.\n\nSpeaking on Tesla's second-quarter earnings call on July 23, CEO Elon Musk not only paid Nvidia a high compliment but underscored the limited supply of its product, saying:\n\nI should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often to difficult to get the GPUs. I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get ... Nvidia GPUs and when we want them.\n\nThere's little doubt from Musk's statement that the supply/demand imbalance that has made prices for Nvidia hardware soar and its sales spike persisted through the second quarter.\n\nSimilarly, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his thoughts on the evolving AI market on the July 31 earnings call, saying, \"We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities, so we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support or core AI work, in content ranking and ads, as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhrases like \"having sufficient compute capacity\" and \"investing meaningfully in (AI) infrastructure\" essentially mean \"buying Nvidia components.\"\n\nMeta CFO Susan Li also made it clear that this trend would only continue to grow as she said, \"Our expectation, obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase our investments in AI infrastructure next year,\" which bodes well for Nvidia.\n\nZuckerberg elaborated on his thinking and that of many of his peers during a podcast interview with a Bloomberg reporter. He acknowledged that there was a risk of overspending on AI infrastructure, but added that the bigger risk was underinvesting, \"because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\"\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai echoed that sentiment, saying on the company's recent earnings call, \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\"\n\nIs Nvidia a buy before its earnings report?\n\nFor Nvidia investors, the statements above should offer some reassurance that business continued to boom in the fiscal second quarter as financial reports and statements from the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies indicated that spending on AI infrastructure continued to soar and tech giants like Meta Platforms expect it to continue to do so into next year.\n\nWhether Nvidia stock gains on its earnings report will depend on how its results compare to analyst estimates. Currently, the average Wall Street analyst expects revenue of $25.64 billion in the quarter, up 90% from the quarter a year ago, and calls for adjusted earnings per share to jump from $1.19 in fiscal 2024's Q2 to $2.45.\n\nThe CEO statements above aren't a guarantee that Nvidia will rise on its earnings report, but they do offer strong evidence that the AI chip titan has a bright future ahead of it as the big tech companies all intend to keep buying its product.\n\nThat's reason enough to buy Nvidia stock before earnings, regardless of how it moves on Thursday.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Q2 sales likely to double, even a slight miss may hurt shares",
        "content": "By Arsheeya Bajwa\n\n(Reuters) - Nvidia is likely to report on Wednesday that its second-quarter revenue more than doubled. But investors used to its blockbuster results will be expecting even more from the artificial intelligence chip giant.\n\nA beat or a miss on Wall Street expectations could either stoke or shatter an AI rally on Thursday, a day after Nvidia reports earnings for the May-July period.\n\nThe company's shares have surged more than 150% this year, adding $1.82 trillion to its market value and lifting the S&P 500 to new highs.\n\nThe stock is valued at about 37 times its forward earnings, compared with an average of around 29 for the top six tech companies on the benchmark index that includes the chipmaker.\n\nTech heavyweights, including Microsoft, which are spending heavily to build out their AI infrastructure, have been buying Nvidia's powerful graphic processing units that allow large amounts of computing quickly. These chips are difficult to replace in present-day datacenters, which has sharply boosted Nvidia's fortunes.\n\nNvidia is expected to have recorded a year-over-year jump of about 112% in second-quarter revenue to $28.68 billion, according to LSEG data as of Aug. 23.\n\nBut its adjusted gross margin likely dropped more than 3 percentage points to 75.8% from the first quarter, burdened by the cost of a production ramp-up to meet growing demand.\n\n\"They're not only a benchmark for chips, but they're also a benchmark for AI as a whole,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in big U.S. tech firms, including Nvidia.\n\n\"If Nvidia misses, (investors are) going to sell off every company in AI.\"\n\nSome investors are concerned about the company's ability to meet lofty expectations and have questioned the pace of spending on AI by Nvidia's largest customers.\n\nThese worries led to a 20% slump in Nvidia's stock through much of July and early August, though a recent recovery has left the stock just about 5% below its record high in June.\n\nThere may be more trouble brewing around potential production delays of Nvidia's next generation Blackwell AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang said in May the chips would ship in the second quarter, but analysts have flagged design hurdles that could push the timeline.\n\nThis means revenue growth might take a hit in the first half of next year, research group SemiAnalysis said. Margins could also get squeezed if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, a possibility that the Taiwanese firm hinted at recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is likely to forecast a 75% surge in third-quarter revenue to $31.69 billion, LSEG data showed, ending its five-quarter run of triple-digit growth and reflecting tough comparisons from a year ago when it surged about 206% to $18.12 billion.\n\nFor the past three quarters, Nvidia's growth exceeded 200%.\n\n\"We're reaching the law of large numbers here, once a company gets to a certain size, it just physically can't keep up the same growth,\" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.\n\nSome analysts said Nvidia could offset much of the hit from the delay in Blackwell chips by substituting those orders with its prior generation Hopper chips. The Hopper family of processors is not as powerful or lucrative as Blackwell, but it is sufficient for most AI-related applications.\n\nInvestors will also seek updates on AI processors for the China market, where sales of its most advanced chips are barred by the U.S. government.\n\nNvidia's China-focused processors, reportedly called H20 and less powerful than its best chips, could help the company gain business over the next few quarters in a major market where domestic champion Huawei has emerged as a competitor.\n\nThere are also mounting antitrust concerns about the company's practices. US regulators are probing whether Nvidia pressured cloud providers to buy multiple products, and if it is trying to bundle its networking equipment with their sought-after AI chips.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is due to report earnings this week and while an above-consensus print is expected, the spotlight will be on guidance “as investors remain skittish on AI adoption,” Evercore ISI strategists said in a note.\n\nNotably, only 5% of U.S. businesses currently utilize AI, according to Evercore. Moreover, hyperscale capital expenditures, which have been closely linked to semiconductor sales, are expected to slow down in the second half of 2024.\n\nAs AI continues to expand its influence across various sectors, periods of market weakness are seen as buying opportunities.\n\nSigns of AI making inroads into traditionally difficult-to-automate sectors, such as retail, are emerging, strategists said, highlighting Walmart’s use of GenAI to enhance productivity.\n\nEvercore said its Strategy team has updated its list of “AI Revolutionaries,” which includes companies that are showing increasing mentions of AI, improving earnings per share (EPS), and offering attractive relative valuations. Nvidia, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and State Street (NYSE:STT) are on the list. Small-cap stocks and companies with significant buyback exposure are also included.\n\nNvidia will report its second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025 after the market closes on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts on Wall Street anticipate the chipmaker’s revenue to increase to $28.84 billion, which would represent more than double the revenue from the same quarter last year, according to estimates from Visible Alpha.\n\nNet income is also expected to more than double from the previous year, reaching $14.95 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, reports of delays in Nvidia's Blackwell chip caused a decline in the company's shares, though Nvidia has assured that production is still scheduled to ramp up in the second half of the year as initially planned.\n\nSome analysts believe that investor concerns may be exaggerated, with minimal impact on customers.\n\nRaymond James analysts, who noted that the delay might have a \"modest\" impact and could even boost demand for existing chips, anticipate that \"management will downplay the speculated delays.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia expected to beat, guidance will be key: Evercore\n\nUS stock futures edge higher with rate cuts, Nvidia results in focus\n\nEarnings call: Banco Macro faces headwinds in 2Q 2024 but sees lending growth\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying Up These Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the biggest winner of the AI boom thus far, but not everyone thinks the good times will last.\n\nIn fact, hedge funds continued to reduce their exposure to the popular stock in the second quarter, continuing a trend from the first quarter. In the period, which included Nvidia's reaching an all-time high market cap in June after its stock split, 326 hedge funds trimmed their positions, according to Whale Wisdom, while 264 hedge funds increased their positions.\n\nWhile many of the hedge fund managers who cut their holdings in Nvidia still hold large stakes in the AI stock, their decisions to reduce their exposure to it shows they think that the stock's biggest gains may be behind it. Let's take a look at a two of the stocks that billionaire investors are buying to replace Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIt shouldn't be a big surprise to find Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on hedge funds' shopping lists. Not only is it the biggest holding in the stock portfolio of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, but it's also the most valuable company in the world and a longtime winner on the stock market.\n\nApple appeared to be lagging in the AI race, but the company changed that impression when it unveiled its new Apple Intelligence platform, which features AI tools like a writing assistant and image generation, and will soon be available on the most advanced iPhones. The move also underscores Apple's key advantage in AI -- its installed base of more than 2 billion devices, which allows it to put its software and services in front of a vast number of users.\n\nOne of the hedge funds that pared back its Nvidia holdings and bought Apple last quarter was GQG Partners, a boutique investment firm based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the second quarter, GQG sold nearly 58 million Nvidia shares and added 11.3 million shares of Apple. Nvidia remains GQG's biggest holding, but it sold more than 40% of its shares in the GPU maker. Its Apple stake is entirely new.\n\nKen Griffin's Citadel Advisors, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, also exchanged some Nvidia stock for Apple in the quarter. It added 2.6 million shares of Apple worth roughly $500 million in the quarter. At the same time, it sold 9.3 million shares of Nvidia, or roughly $1 billion worth, leaving it with just 2.4 million shares. Citadel has additional exposure to Nvidia through options.\n\n2. Lyft\n\nWhile Apple appears to be a logical choice for hedge fund investors looking to rotate out of Nvidia, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) is more surprising. Shares of the No. 2 ride-sharing company have fallen sharply since its 2019 IPO -- its early valuations were unsustainable, and the pandemic dealt its business a setback as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Lyft now looks primed for a comeback under a new management team that has scaled back spending on incentives and rolled out popular new options such as giving women riders and drivers the ability to match with other women. Revenue jumped 41% year over year to $1.44 billion in the second quarter, and it reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.\n\nBillionaire investors seem to be taking notice. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management added 7.5 million shares of Lyft in the first quarter, or roughly $100 million. Meanwhile, he dumped nearly all of his Nvidia stake, selling 3.7 million shares to leave the fund with just 690,000 shares of the AI stock.\n\nGriffin's Citadel also added to its stake in Lyft, buying 4.4 million shares of the ride-sharing stock in the quarter, or roughly $50 million.\n\nFor a company the size of Lyft -- its market cap is less than $5 billion -- that indicates a considerable amount of bullishness from the professional investing set. Combined, Tepper and Griffin own more than 3% of the stock.\n\nLyft is a much different company than Apple, but the buys by Griffin and Tepper, as well as the momentum in its turnaround efforts, should give retail investors confidence to buy the stock. There's a lot of upside potential here as its financials continue to improve.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Futures little changed with markets near records\n\nU.S. stock futures were little changed on Monday as markets hovered near record highs after the Federal Reserve gave a clear signal that the long-awaited start of rate cuts would come next month.\n\nBy 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT), the Dow futures contract and the S&P 500 futures were both flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.1%.\n\nMarkets are coming off a strong week with the S&P 500′s Friday close putting the benchmark index less than 1% away from its all time high reached in mid July.\n\nThe three main indexes rallied after Fed Chair Jerome Powell that \"the time has come\" to lower the Fed funds target rate, and \"the upside risks of inflation have diminished.\"\n\nThe remarks appeared to all but guarantee a rate cut at the Fed's September 18 meeting, which would be the first such cut in over four years.\n\n2. U.S. data\n\nThis week the data-dependent Fed will have a raft of economic indicators to consider ahead of its September rate decision, including the Commerce Department's revised second-quarter GDP and its broad-ranging Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which includes the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick, the PCE price index.\n\nFriday’s PCE data will be closely watched though recent remarks by Fed policymakers have indicated that the Fed’s focus has shifted toward labor market risks and that inflation is close enough to target to facilitate cutting rates starting next month.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes a report on durable goods orders later Monday along with the weekly report on initial jobless claims on Thursday.\n\n3. Nvidia earnings\n\nThe rally in U.S. markets will face a test when AI-darling Nvidia reports earnings after the close on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date gain. But the stunning, multi-year run and AI-mania have also drawn comparisons to the dot-com craze that imploded more than two decades ago.\n\nThe earnings report along with guidance on whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is historically a volatile time of the year.\n\nThe results come at the end of an earnings season during which investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Oil prices rise\n\nOil prices pushed higher on Monday amid concerns that any potential widening of the conflict in the Middle East could disrupt regional oil supplies, while the prospect of imminent U.S. rate cuts boosted the global economic and fuel demand outlook.\n\nBrent crude futures climbed 74 cents, or 0.9%, to $78.89 a barrel by 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT) while U.S. crude futures were at $75.62 a barrel, up 75 cents, or 1.0%.\n\nBoth oil benchmarks gained more than 2% on Friday as expectations for September rate cuts by the Fed solidified.\n\nBut oil prices still ended last week lower as a poor outlook for major economies weighed on fuel demand.\n\nOil traders also remain cautious over plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, or OPEC+, to raise output later this year.\n\n5. NASA snubs Boeing\n\nNASA announced Saturday that it’s too risky to bring two astronauts stranded aboard the International Space Station back home in Boeing’s faulty new capsule and they will now return home in a SpaceX craft in early-2025.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams were stranded aboard the ISS in June after Boeing’s Starliner capsule seemingly malfunctioned during a test flight. The flight was initially planned to last a minimum of nine days but was delayed indefinitely as the agency raced to identify what went wrong with the Starliner.\n\nNASA’s decision to proceed with SpaceX marks more trouble for Boeing (NYSE:BA), which was already facing heightened scrutiny over the safety standards of its commercial aircrafts.\n\nSpaceX has contract with NASA to supply cargo to the ISS, and has completed nine successful missions to and from the ISS, as of April 2024.\n\n--Reuters contributed reporting\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures little changed, rate cut hopes and Nvida earnings - what's moving markets\n\nAustralian employees now have the right to ignore work emails, calls after hours\n\nDid Powell just pour gasoline on stock market's fire?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar After Aug. 28 Because of These 3 Key Factors",
        "content": "Nvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA) steep sell-off has nearly run its course. The stock plunged 23.5% at one point, causing considerable angst for some investors. However, Nvidia has been on a roll in August, jumping almost 25%.\n\nThis momentum will end anytime soon, in my view. Instead, I predict that Nvidia stock will soar after Aug. 28. And I think the surge will be due to three key factors.\n\n1. Blowout Q2 numbers\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2025 first quarter, the company said it expected Q2 revenue of \"$28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\" Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG believe Nvidia sandbagged a little. Their average Q2 revenue estimate is $28.6 billion.\n\nI predict Nvidia will beat its own Q2 outlook and top Wall Street's expectations when it announces its results on Aug. 28. I also think this will flow down to the bottom line, with the company exceeding the average analysts' adjusted earnings estimate of $0.64 per share.\n\nWhy am I so optimistic? Both Nvidia and Wall Street have been too pessimistic about the demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nIn Nvidia's fiscal 2024 Q4 update, management projected fiscal 2025 Q1 revenue of $24 billion, again giving a \"plus or minus 2%\" caveat. The company's actual Q1 revenue was $26 billion -- 8.3% higher than its outlook. Nvidia beat the consensus Q1 earnings estimate by 9.8%. I won't be surprised if there are similar outcomes in the company's Q2 results.\n\n2. Stellar guidance\n\nOn a related note, I look for Nvidia to once again provide stellar guidance for the next quarter in its Q2 update. I'm even more confident about this prediction than I am that the company will deliver blowout Q2 numbers.\n\nFour reasons explain my boldness: Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. All of these huge Nvidia customers indicated in their latest quarterly updates that their capital expenditures will likely increase in the coming quarters to expand their artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\n\nOne comment especially stood out to me in the tech giants' recent earnings calls. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, \"[T]he risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.\" That should be music to the ears of Nvidia shareholders. And if Alphabet sees this risk of under-investing, you can bet that Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta do too.\n\n3. Clarity on the Blackwell launch\n\nPerhaps the darkest cloud hovering over Nvidia in recent weeks is the concern that the company's launch of its new Blackwell GPUs will be significantly delayed. Any pushback in shipping these new chips will mean Nvidia's revenue won't grow as quickly as originally expected.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think the biggest issue for investors here is the sheer uncertainty. Some could be afraid of a much more serious delay than has been speculated so far. But the cure for uncertainty is clarity, something I expect Nvidia will provide in its Q2 conference call.\n\nAm I predicting there won't be any delay in shipping Blackwell chips? No. However, I suspect that Nvidia will seek to calm concerns to the best of its ability (and probably hint a lot about the pent-up demand for the new architecture). Once investors digest the news (whatever it might be), they'll quickly adjust their expectations. Most importantly, any delay will only be temporary.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been the talk of Wall Street since 2023 began, the return of stock-split euphoria has given AI a run for its money in 2024.\n\nA stock split is a mechanism publicly traded companies can lean on to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. Its superficial in the sense that adjusting share price and share count by the same magnitude has no impact on market cap or a company's underlying operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSplits come in two forms, with one being substantially more popular than the other. Reverse-stock splits are geared toward increasing a company's share price. This is usually done to ensure it meets the continued minimum listing standards of a major stock exchange.\n\nOn the other hand, forward-stock splits reduce a company's share price. The purpose of a forward split is to make shares more nominally affordable for investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. Since forward splits are almost always announced from a position of operating strength, this is the type of split investors gravitate to.\n\nSince 2024 began, 13 time-tested businesses have announced or completed a stock split -- all but one of which is of the forward-split variety. While no splits have garnered more attention than AI darlings Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), there's another scorching-hot stock-split stock readying for its moment in the spotlight.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have been Wall Street's most-anticipated stock splits of 2024\n\nAccording to the analysts at PwC, artificial intelligence is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 through various consumption-side benefits and productivity improvements. With an addressable market this large, it's not surprising to see Wall Street fall head over heels for AI stocks.\n\nNvidia has been the runaway face of the AI revolution. Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's market cap has increased by $2.8 trillion, which is the fastest ascent we've ever witnessed from a market-leading business. This was the catalyst that compelled Nvidia's board to approve a 10-for-1 forward split.\n\nNvidia's astronomical gains are a function of its H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) being the undisputed top choice in AI-accelerated data centers. The analysts at semiconductor firm TechInsights note that Nvidia's GPUs accounted for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped in 2023 to data centers.\n\nWith overwhelming demand comes the exceptional pricing power that's sent the company's adjusted gross margin considerably higher. Nvidia's H100 sports a price tag ranging from $30,000 to $40,000, which is well above what its competitors are charging for their AI-GPUs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't overlook Nvidia's CUDA platform, either. This software kit that helps developers build large language models is working hand-in-hand with the company's hardware to keep customers within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom has been a key supplier of networking solutions. Last year, it introduced its Jericho3-AI fabric, which can connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers. The goal of Broadcom's solutions is to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing potential of GPUs in use.\n\nAlthough Broadcom's stock has moved up in a big way because of its AI networking solutions -- this sizable move led to its first-ever stock split, 10-for-1, following the close of trading on July 12 -- there's a lot more to this company than just solutions tied to artificial intelligence.\n\nFor example, Broadcom is a leader in developing wireless chips and solutions for next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies upgrading their wireless networks to support 5G download speeds have increased demand for the chips and accessories used in next-gen wireless devices.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Broadcom have had their moment in the sun, another perennial outperformer, which has nothing to do with AI and has gained more than 120,000%, including dividends paid, since its initial public offering (IPO), is ready to step forward and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis 120,000%-gainer is two weeks away from becoming Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nFollowing the close of trading on September 11, corporate uniform and business services provider Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS) will complete a 4-for-1 forward split and join the ranks of an elite group of outperforming stock-split stocks in 2024.\n\nThis marks the sixth time Cintas will have conducted a forward split since its IPO in August 1983:\n\nApril 1987: 2-for-1 April 1991: 3-for-2 April 1992: 2-for-1 November 1997: 2-for-1 March 2000: 3-for-2 September 2024: 4-for-1\n\nHow does a company that supplies corporate uniforms, floor mats, towels, and safety kits outperform Wall Street's benchmark indexes so decisively over a four-decade stretch? History and revenue diversity are the first important puzzle pieces.\n\nBased on the company's own admission in June, it has \"more than 1 million businesses of all types and sizes\" that it services. With no single customer accounting for an outsized percentage of sales, Cintas doesn't have to worry about its proverbial ship sinking because of the struggles of one or more of its customers.\n\nAdditionally, Cintas has history on its side. Although recessions are a perfectly normal aspect of the economic cycle, they're almost always short-lived. Periods of economic growth stick around significantly longer, thusly allowing Cintas's customers to expand. In turn, this increases demand for corporate uniforms and business services over time.\n\nAnother key to the company's long-term success has been its willingness to grow via acquisition. Since this century began, it's scooped up Omni Services (2002), Zee Medical (2015), and G&K Services (2017), to name a few. These earnings-accretive deals expand the company's product portfolio and work to keep existing clients within its network of products and services.\n\nDon't overlook innovation, either. Cintas has introduced new products to lure in new clients, and leaned on a variety of cross-selling solutions to encourage existing clients to spend more.\n\nThe cherry on top is the company's incredible capital-return program. It's raised its dividend every year since going public in 1983 and recently added to its share repurchase program, which stood at $1.5 billion, as of July 23, 2024. A company that can raise its payout for four decades without interruption is a business that's demonstrated it can navigate anything the U.S. economy throws its way.\n\nThe one downside with Cintas is its valuation. Though being an industry leader has its perks and comes with some degree of a valuation premium, a forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 43 for a company expected to grow its earnings per share by an annual average of 13% through 2028 is difficult to justify.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cintas right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cintas, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cintas wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Is What Will Finally End Nvidia's Monster Stock Gains",
        "content": "It's Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) world, investors are just living in it. At least, that's what it has felt like in 2023 and 2024. The chipmaker and leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure now has a market cap topping $3 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world. Up close to 3,000% in the last five years, it is now one of the best performing stocks ever, making longtime shareholders incredibly wealthy.\n\nI predict this monster run is close to over. No, it has nothing to do with the company's upcoming earnings release on Aug. 28. But it does have to do with a widening competitive set that could impact Nvidia's pricing power over the long term. Here's why I think Nvidia's monster stock gains are set to end within the next few years.\n\nCloud vertical integration\n\nNvidia's operating income is up more than 2,000% in the last five years to $48 billion. This growth has come because Nvidia chips are the premier computing vehicle for new AI tools taking over the technology sector. As the only scaled supplier of these premier chips and with a technological lead over competitors such as Intel, Nvidia has seen a surge in revenue and profit margins as it sells these scarce resources at sky-high prices.\n\nThree of its largest customers are Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft. These are the three big cloud-computing providers that are the infrastructure backbone for new AI algorithms and software. Combined, these three are likely spending over $10 billion a year, perhaps $20 billion, on Nvidia chips. Now, it looks like Nvidia has angered the cloud hornets nest.\n\nIn a move that is being underfollowed by Wall Street, these cloud providers have announced huge investments to make their own AI chips. For example, Amazon is now making its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium that directly compete with Nvidia. The products are behind Nvidia right now in computing capabilities, but with so much money spent on Nvidia chips, it makes sense for Amazon to pour billions of dollars into research and development to try and improve these offerings.\n\nGoogle has its own tensor processing units (TPUs), and Microsoft has announced its investments into internal chip development. They may take years to scale, but supply is only going to go up and create more competition for Nvidia, not less. Even worse, the competition is coming from Nvidia's own customers.\n\nCompetition eliminates pricing power\n\nA key for Nvidia's stock gains in the past two years has been operating-margin expansion. From a low at close to 15%, Nvidia's operating margin was around 60% over the past 12 months. This has actually contributed more to Nvidia's earnings growth than revenue. Revenue is up 228% in the last three years, while operating margin is up close to 4 times off of its lows.\n\nNvidia is able to have absurd profit margins because of the minimal current competition it faces for AI computer chips. This leads to pricing power, which accelerates revenue growth and expands margins -- a wonderful set of catalysts for a stock. However, this can reverse if competition increases, which is happening with the three largest cloud providers. If they keep replacing more and more of their Nvidia chips with their own brands, Nvidia's revenue and earnings growth will be impacted.\n\nTo be clear, the timeline on this competition is not in 2024. It may take multiple years for Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to make a dent in Nvidia's AI chip business. But the companies have a huge incentive to do so because of the price hikes Nvidia has implemented on them. All three of the big cloud providers have plenty of cash to spend in order to get these divisions to scale. And they are working on them. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nRisks for Nvidia stock\n\nNvidia stock has insane momentum right now. That is because earnings and revenue are growing at an insane rate. A growing supply of AI chips from competitors -- whether Amazon or anyone else -- could be a double-whammy headwind for Nvidia's financials.\n\nGrowing competition means increasing the supply of chips that cloud providers and other AI chip purchasers can buy. The simple law of supply and demand dictates that prices will come down if supply increases but demand remains the same. This would lead to a revenue slowdown and a margin decrease, which both negatively affect Nvidia's earnings power.\n\nToday, Nvidia trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 73, which is close to triple the S&P 500 index average. And this is based on trailing earnings with sky-high 60% profit margins. If pricing power comes down, it will impact revenue and profit margins. From a numbers basis, this means even if Nvidia sells more computer chips in the coming years, profits could actually be significantly lower.\n\nStocks with declining earnings don't trade at a P/E of 73. And don't forget that this P/E would climb to more than 100 compared to its current market cap of $3 trillion if profit margins decline to \"just\" 40%. This makes Nvidia stock incredibly risky, which is why I predict its monster stock run is coming to a close. It is still a quality business but not one that deserves to trade at a market cap of $3 trillion right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is atop the throne as the largest company in the world. It leads second-place Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by $280 billion, but I don't think it will maintain its leadership position.\n\nIn the next five years, I think multiple companies will overtake Apple, but two picks are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). These two have a strong case for becoming larger than Apple, but it won't happen overnight.\n\nWhy am I bearish on Apple?\n\nFirst off, let's talk about Apple. In my opinion, Apple is trading so high due to its past performance. If you look at the performance without the name attached, Apple isn't currently that great of an investment. If I approached you with a stock that posted shrinking revenue for five of the last seven quarters, and in the two quarters it delivered growth, the best growth rate was 5%, you'd probably pass. Throw in the fact that this company is trading at 34 times forward earnings, and you'd run for the hills.\n\nBut, because Apple is Apple, investors give it a pass. This won't go on forever, and eventually, something will give. This opens up a lane for Alphabet and Amazon to surpass it, as they still have multiple growth catalysts ahead of them.\n\nCloud computing is a huge part of Amazon's and Alphabet's investment thesis\n\nWhile many think of Amazon as just an e-commerce channel, it's much more than that. Commerce businesses have notoriously low margins, so Amazon has multiple other divisions that help boost its profits. One of the fastest growing is its advertising services, which has been on fire over the past few years.\n\nAnother strong segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing offering. AWS is the largest cloud computing business by market share but has recently delivered slightly less growth than its competition. However, AWS' growth has reaccelerated, which is a huge selling point for the stock.\n\nAlthough AWS makes up 18% of Amazon's revenue, it accounted for 64% of its operating profit in the second quarter. Though Amazon's business is much broader than cloud computing, its cloud services are a massive part of the Amazon investment thesis. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion in 2029, it has a huge demand wave pushing it.\n\nAn investment in Alphabet is also an investment in its advertising business. With ad revenue making up around three-fourths of total revenue, it's a huge part of its business. Many are worried its search engine dominance may come to an end with competitors like OpenAI entering the arena. However, I think these concerns are overblown, as it would require billions of people to change their habits very quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don't see that happening anytime soon, so I'm not concerned about some of the increased competition.\n\nAnother bonus for Alphabet is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. While Google Cloud isn't as big as AWS, it's still a big part of the growth story, as cloud computing is in huge demand thanks to the AI arms race.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet have their primary businesses, but their cloud computing wings are huge reasons to consider buying the stocks. Apple doesn't have the same kind of growth catalysts pushing it, so don't be surprised if either of these two passes up Apple within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Sunday, cooling after a rally on Wall Street as comments from Federal Reserve officials cemented expectations for a September interest rate cut.\n\nBut caution kicked in before a string of key signals this week, most importantly being earnings from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which are due after the bell on Wednesday. PCE price index data- the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge- is also due later in the week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.2% to 5,643.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 19,745.0 points by 19:45 ET (23:45 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell slightly to 41,251.0 points.\n\nNvidia earnings on tap as AI rally falters\n\nNvidia is set to report its earnings for the three months to July on Wednesday, with focus squarely on whether the firm was able to maintain its pace of stellar earnings growth on a boost from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe chipmaker’s earnings and outlook are also set to offer more cues on the state of AI demand, and come after a slew of mixed earnings from other technology heavyweights raised questions over just how much of an AI-fuelled market rally over the past year was justified. Majors such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had fallen after their second-quarter earnings reports.\n\nNvidia, which makes the most advanced AI chips in the market, was a key benefactor of increased interest in AI, more than doubling in value and becoming one of the most valuable companies on Wall Street in the past year.\n\nBut this trend will be tested on Wednesday. Earnings from other chipmaking titans such as TSMC (NYSE:TSM) and ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), released in July, showed that at least chipmakers appeared to be still benefiting from AI demand.\n\nPCE inflation on tap as Sept rate cut bets build\n\nFocus this week is also on PCE price index data, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. The reading is due on Friday and is likely to offer more cues on the path of interest rates.\n\nComments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday cemented expectations for an interest rate cut in September, although CME Fedwatch showed traders were split over a 25 or 50 basis point reduction.\n\nThe PCE inflation reading is likely to factor into bets on the size of the September cut.\n\nDow, S&P 500 close to record highs\n\nOptimism over interest rate cuts saw Wall Street indexes come close to record highs on Friday.\n\nThe S&P 500 surged 1.2% to 5,634.61 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% to 41,175.08 points. The NASDAQ Composite surged 1.5% to 17.877.79 points.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while the Dow and the S&P 500 were in sight of recent peaks, the Nasdaq was still trading well below a record high hit earlier this year, as a mix of profit-taking and questions over the AI rally battered technology stocks in July.\n\nExpectations of rate cuts also saw traders sell tech and pivot into more economically sensitive, value-oriented sectors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures edge lower with Nvidia earnings, rate cuts in focus\n\nFire at Rivian's Illinois plant damages multiple EVs, no injuries reported\n\nIsrael stocks higher at close of trade; TA 35 up 1.97%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy AMD Stock?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been a big winner in artificial intelligence (AI) boom. The chip designer's stock has gained 107% since OpenAI launched the game-changing ChatGPT platform. While that price climb can't compare to AI market darlings Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI), it's a market-stomping performance.\n\nLess than 30 stocks among the 503 members of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index have done better in this period, and the index itself \"only\" gained 41%. The index gain works out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8%. If I could match that soaring speed over a full decade, I'd turn a $1,000 investment into a $7,200 return. And AMD is smoking that wealth-building S&P 500 return right now. AMD Chart\n\nBut that's already old news. Past results are no guarantee of future success. The burning question existing and potential AMD investors should ask today is whether the stock has room to run any higher from this lofty perch.\n\nHow AMD's Instinct AI accelerator chip stacks up against Nvidia\n\nAMD is no spring chicken in the high-performance computing market. The AMD Instinct MI250X accelerator chip Is found in 10 systems on the latest list of the world's 500 largest and most powerful supercomputers.\n\nNvidia dominates that system list, led by at least 48 systems using the V100 accelerator and more than 80 relying on some version of the A100 chip. But when you look at the performance numbers, the leading AMD chip with a 2% share of system counts delivers a staggering 21.4% of the entire list's number-crunching performance.\n\nThe Instinct MI250X didn't do it through unbeatable performance per chip. This achievement was built on massive installation numbers. The AMD Instinct systems have 12.7 million processor cores at work in those ten massive supercomputers, led by 8.7 million Instinct cores in the greatest performer of them all -- the Frontier system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The largest Nvidia-based systems stop around 2 million processor cores.\n\nI apologize if that got a bit nerdy with processor details and big numbers. In short, a lot of cheaper chips can do the same job as a few expensive, top-of-the-line processors. I'm trying to make a simple point, though:\n\nAMD's AI accelerators are very competitive, especially if you include unit pricing. Throwing lots of lower-priced hardware at AI problems can make up for any edge Nvidia's chips might have in terms of plain performance.\n\nIn other words, AMD may deserve a bigger slice of the AI market than it gets credit for today. CFO Jean Hu and CEO Lisa Su like to focus on the total cost of ownership (TCO) when comparing AMD's products to Nvidia's, and the company is already winning system deals from that angle. This concept includes chip prices, power consumption, support for more memory per chip, and other total system aspects that can outweigh Nvidia's lead in pure performance per chip.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs AMD's price premium justified?\n\nSo AMD should be on your list of AI hardware providers to watch. Should it be your next buy in the AI space?\n\nAs it turns out, AMD's stock might already have the market respect it deserves. As noted earlier, AMD's stock chart makes the broader market look stale and stalled. Moreover, these shares are more richly valued than Nvidia's in many ways:\n\nValuation Metric AMD Nvidia Price to earnings (P/E) 183 72 Price to free cash flow (P/FCF) 183 80 Enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes (EV/EBIT) 275 63\n\nData from Finviz and Morningstar, current as of 8/23/2024.\n\nAMD's shares are more affordable in terms of price to sales or the price to earnings to growth ratio, so it's not a slam dunk in either direction. Still, it's hard to call AMD's stock \"affordable\" in any way, shape, or form.\n\nCan AMD carve out a lucrative AI niche?\n\nLongtime AMD investors should be used to uncomfortably high valuation ratios. This stock has a long history of soaring to lofty valuation ratios.\n\nDue to AMD's tendency toward low profit margins, the math gets a little bit absurd sometimes. P/FCF and P/E ratios were measured in the thousands in 2004,as the K2 line of PC processors put up a spirited fight against Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Celeron and Pentium 4 lineups. AMD stock was also more pricey than Nvidia's from 2018 to 2021, when both companies had unexpected manufacturing advantages over a struggling Intel.\n\nSo the real question is, will AMD be able to carve out a lucrative niche for itself in this era of heavy AI interest?\n\nI'm thinking that it can. Nothing seems impossible under the leadership of Lisa Su, who also seems to have a good handle on how to make the most of this game-changing moment. AMD isn't trying to be Nvidia 2.0, but choosing a different path with significantly different plans and designs.\n\nSo the stock is expensive, but then it kind of always is. And I think there's plenty of room for a different approach to AI computing from a company (or several) not named Nvidia. Check your risk tolerance before going any further, but AMD could be an interesting buy for growth investors who respect Lisa Su's leadership.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings highlight a busy end of August: What to know this week",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told investors on Friday \"time has come for policy to adjust.\"\n\nIn response, stocks finished the week near record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.\n\nBut the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test this week with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.\n\nA done deal\n\nOn Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.\n\nBut he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.\n\nPowell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.\n\nWith only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.\n\n\"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 38.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen the day prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nCapital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.\n\n\"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\"\n\nWhile Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomists expect annual \"core\" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.\n\nPowell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\"\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.\n\nAs has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.\n\nThe stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.\n\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.\"We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.\"\n\nVinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.\n\n\"Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,\" Vinh said.\n\nCharles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment office Omar Aguilar said the release will be a \"very anticipated\" release for the broader market too.\n\n\"What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,\" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 4, 2024. (I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nTech volatility could be 'behind us'\n\nWhipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.\n\n\"I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,\" Snider said.\n\nThe rally in this group — which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia — between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.\n\n\"The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,\" Snider added. \"Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.\"\n\nFor the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.\n\nSnider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"\n\nHe added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\n\n\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.\n\nNow, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.\n\nNothing like price to change an investor's feelings.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)\n\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)\n\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)\n\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

        "title": "2 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now: AI Chip Edition",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to be one of the biggest disruptive secular growth trends of all time. Most sources project the global AI market to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the 30% to 40% range through 2030, with 2030 market sizes ranging from over $800 billion to more than $1 trillion.\n\nThe AI revolution had been underway in recent years but just kicked into high gear in early 2023. This occurred following the advent of generative AI, which greatly expanded the potential use cases for AI. Generative AI wowed the tech world when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\n\nThere are several main ways to invest in AI. This article focuses on companies that are largely developing and supplying semiconductors, or \"chips,\" and other technology to enable AI capabilities.\n\nBest AI chip/technology stocks\n\nCompany Market Cap Forward P/E Ratio Wall Street's Projected 5-Year Annualized EPS Growth Year-to-Date 2024 Return 10-Year Return Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $3.2 trillion 47 46.4% 161% 28,220% Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) $142 billion 86 31.2% 80% N/A* S&P 500 Index N/A N/A N/A 19% 241%\n\nData sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. Data to Aug. 23, 2024. P/E = price-to-earnings. EPS = earnings per share. *Arm held its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2023.\n\nLet's put the 10-year percentage gains in monetary terms. Here's how much $1,000 invested a decade ago in each of the following would be worth now:\n\nBroader market (S&P 500): $3,410 Nvidia: $283,200 (yep, more than a quarter of a million dollars)\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTo call Nvidia \"dominant\" in the AI chip space is an understatement. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for accelerating the processing of AI workloads in data centers.\n\nBy all accounts, Nvidia has well over a 90% share of the market for AI GPU chips for data centers and over 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su projects the fast-growing data center AI chip market will reach $400 billion in revenue by 2027, which equates to an average annual growth rate of about 73%.\n\nNvidia isn't a pure play on AI, but it's as close as you can get in the semiconductor space. Its data center market platform accounted for 87% of its revenue in its quarter ended in late April, and this business largely supplies chips and related technology (including networking tech and software) for enabling AI and high-performance computing.\n\nAI is also enhancing Nvidia's offerings in its other platforms, which include computer gaming (10% of last quarter's revenue), professional visualization (1.9%), and auto and robotics (1.5%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended late July) on Wednesday, Aug. 28, after the market close. Management guided for revenue to grow 107% year over year to $28 billion. It also guided (indirectly by providing a bunch of inputs) for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.22, or 130% growth.\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nArm, based in the U.K., designs architectures for central processing units (CPUs) and licenses those designs and related intellectual property (IP) to customers. Its customers include many of the biggest names in consumer technology and semiconductors, including Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.\n\nArm, founded in 1990, was critical in enabling the smartphone revolution. Its chip architecture is very energy-efficient, allowing smartphones to have good battery performance, which led to their fast adoption. Arm-based chips are found in about 99% of smartphones, as well as in countless other small form-factor products.\n\nIn recent years, the company has expanded into higher-value markets, such as data center servers, AI accelerators, and smartphone applications (apps) processors. AI is driving growth in all these markets. The company said in its most recent earnings report that \"AI's substantial energy requirements are driving growth in Arm's compute platform, which is the most power-efficient solution available.\"\n\nIn late July, Arm reported its results for its first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in late June 2024. Revenue surged 39% year over year to $939 million, sprinting by the $908 million Wall Street consensus estimate. License revenue rocketed 72% to $472 million, and royalty revenue jumped 17% to $467 million.\n\nThe even better news for investors is that Arm's profit grew even more than its revenue, which means its profit margin continued to expand. Adjusted for one-time items, its net income was $419 million, or $0.40 per share, up a whopping 67% year over year. That result easily beat the $0.34 analysts had expected.\n\nI included the adjusted net income figure to highlight how extremely profitable Arm is. Its adjusted profit margin in the quarter was 44.6% ($419 million divided by $939 million).\n\nWhat about valuations for Nvidia and Arm stocks?\n\nNvidia stock is trading at 47 times its projected earnings for the current fiscal year. That's high in a vacuum -- but reasonable for a company that Wall Street expects to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 46.4% over the next five years. Moreover, Nvidia regularly exceeds earnings estimates easily, so 46.4% is likely to prove too low.\n\nArm's stock is incredibly pricey. It's trading at 86 times its projected earnings for the current fiscal year. This is very high not only in a vacuum but also for a company that Wall Street projects will grow earnings at an average annual pace of 31.2% over the next five years.\n\nSo, why do I consider Arm stock the second-best (behind Nvidia) AI tech stock to buy now? I'm working on a full article on why it's worth paying up for Arm stock, so suffice it to say that there are good reasons to believe that Wall Street is significantly underestimating Arm's earnings growth potential. In each of the company's four quarters as a public company, it has cruised by the analyst consensus earnings estimate.\n\nThat said, before making an investment decision, some investors might want to watch Arm for another couple of quarters to see whether it keeps churning out robust top- and bottom-line growth and sailing by Wall Street's estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom will create fortunes for savvy investors. Here are two innovative AI leaders that are set to deliver wealth-building returns to their shareholders.\n\nAI stock to buy No. 1: SoundHound AI\n\nSoundHound AI's (NASDAQ: SOUN) state-of-the-art voice technology can interpret speech in a similar manner to the human brain. Its conversational AI provides a faster and more accurate experience than competing platforms -- at a time when companies are rushing to harness the power of this game-changing tech.\n\nRestaurants use SoundHound AI's tools to create custom voice assistants. Its smart answering and ordering solutions eliminate customer wait times by processing multiple orders simultaneously. The tech can also boost profitability by enabling a restaurant to process more orders and reduce labor costs. Customers include Papa John's, Casey's, and Chipotle.\n\nAutomotive titans are also racing to adopt SoundHound's technology. The voice AI pioneer's speech recognition software integrates with generative AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It provides access to a vast amount of real-time information like navigation, weather, and maintenance updates conveniently delivered via hands-free controls. Leading automakers, including Mercedes Benz, Stellantis, and Honda, count among SoundHound's growing list of clients.\n\nSoundHound's sales, in turn, are expanding at a torrid clip. The company's revenue jumped by 54% year over year to $13.5 million in the second quarter.\n\nProfitability should come as the small-cap company continues to scale its operations. SoundHound's recent move to acquire enterprise AI software provider Amelia ought to help in this regard. Management expects the deal to boost SoundHound's earnings by the second half of 2025.\n\nAI stock to buy No. 2: Advanced Micro Devices\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) AI chips are selling like hotcakes. So much so that the semiconductor designer has struggled to meet the booming demand for this increasingly crucial technology. These shortfalls have kept prices elevated and delayed the AI plans of many companies. Chip buyers clearly want more supply. They're eager to embrace a new competitor to Nvidia -- and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is up to the task.\n\nAMD's data center revenue soared 115% to $2.8 billion in the second quarter. These gains were fueled by strong sales of the company's new AI accelerators, which help to quicken machine learning workloads.\n\nCEO Lisa Su sees revenue for AMD's new AI chips surging to more than $4.5 billion in 2024. Yet the chipmaker is just scratching the surface of its long-term market opportunity. Su predicts that global AI chip sales will grow to a whopping $400 billion by 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD could capture 20% of this rapidly expanding market by 2028, according to analysts at Piper Sandler. Large chip buyers, such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are reportedly planning to integrate AMD's AI accelerators into their cloud computing operations.\n\nLike SoundHound, AMD is using acquisitions to strengthen its competitive position and accelerate its expansion. The tech leader completed its $665 million purchase of Silo AI on Aug. 12. Europe's largest private AI lab comes with a team of experienced scientists and engineers who will work to bolster AMD's model and software development efforts.\n\nJust days later, AMD struck a deal to acquire ZT Systems for $4.9 billion. The AI infrastructure provider should fortify AMD's ability to design and deploy large-scale cloud computing systems for its customers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Get on the Nvidia Stock Bandwagon? 3 Motley Fool Contributors Weigh In",
        "content": "Do you remember where you were during the great Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) dip of 2024?\n\nNvidia, arguably the flagship stock of the artificial intelligence (AI) market rally, was trading at all-time highs in mid-July. Then it quickly stumbled by 20% when markets briefly turned fearful in early August. Fast-forward a couple of weeks, and Nvidia is already trading back near its former highs.\n\nWas the sudden sell-off a fluke, or is the Nvidia bandwagon at risk of going off the rails?\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors weighed in on Nvidia stock's recent momentum and whether shares are worth buying today. Here is what you need to know.\n\nNvidia stock will remain the AI chip leader, but buy cautiously\n\nWill Healy: Admittedly, one cannot discuss the bull run in generative AI stocks without discussing Nvidia. As the dominant producer of AI chips, it drove massive stock gains since the fall of 2022, and investors should not expect Nvidia to be unseated as the industry leader anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm have moved aggressively into this market. But despite some setbacks, Nvidia continues to innovate with the upcoming Blackwell chip, and such updates should help it maintain its market leadership.\n\nHowever, it is also safe to say the market has priced this dominance into the stock. Since its low point of the 2022 bear market, the stock has risen by as much as 1,000%.\n\nThat rapid growth may make its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio a poor reflection of its valuation. But make no mistake; it is expensive by most measures. Its surge in the most recent bull market has taken the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to almost 40, far above the S&P 500 average of 3.\n\nHowever, forecasts of triple-digit revenue growth bode well for Nvidia despite the nosebleed P/S ratio. Amid the predictions, the forward P/S ratio is 26, and the forward one-year P/S ratio falls to 19. While those ratios still make the stock pricey and vulnerable to sell-offs in the near term, they also make it less likely any pullback in Nvidia stock will be long-lasting.\n\nHence, investors who are not highly risk averse should not only keep their Nvidia shares but also consider gradually adding shares through dollar-cost averaging (DCA). DCA investing allows investors to have a position while leaving them open to buy shares at a lower price amid any near-term pullback.\n\nUltimately, Nvidia's leadership in AI chips has made it a pricey stock. Still, by employing a DCA approach, investors should be able to safely add to positions while leaving some cash available to buy more shares amid the likely price fluctuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is a wonderful company, but its stock is very expensive\n\nJake Lerch: Is Nvidia a great company? Yes. Does it have a wonderful future ahead of it? More than likely. Do I want to buy Nvidia shares right now? Not really.\n\nIn a nutshell, that's the paradox I find myself confronting with Nvidia as of this writing. I know the company has a great lineup of blockbuster products. I know its sales are through the roof, and they'll likely keep expanding for years to come.\n\nYet, Nvidia's stock is just so expensive. So expensive in fact that my inner-value investor keeps begging me to stop saying yes to Nvidia.\n\nHere's what's going on by the numbers: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nNot that long ago, Nvidia's stock sported a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio below 3. Granted, that was low, as the average tech P/S ratio is typically around the high-single digits. But today, the stock's P/S ratio is an incredible 40. Not only is that far above the average for all stocks -- including tech stocks -- it's more than twice the 10-year average for Nvidia stock itself.\n\nAs recently as 2022, investors could scoop up shares of Nvidia by paying 10 times sales. Those days are long gone, and that's giving me pause. Again, even on a one-year forward P/S basis, Nvidia's stock is trading at historically high levels. NVDA PS Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nSure, the company could release guidance that blows away the current estimates and sends the stock even higher, but it could also temper expectations and leave the market disappointed. Given its current valuation, that might mean a big drop for the stock. So, I think investors who don't already have a Nvidia position should wait and see rather than jump on the Nvidia bandwagon right now.\n\nNvidia could be vulnerable if the market falters\n\nJustin Pope: Nvidia shareholders enjoyed market-crushing returns with relatively little stress until the stock's recent stumble. I don't know if Nvidia will be higher next month than today; nobody knows. However, the recent dip teaches investors an essential lesson about volatility: It cuts in both directions.\n\nInvestors can use a stock's beta value to gauge its volatility. A stock that behaves exactly like the S&P 500 will have a beta value of 1. A beta of less than 1 means the stock is less reactive to the market; it rises slower when the broader market goes up and falls slower when it goes down. A beta of more than 1 signals a more reactive stock; it will outperform the market on good days and fall faster on the market's bad days. Nvidia's beta is almost 1.7; it has crushed the market because the S&P 500 has continually chugged higher on Wall Street's excitement for AI technology. The market had a rough few days in early August, and Nvidia's stock plunged to 20% off its high.\n\nAt this point, Nvidia is widely known for its leadership in AI chips, so I'm not denying the potential long-term growth opportunities. However, as my fellow Fool.com contributors have pointed out, the stock is expensive today. The reality is that Nvidia remains susceptible to aggressive selling pressure if volatility returns to the broader market. I'm no fortune teller, but it's not hard to imagine the market getting shaky over the coming months. Economic data shows a weakening economy, including a massive downward revision to America's job growth over the past year. It remains to be seen whether the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates and to what extent. And if that wasn't enough, there is a presidential election just months away. The market has been remarkably resilient since early last year, but taking that for granted would be unwise.\n\nSo, how should investors play this? Since nobody can predict the market or events that may impact stocks, a dollar-cost average strategy is the way to go. As Will said, slow and steady buying through the ups and downs will help investors make the most of any market volatility.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAre you ready for the single most important earnings report of 2024?\n\nInterestingly, this company won the award for the single most important earnings report of 2024 (and every quarter in 2023) when it reported three months ago!\n\nI am talking about Nvidia (NVDA). Earnings are out on Aug. 28 after the close of trading.\n\nEvery day, I get to the office by 4:20 a.m. and turn on some software we use to track which stories and ticker pages are garnering the most interest from Yahoo Finance readers. Every single day, one of the most actively viewed pages on our platform is for Nvidia.\n\nThe world could be on the cusp of an alien attack, and I fancy people will still be hitting refresh on the Nvidia ticker page. Investors have become absolutely obsessed with a company they had never even heard of two years ago.\n\nI can't blame them.\n\nNvidia's stock is up 170% in the past year. Nvidia's stock is up 3,000% in the past five years.\n\nThese are insane gains, the type that lure in the less-experienced investor hoping to retire early.\n\nAnd Nvidia's story is surprisingly easy to grasp despite the company's incredibly complicated business. Nvidia makes the best artificial intelligence chips in a world being upheaved by AI. Simple. No one is even close to Nvidia in terms of AI chip performance and forward-looking demand.\n\nI do want to caution that the setup on Nvidia going into the quarterly report is a little different this go around. While the Street is staying super bullish on Nvidia heading into the print, they are a touch cautious amid reported shipment delays for Nvidia's powerful new AI chip Blackwell.\n\nThere is good reason for the bullishness based on a host of recent signals from earnings reports:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just cited strong AI demand when it reported. AMD (AMD) recently lifted its sales for data center chips for the third time in a year. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cited strong demand for its liquid cooling solutions. Nvidia chip customer Meta (META) just raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 and 2025 by billions.\n\n\"We expect Nvidia to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs. Given the Blackwell delay, we believe Nvidia will prioritize the ramp of B200 for hyperscalers and has effectively canceled B100, which will be replaced with a lower cost/performance GPU (B200A) targeted at enterprise customers,\" Keybanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Nvidia's report to be embraced, I think investors need to see at least two things:\n\nNvidia must convey that reported Blackwell shipment delays aren't a structural issue. Nvidia must show strong quarter-over-quarter sales growth in its data center business.\n\nIf this happens, it could shake off a few bears and set the table for what EMJ Capital founder and tech investor Eric Jackson told me on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\"I'm saying [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" Jackson said.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.2 trillion or so currently.\n\nJackson reasons the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report this week or in November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.\n\nRest up. It's going to be a busy week ahead.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "Despite some volatility in the stock market so far in August, Nvidia stock (NVDA) remains up over 150% this year.\n\nDriving the stock is Nvidia's role in supplying chips to major tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) that are crucial for artificial intelligence technology amid the broader generative AI boom.\n\nOver a third of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) market cap gains in the first half of 2024 could be attributed to Nvidia. For some investors, the concentration of gains in a few stocks such as Nvidia seems risky. It was a point that was underlined earlier this month by a stock rout that briefly pushed the volatility index (^VIX) above 60 and shares of Nvidia down by as much as 10%.\n\nStocks ended up recovering, but the period offered a reminder to investors that they could seek AI opportunities elsewhere.\n\nFor those looking to gain an edge and diversify their tech holdings, understanding AI's core technology and terminology is essential.\n\nHere's a breakdown of a few of the terms you need to know to invest in the AI boom:\n\nInference\n\nInference is AI’s moment of truth. It's when an AI model like ChatGPT generates an answer to a prompt based on its previous training and learning. The quality of an AI system's inference relies heavily on its underlying technology stack, including the powerful chips that drive it. President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCompute\n\nCompute power is the driving force behind an AI system's success, similar to how horsepower propels a car. The greater the compute power, the more efficient and faster the inference process becomes.\n\nProcessing power, memory, and storage all fuel compute power, and chipmakers tend to focus on increased compute power for new chip releases because improvements in compute power with each chip generation could allow companies to charge more, which typically bodes well for future profit margins.\n\nGPUs\n\nGraphics processing units, or GPUs, are advanced and expensive chips that power AI. Their quality can help determine the speed of AI computations. Nvidia, which began working on GPUs in the '90s, owns over 80% of the GPU market and mentioned the term 19 times in its first quarter earnings presentation. Nvidia’s GPUs have increased AI inference performance by a thousand times over the last decade.\n\nHyperscalers\n\nBig Tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon are considered hyperscalers, or those capable of rapidly scaling AI. With products and services such as Microsoft's Copilot, Alphabet's Gemini, and Meta's Llama, these companies are significant both as consumers of AI chips and competitors to chipmakers.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is a king of reliability, known for its consistent financial and stock growth. Over the last five years, the company's share price has risen 200%, while free cash flow has climbed 92%.\n\nMicrosoft's steady growth has secured it a market cap above $3 trillion, allowing it to remain in the world's top three most valuable companies. In fact, from about February to June of this year, Microsoft temporarily surpassed Apple and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in market cap, taking the top spot.\n\nMarket fluctuations have seen the world's top five most valuable companies reshuffle multiple times in 2024. Even throughout August, Nvidia and Microsoft have been duking it out for second place on an almost weekly basis. Meanwhile, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) appears to be on a bull run that could surpass the Windows company in the coming years.\n\nNvidia and Amazon have been on exciting growth paths thanks to skyrocketing earnings. These companies dominate their respective industries and are profiting from consistent investment in the lucrative artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nWhile Microsoft is known for consistency, Nvidia and Amazon are expanding at a rate that could allow them to overtake the company. So, here are two growth stocks I predict will be worth more than Microsoft in five years.\n\n1. Nvidia: A meteoric rise that is unlikely to slow any time soon\n\nNvidia's business has delivered record growth since the start of 2023, with its stock up 779%. Its meteoric rise has seen it steadily climb through the ranks of the world's most valuable companies, as seen in the chart below. AAPL Market Cap Chart\n\nAs of this writing, Nvidia's market cap is above Microsoft's. Their positions switched multiple times this month, suggesting could swap again by the time you read this. However, Nvidia is included in this list as I'd argue that it will have surpassed Microsoft for good and gained a solid lead within the next five years.\n\nNvidia massively outperformed Microsoft in 2024, with its stock up 159% compared to Microsoft's 10% rise. Meanwhile, Nvidia's quarterly revenue is up 18% year to date, with Microsoft's up 4%. At this rate, Nvidia could even secure its spot ahead of Microsoft much sooner than five years.\n\nNvidia's stellar gains are primarily thanks to its dominance in AI. The company is responsible for between 70% and 95% of all AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training AI models. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working to catch up, launching rival GPUs this year. However, Nvidia's head start and $39 billion in free cash flow (compared to AMD's $1 billion and Intel's negative $13 billion) suggests it won't have too much trouble maintaining its lead.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn AI, Microsoft has a prominent role in cloud computing. However, fellow cloud giants Amazon and Alphabet are much closer competitors than Nvidia's rivals in the GPU market.\n\nNvidia will report its second quarter of fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug. 28. After over a year of beating quarterly earnings, the company will likely continue recent trends and deliver another quarter of impressive growth. Its stock could soar, furthering its lead on Microsoft.\n\n2. Amazon: Soaring earnings and the cash to surpass its rivals\n\nAmazon and Microsoft are in steep competition in the cloud industry. As of Q2 2024, Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud market share stood at 31%, while Microsoft Azure's was at 25%. However, Amazon ramped up its cloud investment over the last year, which could allow it to hold onto its lead in the industry and eventually push its market cap above Microsoft's. MSFT Chart\n\nAmazon consistently outperformed Microsoft over the last year. Solid growth in retail and AWS has seen Amazon's profits soar, allowing it to sink billions into its AI efforts.\n\nIn March, Bloomberg reported that Amazon plans to spend nearly $150 billion on data centers over the next 15 years to expand AWS' reach. The company anticipates an explosion of demand for AI applications and other digital services, requiring a more extensive cloud network. The news aligns with multiple reports in recent months that announced Amazon's data center investment in U.S. locations including Ohio, Indiana, and Virginia, as well as international spots such as Singapore, Spain, Saudi Arabia, India, and Taiwan.\n\nThe expansion will increase Amazon's cloud and AI capabilities. Meanwhile, a vast network will allow it to boost other areas of its business with the generative technology, such as e-commerce, grocery, digital advertising, and more.\n\nAmazon's market cap currently sits at $1.8 trillion. However, its earnings and stock are expanding at a rate that will likely see it overtake Microsoft in the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The rally in U.S. markets will be tested this week when earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are released. U.S. inflation data will likely underline expectations for long awaited rate cuts, while the Eurozone and Australia are also to release inflation data that will inform the trajectory of interest rates. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead.\n\nNvidia results\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence could be tested when Nvidia reports earnings after the close on Wednesday.\n\nThe earnings report along with guidance on whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is historically a volatile time of the year.\n\nNvidia stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date gain. But the stunning, multi-year run and AI-mania have also drawn comparisons to the dot-com craze that imploded more than two decades ago.\n\nThe results come at the end of an earnings season during which investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI. Examples include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), whose shares are all down since their July reports.\n\nU.S. data\n\nThe highlight of the economic calendar will be Friday's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation yardstick.\n\nSpeaking at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole symposium on Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged recent progress on inflation and said that “the time has come for policy to adjust.”\n\n\"We do not see or welcome further weakening in labor market conditions,\" Powell added in a speech that appeared to all but guarantee a rate cut at next month's policy meeting, which would be the first such cut in over four years.\n\nThe economic calendar also includes a report on durable goods orders on Monday and revised second-quarter GDP figures on Thursday along with the weekly report on initial jobless claims.\n\nEurozone inflation\n\nEurozone inflation data for August, due for release on Friday, will be pivotal in shaping the European Central Bank’s decision on interest rates for September.\n\nThis report, which follows national releases beginning on Thursday, comes after a small but unexpected uptick in inflation in July, signalling challenges in bringing inflation under control.\n\nWhile headline inflation is expected to ease, partly due to falling oil prices, attention will remain on core inflation and the services sector, where price increases have proven more persistent.\n\nStory continues\n\nAny upside surprises in the data could prompt caution, especially as traders have increased their expectations for an ECB rate cut in recent weeks.\n\nMarket expectations are heavily tilted towards a 25-basis point rate cut on September 12, with a high probability of additional cuts by the end of the year.\n\nAustralia inflation\n\nWednesday's July inflation numbers could show headline inflation pulling back into the Reserve Bank of Australia’s 2-3% target band for the first time in three years.\n\nAny indication that inflationary pressures are easing could intensify scrutiny on the central bank, seen as a global outlier for its reluctance to cut rates while many other central banks have embarked on, or are contemplating, easing cycles.\n\nInvestors are also looking to Wednesday’s data to potentially offer some relief to consumer sentiment, which has been weighed down by high borrowing costs.\n\nElsewhere, Tokyo’s August inflation report, due for release on Friday, may provide further clues into Japan's monetary policy outlook.\n\nGold\n\nGold has reached consecutive record highs since 2022 and has surged over 20% so far this year, with $3,000 an ounce now within sight.\n\nThe precious metal, traditionally viewed as a safe haven during periods of heightened security risks and political and economic instability, has benefitted from several converging factors.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered an initial rally in gold prices. Rising commodity prices and subsequent inflation, which erodes the value of fiat currencies, further supported the uptrend.\n\nOngoing tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. Presidential election have also contributed to gold’s gains. Additionally, expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts are pressuring the dollar, making gold more attractive as it typically has an inverse relationship with the U.S. currency.\n\nHowever, gold investors should be cautious, as markets often experience corrections with the adage \"nothing goes up in a straight line,\" reflecting the tendency to \"buy the rumour, sell the fact.\"\n\n--Reuters contributed reporting\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTop 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead\n\nTurkey's Isbank CEO sees challenges ahead, November rate cut\n\nChina slams US for adding firms to export control list, vows action\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are causing a paradigm shift in technology, and the consequences will likely be far-reaching. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the de facto standard bearer for the AI revolution, as its state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training AI models and conducting AI inference.\n\nThe accelerating adoption of generative AI has been the catalyst that has sparked parabolic growth for the chipmaker, generating triple-digit sales and profit growth in each of the past four quarters.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30) after market close on Wednesday, Aug. 28, and shareholders will be watching with keen interest. I predict the company will deliver record results, sending Nvidia stock to record heights. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYou can't spell Nvidia without AI\n\nNvidia made a name for itself as a pioneer in the video game industry, developing chips that used parallel processing, or the ability to run a multitude of complex computations simultaneously. This generated lifelike images in video games, revolutionizing the industry. Nvidia adapted this same technology to handle the raw, number-crunching needs of AI and quickly cornered the market in this emerging technology.\n\nThe vast majority of AI processing takes place in data centers, and Nvidia has already proven its worth at zipping information through the ether. The company controlled an estimated 98% of the data center GPU market last year, according to data compiled by semiconductor analysts at TechInsights.\n\nThe growing demand for AI has data center and cloud operators spending heavily to upgrade their capabilities to handle the rigors of AI processing. Making AI available to the masses is expected to unleash a wave of productivity that's expected to add trillions of dollars to the global economy.\n\nWhile Nvidia had a head start in this emerging industry, the company isn't resting on its laurels. Earlier this year, the company unveiled its Blackwell architecture, which contained a host of new technology that promises to take AI to the next level.\n\nPerhaps more impressive is the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which connects two B200 GPUs with an Nvidia Grace CPU to form \"the world's most powerful chip\" for AI.\n\nWhile there have been reports of a potential launch delay, more recent reports suggest Nvidia is still on track to begin shipping its next-generation AI chip early next year.\n\nThis all helps to illustrate that Nvidia has no plans of ceding its strategic advantage or market-leading position anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy its second-quarter financial report will be a key catalyst\n\nNvidia has proven its mettle over the past year, but investors are looking to the future. Concerns about inflation and the growth of the economy have taken center stage in recent weeks, with economists debating whether the Federal Reserve Bank has waited too long to lower interest rates or whether it can still engineer a soft landing -- bringing inflation under control, without tipping the economy into a recession. Those fears have begun to subside, so investors are turning their sights to Nvidia, which is widely viewed as a bellwether for the state of AI adoption.\n\nA look back at Nvidia's outlook in recent quarters can provide much-needed insight into what investors should expect next week. In each of the past four quarters, Nvidia has delivered triple-digit growth, which has outpaced its own guidance, and in each instance by a fair margin. Nvidia's revenue growth has sailed past its outlook by a margin of between 8% and 19%, which suggests the company's current forecast is equally conservative.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 30), Nvidia is guiding for revenue of $28 billion, representing an increase of 107% year over year. Wall Street is even more enthusiastic, with analysts' consensus estimates rising to $28.6 billion. Even that may end up being conservative, as Nvidia has surpassed investor expectations for sales and profits in each of the past four quarters -- again by a fair margin.\n\nIf Nvidia beats its own revenue guidance by at least 8% or more -- which it has done in each of the preceding four quarters -- that would put its revenue at $30 billion or more. If that's the case, it will likely come with a commensurate increase in its guidance, resulting in a classic \"beat and raise.\" Since this is almost always a bullish signal, the stock price will likely jump in response.\n\nTo be clear, investors will be watching Nvidia's forward-looking guidance for evidence the secular tailwind of AI is still blowing strong. Based on the available evidence and using history as a guide, I predict that Nvidia will deliver record-breaking results and surpass expectations, sending its stock to new heights.\n\nIs the stock worth the price?\n\nThanks to Nvidia's superb results, there's been a commensurate increase in its valuation. Analysts and investors alike have been scrambling to decide how best to value Nvidia stock, but we're in unchartered territory here. Nvidia generated revenue of $61 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), an increase of 126%. Growth of that magnitude is certainly deserving of a premium, but there's no consensus regarding the size of said premium. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia is currently selling for 75 times earnings, but that number is about to see a dramatic reset after the company delivers its financial report, as new, higher profits are factored into the ratio. The chart clearly shows the stark decline in the wake of each of its three previous financial reports in November, February, and May, respectively.\n\nWhile some investors might balk at paying in the neighborhood of 50 times earnings (represented by the dips in the stock chart), I would argue that's a fair price to pay for a company delivering triple-digit growth and leading the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nConcerns over Nvidia Blackwell delays ‘overdone,’ says Evercore\n\nEvercore ISI analysts recommend buying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker’s upcoming earnings report for the July quarter, saying that recent worries about potential delays in the release of the Blackwell system are “overdone.”\n\nThe investment bank emphasizes that demand for Nvidia's systems remains strong, as highlighted by a 20% quarter-on-quarter increase in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) during Q2 2024. Looking forward, CapEx is anticipated to grow by an additional 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4.\n\nEarlier reports indicated that Nvidia’s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which features its next-generation AI chips, might face delays of up to three months. This news sparked investor concerns over the sustainability of Nvidia's stock rally.\n\nEvercore analysts reviewed past Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, concluding that while a negative announcement could result in a short-term stock drop of 5%-10%, Nvidia has consistently shown resilience in quickly developing alternative solutions.\n\n“Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,” the analysts remarked.\n\nEvercore continues to view Nvidia as its “Top Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,” asserting that the company is well-positioned to capture up to 80% of the value in the parallel processing era. Analysts also project that Nvidia could achieve more than $10 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2030 “and that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.”\n\nThey have raised their estimates for Nvidia’s third-quarter and 2024 performance, along with increasing its target price for the stock from $145 to $150.\n\nMoffettNathanson: Apple’s AI potential is already priced in\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioned to be a significant player in the AI space, but this potential is already factored into its stock price, MoffettNathanson said in a note to clients.\n\nThe firm, which initiated coverage of Apple with a Neutral rating and set a price target of $211 per share, acknowledged Apple's strong AI strategy but noted that the market has already anticipated and priced in these developments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Apple is poised to win in AI,\" MoffettNathanson analysts said, but cautioned that \"that's exactly what's already priced in.\"\n\nThey observed that despite earlier concerns about Apple lagging in AI, the market has consistently shown confidence in the company's strategy. This was particularly evident after the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), where Apple confirmed much of its AI plans.\n\n\"By the time of their June WWDC, the broad strokes of Apple's 'contextual awareness' AI strategy were already well-anticipated by the tech intelligentsia, and hence by the market as well,\" the note states.\n\nMoffettNathanson emphasized that Apple's AI approach leverages the trust of its over one billion users, especially in handling personal data like contacts and emails, which remain exclusively under Apple's control.\n\nThe firm also said that Apple's strategy is likely to drive an iPhone upgrade cycle, but the potential impact of this cycle is already reflected in the current stock valuation.\n\n\"Apple’s new AI functionality would be presented in service of driving an iPhone upgrade cycle – Apple is, after all, still primarily a hardware provider – as capitalizing on resident inference capabilities would require at least 8 GB of RAM and a neural processor that phones older than the iPhone 15 Pro don’t have,\" they explained.\n\nEdward Jones initiates AMD stock coverage\n\nEarlier in the week, analysts at Edward Jones initiated research coverage of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and added the semiconductor giant to its Stock Focus List.\n\nThe firm sees multiple catalysts that could drive significant growth for AMD in the coming years.\n\nA key factor behind Edward Jones' optimistic outlook is the rising demand for data center infrastructure, which is expected to propel sales of AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs).\n\nThe analysts highlighted that \"growing demand for data center infrastructure should help drive accelerating sales\" of these critical products.\n\nAnother driver of Edward Jones' bullish stance is AMD's acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).\n\n\"While the acquisition of Xilinx adds new programmable chip products and end-markets to AMD's business, we believe the company remains in the early innings of cross-selling and integrating Xilinx and AMD products,\" the firm stated.\n\nThe integration of Xilinx’s programmable chip products with AMD’s existing offerings is still in its early stages, but Edward Jones sees significant potential for cross-selling opportunities, which management estimates could be worth as much as $10 billion.\n\nIn addition, the firm points to the potential for a prolonged upgrade cycle in the PC market driven by AI-enabled PCs, which could further support AMD's growth.\n\nAnalysts believe that the positive outlook for AMD is \"not fully reflected in the share price,\" presenting an attractive investment opportunity at current levels.\n\nBofA double downgrades Silicon Motion to Sell\n\nShares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) fell Friday after Bank of America analysts issued a double downgrade on the NAND flash controller supplier.\n\nThey cut their rating on SIMO stock from Buy to Underperform, citing expectations of limited growth following the upturn in the first half of 2024.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that the company’s guidance for the second half already indicates minimal top-line growth compared to Q2 2024. Their updated analysis also suggests low growth in 2025 for sales, operating profit (OP), and earnings per share (EPS).\n\n\"A key reason is likely the low exposure to AI and enterprise SSD, areas more dominated by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix, respectively,” analysts wrote.\n\nBofA has also reduced its EPS estimates for the second half of 2024 and 2025 by approximately 20%, driven by lower revenue and operating margin assumptions compared to their earlier forecasts.\n\nThe investment bank highlighted that SIMO’s revenue primarily comes from “controller IC chips” for NAND products, setting it apart from its competitor, Phison Electronics.\n\nGiven the expectation of limited growth beyond the first half of 2024, the analysts have lowered their price objective for SIMO to $60 from $90.\n\nMore broadly, BofA also noted that while demand for AI server chips remains strong, demand for commodity memory has significantly weakened.\n\nBaidu downgraded at Bernstein on share pressure expectations\n\nBernstein analysts on Friday downgraded Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) from Outperform to Market Perform following the company's latest earnings report and cut their price target from $130 to $97.\n\nThe analysts foresee the stock trading sideways due to increasing disruption and reduced clarity on future prospects.\n\n\"We expect more disruption to the near-term Search results and any limited signs of success in next few quarters (that would have allowed investors to look through to the longer term),\" they noted.\n\nThe firm also lowered its Search growth expectations by 5 percentage points for the second half of 2024 and by 3 percentage points for 2025, currently valuing the stock on a bearish outlook without factoring in any potential gains from AI Search initiatives.\n\n\"AI Cloud and Robotaxi are positive, but without Search showing a revival, we expect that shares will remain under pressure,\" Bernstein analysts added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Buy Nvidia stock ahead of earnings; BIDU downgraded\n\nBreaking down Morgan Stanley's list of top European stocks to own\n\n2025 a likely headache for OPEC\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its stock recover nicely from a pullback in late July and early August. Shares have gone from trading at levels below $100 earlier this month to around $124, as of this writing. That's approximately a 25% gain in a very short period. With so much change so fast, investors who bought the dip or who have been holding from much lower levels earlier this year may be debating whether it might make sense to take their profits and move on.\n\nThe decision about whether the stock should be sold at this level is not an easy one. The company, which creates graphic processing units (GPUs) powering the deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) craze, trades at 74 times earnings -- a high premium.

This, bulls say, is evidenced by the fact that demand for the company's flagship H200 and Blackwell chips remains ahead of supply. Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress even noted in the company's most recent earnings call that the company expects demand for these products to \"exceed supply well into next year.\"\n\nFurther, Nvidia bulls might point to the company's revenue guidance for its fiscal second quarter of 2025 to show how growth is continuing. Management forecast fiscal second-quarter revenue of $28 billion, a figure translating to more than a doubling of revenue and likely even faster earnings-per-share growth. Momentum like this will likely help quickly bring down Nvidia's high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\n\nThe bear case\n\nFundamental to the bear case for Nvidia stock is the fact that the market is forward looking -- particularly when dealing with stocks trading at high premium valuations. This means that Wall Street may severely punish Nvidia shares if it starts seeing evidence of potential future deterioration of revenue growth rates or earnings. A simple comment from management during an earnings call about demand and supply for Nvidia's key products getting closer to equilibrium, therefore, could spook investors and cause them to no longer believe the stock deserves a valuation multiple as high as it currently commands.\n\nFurther, what appears to be Nvidia's strength today -- its high profit margin -- is the same factor that makes it vulnerable. For instance, the company's gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 impressively expanded from 66.8% in the year-ago quarter to 78.9%. However, a higher-than-usual gross margin means normalization could occur in the future as demand catches up to supply and as competitors do a better job making competing products.\n\nIn an environment like this, Nvidia may have to lower the price of its products, and its margins could take a hit. This could lead to not only a slowdown in earnings but possibly even a decline.\n\nHeadwinds to Nvidia's margins and earnings growth (if they ever materialize) could be more than a year away. But a forward-looking market could start pricing in these risks any moment.\n\nOverall, Nvidia seems like a great company, but a risky stock at this price. Selling shares and buying something more attractive may make sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The company has also beaten earnings per share estimates in six straight quarters and eight of the last 10 quarters.\n\nFreedom Capital Markets Chief Global Strategist Jay Woods emphasized the importance of Nvidia’s earnings report on the market during an interview on Benzinga’s “PreMarket Prep.”\n\nWoods said there’s been a pause in Magnificent 7 stocks, including Nvidia.\n\n“We’re seeing consolidation in those Mag 7 names now,” Woods said.\n\nThe market strategist said Nvidia was the tell to the market changing last August.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2023, the stock gapped up at the open, filled the gap, and closed slightly higher after reporting earnings. In the months that followed, the stock declined from $480 (now split-adjusted to $48) to $400 (now split-adjusted to $40) before breaking out in January 2024.\n\nWoods said Nvidia is the one stock to watch next week and the $140 level could be a key metric ahead of earnings, a level the market strategist does not see the stock hitting before Wednesday.\n\nWhy It’s Important: Woods calls Nvidia a market leader and as a top stock, one that could move the markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market strategist said the stock could take a lot of boats with it, depending on how investors react to the earnings.\n\nAs one of the most valuable companies in the world, Nvidia has a large weighting in many indexes and ETFs, Woods warned.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY lists Nvidia as the third-largest holding at 6.5%, trailing only Apple Inc AAPL at 6.9% and Microsoft Corporation MSFT at 6.6%.\n\nRead More:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.

The current weightings for the fund have Microsoft first at 21.2%, Nvidia second at 20.9% and Apple third at 4.9%.\n\n“You better know that Nvidia [is] now more important than Apple is.”\n\nAlthough Woods is cautious about Nvidia's momentum ahead of its second-quarter results, he still considers the stock one of the best long-term picks.\n\n“My best idea is just buy Nvidia and put it away and don’t look at it.”\n\nWoods recalled his father buying shares of Nvidia after hearing him talk about it on TV in 2019. His father put the stock away and forgot about it, before asking Woods what a 10-for-1 stock split meant for his stake. Woods said the investment went from $3,000 to over $100,000.\n\nThe example could perfectly illustrate Benzinga’s “if you invested $1,000” story series on how a small investment could pay off over time based on key catalysts and events.\n\nLock In High Rates Now With A Short-Term Commitment\n\nLeaving your cash where it is earning nothing is like wasting money.

        "content": "A survey conducted by Evercore ISI showed a shift in expectations regarding the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe survey, which gathered responses from nearly 350 participants during a Macro&Fundamental webinar, showed that VP Kamala Harris was chosen more frequently than Donald Trump as the likely winner in November.\n\nHarris attracted 50% of responses versus 29% for Trump. In a new answer option, 21% expect that the outcome of the election will not be clear by 11/7, two days after election day.\n\n\"Now that both conventions are completed, we think both met their goals. Unfortunately for the Republicans, the race entirely changed after their convention ended. We expect the Democrats to get a traditional post-convention bump in the polls,\" the analysts said.\n\n\"But then post-Labor Day we’ll start to get a sense of where this race really stands. We still think it’s a toss-up.\n\n\"While right now the momentum favors Harris, the electoral college still favors Republicans.\"\n\nThe survey results also indicated a mixed forecast for the future of AI infrastructure spending. A total of 34% of respondents anticipate a moderation in spending in the second half of 2025, while another 34% expect a deceleration after that period. Meanwhile, 32% predict a slowdown before the second half of 2025.\n\nIn terms of stock performance, 57% of those surveyed believe that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will close between $120 and $140 on August 29, following its earnings report on August 28.\n\nThe survey also touched on broader market expectations, with 79% of investors predicting that the S&P 500 will close within a 5% range of its current level by September 30.\n\nThis is significant as September is traditionally considered the weakest and most volatile month for the stock market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nInvestors see Harris winning the election, Evercore's survey shows\n\nâ€‹â€‹RFK was hurting Trump more than Harris in recent weeks: Strategas\n\nKamala Harris caps convention with call to end Gaza war, fight tyranny\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\n“Now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions,” Sluymer reportedly said.\n\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\n“If you look at what we’ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it’s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it’s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,” Ives said.\n\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush in a fresh note said the latest results from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and some other top tech companies should soothe market concerns about AI monetization.\n\n“On the semi front, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is now on the cusp of getting a piece of the growing AI $1 trillion of Cap Ex we expect to see over the next few years with the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia leading the charge,” Ives said.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\n“Now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions,” Sluymer reportedly said.\n\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\n“If you look at what we’ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it’s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it’s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,” Ives said.\n\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?\n\nPhoto by Javier Esteban on Unsplash\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 179\n\nAnalysts are bracing for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled for a release later this month. Jefferies said in a latest note that the company will smash analyst expectations for the quarter.\n\n“We expect another strong beat in July and strong guidance into October, with beats of about $1B for the results and guide,” analysts said.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies also believe the demand for Nvidia’s Hopper chips is strong.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns about NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings 'absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade'",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) is back. But it’s about to be put to the test again.\n\nThe next big event for the market is the chip darling’s earnings report, set for after the bell Wednesday.\n\nAnd it’s not just Nvidia stock that’s on the line: Nvidia’s results will set the pace for other AI players.\n\n“Nvidia’s report and guidance will be absolutely key to the AI infrastructure trade,” tech investor Paul Meeks told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe past several weeks have been a roller-coaster ride for tech investors. Shares of AI giants Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are down over the past three months, with Alphabet falling more than 6% and both Amazon and Microsoft down more than 3%.\n\nAnd second-tier AI players are struggling to regain traction as well. AMD (AMD) has fallen more than 16% since mid-July while Marvell Technology (MRVL) is off nearly 6% in the same period.\n\nBut strong results from Nvidia could reignite some of that lost momentum, according to Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\n“Nvidia is the heart and lungs of this bullish tech trade as the AI Revolution takes hold,” Ives told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIves, who expects a “shock and awe” quarter from Nvidia, says continued strong demand for the company’s chips will have ripple effects across the industry. In a recent note to clients, Ives estimated that for every dollar spent on a Nvidia GPU chip, there is an $8 to $10 multiplier across the tech sector.\n\nBernstein’s Mark Shmulik, who covers many of Nvidia's biggest customers including Meta, Amazon, and Google, told me the chip giant’s results will be a critical driver of Big Tech’s next move.\n\n“Nvidia is a bellwether of the Magnificent Seven and AI trade,” Shmulik explained. “If there is any softness, maybe rotation out of the Mag 7 picks up a little bit of steam, but listening to other tech earnings, core fundamentals keep delivering.”\n\nSo far this year, Nvidia’s stock has soared. Shares are up 180% over the past year and up nearly 2,900% over the past five years — setting the bar very high for earnings this quarter.\n\nEstimates are for Nvidia's revenue to grow 112% in its latest quarter, marking a dramatic slowdown from over 250% growth one year ago. For Wall Street, consensus remains bullish. KeyBanc, Citi, and Goldman Sachs were among those on the street who reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock this week ahead of results.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Nvidia lives up to the hype this earnings season, it’s safe to say the stakes are high.

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be the Best-Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks of 2024",
        "content": "You've likely heard some form of the disclaimer, \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\" And the statement is true. However, I'd add something to the disclaimer: \"But a big head start is nearly always a good thing.\"\n\nSeveral large-cap stocks have a big head start that could enable them to finish the year strong. I predict these will be the three best-performing S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stocks of 2024.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) currently ranks as the biggest year-to-date winner in the S&P 500. Shares of the GPU maker have skyrocketed over 150%. I don't think Nvidia will give up its top spot by the end of 2024.\n\nOn Aug. 12, I predicted that Nvidia stock would jump another 20% or more by year-end. My prediction has almost come true already. One reason why is that some of the factors weighing on Nvidia aren't as worrisome now.\n\nMore importantly, though, Nvidia has yet to announce its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results. The company is scheduled to provide its Q2 update on Aug. 28. I fully expect another blow-out quarter for Nvidia, which will fuel investor optimism.\n\nI also think the company will reassure investors about the timing of the launch of its Blackwell-based chips. Blackwell is Nvidia's newest GPU architecture that CEO Jensen Huang believes will be the most successful product in the company's history.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly referred to as Supermicro, ranks as the S&P 500's second-best stock so far this year. Shares of the information technology infrastructure company have soared around 115%. I expect Supermicro will add to that gain over the next few months.\n\nWill Supermicro's upcoming 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 1 provide a big catalyst? Maybe, but I wouldn't count on it. Even if there is a boost from the split, it could only be a temporary one.\n\nThe smarter reason to look for a continued strong performance from Supermicro is the tailwind generated by artificial intelligence (AI). In the fourth quarter of Supermicro's fiscal 2024, the company generated revenue of $5.31 billion. It projects revenue of between $6 billion and $7 billion in fiscal 2025 Q1. That's a 22% increase in just three months -- and much of it stems from AI-related demand.\n\nSupermicro could also benefit from Nvidia's launch of its Blackwell chips. Even if there's a worse-than-expected delay with this launch, though, Supermicro CEO Charles Liang doesn't think his company will be affected too much because of the overall demand for its liquid-cooling solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Eli Lilly\n\nI'm going out on a limb with my next pick. Three S&P 500 stocks are currently performing better than Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) in addition to Nvidia and Supermicro. However, I have a hunch this big pharma stock could leap past them to end the year as the No. 3 stock in the S&P.\n\nMy bullish view about Lilly is based largely on my great expectations for the company's tirzepatide franchise. In the U.S., the drug is marketed under the brand name Mounjaro for treating type 2 diabetes and under the brand name Zepbound for treating obesity. Outside the U.S., it's marketed as Mounjaro for both indications. Whatever you call it, tirzepatide is already an enormously successful blockbuster drug. Mounjaro raked in $3.09 billion in sales in Q2, while Zepbound made $1.24 billion.\n\nInvestors also know that Lilly could have more indications for tirzepatide on the way. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could make an approval decision on the drug in treating obstructive sleep apnea and obesity by the end of 2024. Lilly plans to file for regulatory approvals of tirzepatide in treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity later this year.\n\nWe can't overlook Lilly's recently FDA-approved Alzheimer's disease drug, Kisunla. I don't look for jaw-dropping sales numbers from the therapy in the second half of the year. However, more regulatory approvals outside the U.S. are possible by the end of 2024. And if U.S. sales are better than expected, Kisunla could provide more reason for investors to be excited about Lilly's growth prospects.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia's Stock Has Soared 30% Since It Announced Its 10-for-1 Stock Split. History Says This Will Happen Next.",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) craze has powered the stock market higher this year, and few companies have benefited from that more than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). In the months since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, eliciting a tidal wave of demand for AI-capable hardware, the chipmaker's share price has surged by 800%\n\nNvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, and it could deliver a repeat performance in 2024. It is once again leading the S&P 500, and its gains year-to-date exceed those of second-place Vistra by 34 percentage points.\n\nNvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split in May and completed it in June to \"make stock ownership more accessible for employees and investors.\" But based on historical patterns, Nvidia shares could decline in the coming months.\n\nHistorically, stock-split stocks have outperformed the S&P 500\n\nStocks that split typically outperform the S&P 500, at least temporarily. Since 2010, such companies' shares have appreciated by 18% on average during the 12-month period after their stock split announcements, according to Bank of America. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 returned an average of 13% annually during the same period.\n\nWe can apply that information to Nvidia to speculate about its future performance. Specifically, its shares have advanced by 30% since Nvidia announced in May that a stock split was coming. So based on the broad averages, that leaves it with implied downside of 12% through May 2025. However, the outlook is considerably worse if we use company-specific data.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia shares have performed poorly following stock splits\n\nPrior to the most recent one, Nvidia conducted five stock splits since it went public at $12 per share on Jan. 22, 1999. Generally speaking, those events were bad news for shareholders in the short term, as detailed in the table below.\n\nStock Split Date 12-Month Return 24-Month Return June 2000 28% (52%) September 2001 (72%) (49%) April 2006 1% (6%) September 2007 (70%) (53%) July 2021 (4%) 145% Average (23%) (3%)\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nNvidia shares have declined by an average of 23% during the 12-month periods following past stock splits, and shares were still down by 3% on average 24 months after.\n\nThe chipmaker completed its most recent split after the market closed on June 7, and shares began trading at a split-adjusted price of $120.37 on June 10. The stock has returned 2% since then, leaving it with an implied downside of 25% through June 2025, and implied downside of 5% through June 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future results, but investors should be especially cautious about extrapolating historical data in this situation. I say that because most of Nvidia's past stock splits took place within 12 months of a recession, and all of them took place within 24 months of a recession. Few stocks generate positive returns during economic downturns.\n\nNvidia's second-quarter earnings release will be a high-stakes event\n\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), powerful chips that can perform many types of calculations faster and more efficiently than central processing units (CPUs). GPUs are particularly well suited to computing tasks like rendering graphics, training machine learning models, and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nNvidia dominates those markets. According to a study by the analysts at TechInsights, it accounted for 98% of data center GPU shipments last year, and its market share in AI processors ranges from 70% to 95%, according to analysts. But the company is truly formidable because it offers a full-stack computing platform that spans hardware, software, and services. That makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for AI.\n\nIt reported excellent financial results in its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 28). Revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion amid unprecedented demand for generative AI chips and networking hardware. Meanwhile, non-GAAP earnings surged by 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. Those numbers soundly beat Wall Street's estimates.\n\nThe company will report second-quarter results on Aug. 28, and Wall Street's expectations are sky-high. Analysts anticipate revenue and non-GAAP earnings increases of 112% and 137%, respectively. That would make Q2 its fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage growth on the top and bottom lines. Additionally, management will likely address rumors that shipments of its next-generation Blackwell GPUs will be delayed.\n\nThe combination of elevated expectations and uncertainty surrounding the Blackwell GPUs means the upcoming earnings release will be a high-stakes event for Nvidia shareholders. Indeed, options pricing data implies 11% price action, meaning that data suggests the share price could increase or decrease by that much in the trading session that follows the report.\n\nThat puts investors in a tricky position. Would they be smarter to buy shares now and risk losses, or buy shares later and risk missing gains? The most prudent course of action would be to split the difference. Investors interested in adding Nvidia shares to their portfolios can buy a small position today, provided they are comfortable with volatility. Then, if shares decline substantially post-earnings, they can consider adding to their position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: On Aug. 28, This Figure From Nvidia Will Confirm an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bubble That's in the Early Stages of Bursting",
        "content": "Since 2023 began, no trend has been more responsible for lifting Wall Street's major stock indexes to new heights than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe allure of AI is the long-term capacity for software and systems to learn without human intervention. This gives AI-driven software and systems the ability to become more efficient at their tasks, and potentially evolve to learn new skills. With an addressable market that spans most sectors and industries, the analysts at PwC believe AI can add a jaw-dropping $15.7 trillion to the global economy come 2030.\n\nAlthough dozens of companies have benefited from the AI revolution, none has been the poster child of success more so than semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is leading the next supposed leap forward in business innovation\n\nIn short order, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) became the go-to chip used by businesses to run generative AI solutions and train large language models (LLMs). With demand swamping supply, Nvidia has had no trouble meaningfully increasing the price of its H100 GPUs to between $30,000 and $40,000 per chip, or roughly two to three times what key rivals are charging for their AI-data center hardware.\n\nThe beauty of higher price points is that they have directly benefited Nvidia's bottom line. Over the previous five reported fiscal quarters, ended April 28, 2024, the company's adjusted gross margin has increased by close to 14 percentage points to 78.35%.\n\nNvidia hasn't been shy about investing for the future, either. Its next-generation Blackwell platform, which is slated to hit the market next year, will accelerate computing capacity in six areas, including quantum computing and generative AI, and be more energy efficient than its predecessor. Meanwhile, in June, CEO Jensen Huang briefly teased the all-new Rubin GPU architecture, which will run on a different processor (known as Vera) and debut in 2026.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle that's helped Nvidia's market cap grow by more than $2.8 trillion since the start of 2023 is its CUDA platform. This is the software platform developers use to build LLMs, and it's working hand-in-hand with the company's leading hardware to keep enterprise clients loyal to its ecosystem of solutions.\n\nAlthough it's been a seemingly perfect operating ramp, Wall Street is liable to see just how fallible Nvidia and AI as a technology are as a whole on Aug. 28.\n\nThis all-important figure from Nvidia could signal the bursting of the AI bubble\n\nThis coming Wednesday, Aug. 28, Wall Street's AI darling will lift the hood on its fiscal second-quarter operating results.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the previous five quarters, Nvidia has done nothing short of obliterate even the loftiest analyst expectations. A combination of strong enterprise demand for its AI-GPUs, exceptional pricing power, and limited competition, has allowed the company to build up a backlog that would make any tech company envious.\n\nHowever, headline revenue and profit figures aren't going to tell the complete story come Aug. 28. Even if sales and profits sail past the consensus of analysts, another key figure can portend the end to AI euphoria. I'm talking about Nvidia's adjusted gross margin. Nvidia's \"adjusted\" gross margin excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, and a few other costs. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFollowing the release of Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter results, Huang and his team offered adjusted gross margin guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points). This guidance implies a 235- to 335-basis-point decline from the first quarter.\n\nWhile a median expected drop of 285 basis points in adjusted gross margin might sound like much ado about nothing considering the roughly 1,370 basis points Nvidia's adjusted gross margin expanded by over the prior five quarters, it's the reasons behind this forecast decline that are the real concern.\n\nNvidia's compute advantages are unlikely to save it from the inevitable\n\nAlthough demand has been undeniably strong for Nvidia's H100 GPU, it's the company's pricing power that's done most of the heavy lifting. Sales growth has handily outpaced an increase in cost of revenue, signaling that pricing power, fueled by persistent AI-GPU scarcity, is the company's core driver.\n\nThe problem for Nvidia is that it's not the only show in town. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPUs, which are, on average, 50% to 75% cheaper than Nvidia's H100. AMD also hasn't been hindered by early stage chip fabrication supplier issues in the same way Nvidia has.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four-largest customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), Amazon, and Alphabet -- are all internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Even with these internally developed chips destined for complementary roles, they're ultimately cheaper and more easily accessible than Nvidia's hardware. These companies represent about 40% of Nvidia's sales, and they're all signaling a reduced future reliance on Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nTo make matters worse, reports emerged a little over two weeks ago that Nvidia's prized Blackwell chip would be delayed by \"at least three months\" due to design flaws and supplier constraints. Nvidia not being able to meet enterprise demand in a timely manner opens the door for AMD, Samsung, and Huawei to steal share.\n\nNvidia's biggest gross margin lift has come from AI-GPUs being extremely scarce. But as new chips hit the market, and the company's own top customers fill their valuable data center \"real estate\" with in-house chips, Nvidia will inevitably find that its pristine pricing power is eroding. The company's median forecast of a 285-basis-point sequential-quarter drop in adjusted gross margin is evidence that AI euphoria is fading. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen the AI bubble bursts, no company will likely be hit harder than Nvidia\n\nLooking beyond Nvidia's Aug. 28 report, history is another monkey wrench for the AI revolution.\n\nSince the advent of the internet three decades ago, there hasn't been a single innovation, technology, or buzzy trend with a mammoth addressable market that's avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event. Without exception, investors always overestimate the use case(s) and consumer/enterprise uptake of a new technology or trend, which eventually leads to disappointment, euphoria fading, and a bubble-bursting event.\n\nIncluding the internet, we've watched this play out with genome decoding, business-to-business commerce and networking, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cryptocurrency, cannabis, blockchain technology, virtual/augmented reality, and the metaverse.\n\nTo add to the point, you'll find that few of the companies building out AI data centers have definitive plans for how they're going to use the technology to increase sales and profits. For instance, Meta Platforms is investing more than $10 billion in Nvidia's H100 GPUs, but has no immediate plans to profit from these investments in its AI data center.\n\nThe simple fact that most businesses lack a clear game plan when it comes to AI makes it crystal clear that we're dealing with the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nThis isn't to say that artificial intelligence can't, eventually (key word!), change the growth arc in a big way for corporate America -- but there's little question that the technology will need time to mature.\n\nIf the AI bubble does burst, as history suggests it will, there isn't a company that'll be hit harder than Nvidia. It's adjusted gross margin in the coming week should provide confirmation that the beginning of this bubble-bursting event is underway.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "In the world of finance, 10 years is the blink of an eye. Want proof? Take a close look at the table below:\n\nCompany 2014 Market Cap (in billions) 2024 Market Cap (in billions) IBM $182 $178 Nvidia $10 $2,965\n\nIn August 2014, IBM's market cap was roughly 18 times larger than Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA). But oh, how the tables have turned. Today, Nvidia boasts a market cap of about $3 trillion -- roughly 17 times larger than IBM.\n\nSo, looking ahead to the next 10 years, what are the companies that could surpass Apple's enormous market cap? Here are two that could pull it off. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nIf a company is going to surpass Apple over the next decade, it will need a gigantic market cap. Even assuming Apple's market cap holds steady, that would mean a company would need to reach a market cap of $3.4 trillion to catch Apple.\n\nThat's a very tall order, and there are only so many companies that could do it. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of them.\n\nFor starters, Microsoft already has a market cap of $3.1 trillion as of this writing.As recently as June, Microsoft did have a market cap larger than Apple. What's more, Microsoft holds a few competitive advantages that should, over time, help the company's market cap ease past Apple.\n\nFirst, Microsoft has a more diversified business. The company has its hands in cloud computing, gaming, advertising, hardware, software, social networking, and artificial intelligence (AI). In short, Microsoft has many pathways to success. Apple, on the other hand, has traditionally benefited from its excellent hardware innovation. And while Apple services and AI could boost the company's revenue, flagging iPhone sales could present a real challenge to Apple over the next decade.\n\nIn my book, that means an advantage for Microsoft.\n\nNvidia\n\nI have reservations about Nvidia right now. Its sky-high valuation makes it vulnerable to a nasty correction if the company's sales show any signs of slowing. That said, this article is about what could happen over the next 10 years. And in that case, I think Nvidia is well positioned to surpass Apple.\n\nThat's because Nvidia's core business -- making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that will power cutting-edge AI systems for the next decade -- is on a long-term growth trajectory that Apple simply can't match.\n\nSales of Apple's signature product -- the iPhone -- grew every year between 2007 and 2015, but they've been flat since then. Image source: Statista.\n\nNvidia, on the other hand, is still growing. Over the last two years, the company has tripled its revenue as GPUs have sold like hotcakes. That growth isn't likely to slow in the next few years. Most analysts expect Nvidia's sales to double again to around $160 billion by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, there are likely to be some bumps in the road as the competitors take some market share from Nvidia in the red-hot AI chips market. But even if Nvidia's sales growth slows, it could easily close the $500 billion market cap difference between it and Apple over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 148%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "One of the more interesting developments in the investing space over the past several years is the reemergence of stock splits. The once-common practice had diminished in popularity but has experienced a renaissance in recent years. Companies will generally take this path after years of strong results make the stock price less accessible to everyday investors. A stock split creates more shares trading at a lower price; it doesn't change a company's market cap.\n\nNewton's first law of motion states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. That same principle could easily be applied to investing in successful companies. Those that enact stock splits see share price increases of 25%, on average, in the year following the announcement, compared with 12% gains for the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard.\n\nHere are three stock-split stocks with as much as 148% upside ahead, according to certain Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 62%\n\nArguably, the most celebrated stock-split stock in recent memory is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and the chipmaker still has a boatload of potential. It's the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) used to zip data through the ether for data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). This business has eclipsed its humble roots generating lifelike images in video games.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 262% year over year to $26 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) that soared 629% to $5.98. The results were driven by data center revenue -- which includes cloud and AI chips -- as revenue for the segment rose 427% to $22.6 billion. That marked the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit sales and profit gains.\n\nIt's little wonder that results of that magnitude have supercharged Nvidia's stock price, which has gained nearly 800% since the start of 2023, resulting in its high-profile 10-for-1 stock split in June. However, some on Wall Street believe that's just the tip of the iceberg. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintains a buy rating on Nvidia and a Street-high price target of $200, which represents potential upside of 62% compared to Thursday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst cites Nvidia's accelerated development cycle and track record of innovation as evidence there's more upside to come. \"We see Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Rubin series driving 'value' market share in one of Silicon Valley's most successful silicon/platform product cycles,\" Mosesmann wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe isn't alone in his bullish outlook. Of the 59 analysts who offered an opinion in July, 54 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nI believe the analyst hit the nail on the head. Nvidia's customers have reported they're ramping up capital expenditure spending on AI, which directly benefits Nvidia. Furthermore, partners have reported bullish results, which suggests the AI revolution is ongoing. To me, this is compelling evidence that Nvidia stock has further to climb.\n\nMicroStrategy: Implied upside 61%\n\nThe second stock-split stock with significant upside is MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR), which split its stock earlier this month. The company provides subscription-based AI-fueled business analytics software that allows non-technical users to gain actionable insights from their data. MicroStrategy also provides cloud-based services to government entities.\n\nWhat sets the company apart, however, is its Bitcoin strategy, which is really turning heads. MicroStrategy bills itself as \"the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the world's first Bitcoin development company.\"\n\nFor the second quarter, subscription services revenue climbed 21% year over year, though total revenue declined by 7%, and its operating loss increased more than sevenfold. However, MicroStrategy made much more progress on the Bitcoin front, increasing its holdings to 226,500 Bitcoins, worth more than $13 billion as of this writing, well ahead of its cost basis of $8.3 billion.\n\nDespite the company's risky strategy, some on Wall Street remain bullish. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer has a buy rating on MicroStrategy, with a split-adjusted, Street-high price target of $215. That represents potential upside of 61% compared to Thursday's closing price. The analyst says that while the company has its detractors, since adopting its Bitcoin strategy four years ago, MicroStrategy's stock price has soared nearly 1,000%, far outpacing the returns of Bitcoin itself, which has gained 413%. This no doubt played into the company's 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month.\n\nWall Street is clearly in agreement. Of the seven analysts who covered the stock in July, every one rated it a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFor investors who believe that Bitcoin will hold its value and continue to gain ground over time, MicroStrategy's strategy is sheer brilliance. However, it's important to remember that as recently as late 2022, Bitcoin lost as much as 75% of its value. An investment in MicroStrategy could be equally volatile.\n\nI believe MicroStrategy offers a compelling opportunity for investors with an appetite for some volatility and a long investing time horizon. That said, I also believe there's a certain degree of risk and that MicroStrategy should represent a small part of a balanced portfolio.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside 148%\n\nThe last of my trio of stock-split stocks with a boatload of potential is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The company is one of the premier providers of custom servers in the industry, backed by more than three decades of experience.\n\nSupermicro made the jump to the big leagues thanks to robust demand from those wanting to join the AI revolution. However, it was the company's building-block architecture, energy efficiency, and direct liquid cooling that boosted demand for its rack-scale servers, as the devices could be customized to the user's needs while still providing power efficiency and withstanding the harsh demands needed to run AI models.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), Supermicro reported record revenue that soared 143% year over year to $5.3 billion, which marked an increase of 38% sequentially. This generated adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 78% to $6.25. This marked the company's third consecutive quarter of triple-digit gains.\n\nSupermicro's consistently robust growth has sent its stock price into the stratosphere, delivering gains of 637% since early last year, which likely factored into the company's decision to announce a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month.\n\nWall Street believes there's more upside ahead. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah is among the biggest bulls, with a buy rating on the stock and a Street high price target of $1,500. That represents potential gains for investors of 148% compared to Thursday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes Supermicro has much greater sales potential than Wall Street is giving the company credit for, estimating its revenue run rate will climb to $40 billion by the end of fiscal 2026. For context, Supermicro generated revenue of less than $15 billion in fiscal 2024. The analyst's forecast also aligns closely with management's guidance, which calls for net sales of roughly $28 billion for fiscal 2025.\n\nWall Street seems to agree. Of the 17 analysts who covered the stock in July, 11 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nI'm completely on board with this analyst's take. The company continues to take market share from its larger rivals, further accelerating its growth, and has a pole position in the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Q2 earnings season has effectively come to an end, with results from more than 95% of S&P 500 members already out, with even most of the major Retail sector results known by now. That said, this week’s line-up of quarterly results from more than 140 companies, including 15 from S&P 500 members, includes quarterly results from the only Magnificent 7 member yet to report results, Nvidia NVDA.\n\nOther notable companies reporting results this week include Salesforce CRM, Lululemon LULU, Best Buy BBY and others.\n\nNvidia has established itself as a true leader of the coming artificial intelligence (AI) economy, with the company’s chips as the only game in town when it comes to running the highly complex and demanding computations. This leadership has allowed Nvidia to consistently come out with beat-and-raise quarterly reports in recent quarters.\n\nWe will see if the company can maintain this operating momentum when it reports results after the market’s close on Wednesday, August 28th. Estimates for the period have essentially remained unchanged in recent weeks, which is unusual relative to what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.\n\nNvidia is expected to bring in $0.63 in EPS on $28.2 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year gains of +133.3% and +109%, respectively. You can see the long-term Nvidia revisions trend in the below Price, Consensus & Surprise chart. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia shares were hit hard in the market’s recent down draft, but have effectively recouped most of those losses. The stock has more than doubled this year and handily outperformed the Zacks Tech sector, the broader market, and the Mag 7 stocks, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe biggest driver of the stock’s performance from here onwards will be management guidance for the current and upcoming quarters, as well as the market’s assessment of the company’s ability to ramp up production of the Blackwell chips. There have been speculations in the market that Nvidia is faced with production snags that can delay the product’s delivery schedule.\n\nWith the stock up more than +150% this year alone, most investors will assume that valuation must be really stretched already. The actual ground reality is not that simple.\n\nNvidia shares are currently trading at 40.2X forward 12-month EPS estimates. This is almost double the comparable multiple for the S&P 500 index of 21.5X. Over the last five years, Nvidia shares have traded as high as 106.3X forward 12-month estimates, as low as 26.8X, and have a 5-year median of 50.7X.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother way to look at Nvidia's valuation is to look at the magnitude of the premium the stock is currently enjoying relative to where that premium or discount has historically been.\n\nNvidia’s current forward 12-month P/E multiple is 187% of the S&P 500 multiple. Over the last five years, the stock’s multiple has been as high as 569% and as low as 134%, with a median over this period of 248%.\n\nIn other words, the stock isn’t cheap, but it has traded at higher multiples over its history. Prediction is very difficult, particularly if it’s about the future, as someone wise once opined. Predictions for Nvidia shares require how sustainable the company’s competitive advantages are in the coming AI revolution, not to mention whether the ongoing all-around AI optimism has a solid foundation.\n\nNvidia aside, the earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector. To that end, we will be getting results this week from Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and a few other retailers.\n\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 30 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 30 retailers account for 97.3% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\n\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor’s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players.\n\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 30 retailers that have reported are up +17.3% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues, with 63.3% beating EPS estimates and only 46.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see above, the Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentages for these players is the low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years), and the EPS beats percentage isn’t that far from the low-point either.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor.\n\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower-end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week’s Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 23rd, we have seen Q2 results from 478 S&P 500 members, or 95.6% of the index’s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 79.9% beating EPS estimates and only 60.3% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nAs noted earlier, we have over 140 companies on deck to report Q2 results this week, including 15 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week, besides the aforementioned Nvidia, include Salesforce, Lululemon, Best Buy, Dollar General, and others.\n\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 60.3% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the few still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.6% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\n\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.9% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +3.9% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8% on +1.8% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -11.8% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.6%.\n\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.2% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index-level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.5% on an ex-Finance basis.

        "title": "'Super Bowl' Nvidia earnings stand to test searing AI trade",
        "content": "By David Randall\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The rally in U.S. stocks faces an important test next week with earnings from chipmaking giant Nvidia, whose blistering run has powered markets throughout 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 has pared a sharp drop it suffered after U.S. economic worries contributed to a sell-off at the beginning of the month and again stands near a fresh all-time high.\n\nNvidia, whose chips are widely seen as the gold standard in artificial intelligence, has been at the forefront of that rally, jumping by more than 30% since its recent lows. The stock is up some 150% year-to-date, accounting for around a quarter of the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date gain.\n\nThe company’s Aug. 28 earnings report, coupled with guidance on whether it expects corporate investments in AI to continue, could be a key inflection point for market sentiment heading into what is historically a volatile time of the year. The S&P 500 has fallen in September by an average of 0.78% since World War Two, the worst performance of any month, according to CFRA data.\n\n\"Nvidia is the zeitgeist stock today,\" said Mike Smith, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, which holds the company's shares in its portfolios. \"You can think of their earnings four times a year as the Super Bowl.\"\n\nSome investors are getting ready for fireworks. Traders are pricing in a swing of around 10.3% in Nvidia’s shares the day after the company reports earnings, according to data from options analytic firm ORATS. That's larger than the expected move ahead of any Nvidia report over the last three years and well above the stock's average post-earnings move of 8.1% over that same period, ORATS data showed.\n\nThe results come at the end of an earnings season during which investors have taken a less forgiving view of big tech companies whose earnings failed to justify rich valuations or prodigious spending on AI. Examples include Microsoft, Tesla and Alphabet, whose shares are all down since their July reports.\n\nNvidia’s valuations have also climbed, as the stock soared about 750% since the start of 2023, making it the world’s third-most valuable company as of Thursday, while also drawing comparisons to the dotcom bubble of more than two decades ago. The company’s shares trade at about 37 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared with a 20-year average of 29 times, according to LSEG Datastream.\n\nMarket sentiment could depend as much on Nvidia's guidance as its results. Evidence that it sees robust demand will be a bullish sign that companies are continuing to invest rather than pull back in anticipation of an economic slowdown, said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager, equities, at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's \"connection to the largest companies in the U.S. stock market makes this a must-watch event,\" he said. \"The biggest piece that investors want to know is whether there is sustainability and what demand will look like in '25 and '26,\" he said.\n\nThe trajectory of monetary policy and the U.S. economy also looms large for investors. In a Friday morning speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered an explicit endorsement of interest rate cuts, saying further cooling in the job market would be unwelcome.\n\nInvestors will be watching U.S. labor market data on Sept. 6 for evidence of whether last month’s unexpected downshift in employment carried over to August. Signs that employment is continuing to weaken could bring back the recession fears that rocked markets earlier this month.\n\nA tight presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican former President Donald Trump may also whip up market uncertainty in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe August surge in stocks may make it difficult for markets to make much more headway in the near term even if Nvidia’s earnings impress Wall Street, said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which holds shares of the chipmaker.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at 21 times expected earnings, far above its long-term average of 15.7.\n\n\"The stock market as a whole is still trading at stretched valuations so the bar remains high,\" Belton said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The hidden reason AI costs are soaring—and it’s not because Nvidia chips are more expensive",
        "content": "Building today’s massive AI models can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, with projections suggesting it could hit a staggering billion dollars within a few years. Much of that expense is for computing power from specialized chips—typically Nvidia GPUs, of which tens of thousands may be required, costing as much as $30,000 each.\n\nBut companies training AI models, or fine-tuning existing models to improve performance on specific tasks, also struggle with another often overlooked and rising cost: data labeling. This is a painstaking process in which generative AI models are trained with data that is affixed with tags so that the model can recognize and interpret patterns.\n\nData labeling has long been used to develop AI models for self-driving cars, for example. A camera captures images of pedestrians, street signs, cars, and traffic lights and human annotators label the images with words like “pedestrian,” “truck,” or “stop sign.” The labor-intensive process has also raised ethics concerns. After releasing ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI was widely criticized for outsourcing the data labeling work that helped make the chatbot less toxic to Kenyans earning less than $2 hourly.\n\nToday’s generic large language models (LLMs) go through an exercise related to data labeling called Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback, in which humans provide qualitative feedback or rankings on what the model produces. That is one significant source of rising costs, as is the effort involved in labeling private data that companies want to incorporate into their AI models, such as customer information or internal corporate data.\n\nIn addition, labeling highly technical, expert-level data in fields like legal, finance, and healthcare is driving up expenses. That’s because some companies are hiring high-cost doctors, lawyers, PhDs, and scientists to label certain data or outsourcing the work to third-party companies such as Scale AI, which recently secured a jaw-dropping $1 billion in funding as its CEO predicted strong revenue growth by year-end.\n\n“You now need a lawyer to label stuff, [which is] a crazy use of legal hours,” said William Falcon, CEO of AI development platform Lightning AI. “Anything high stakes” requires expert-level labeling, he explained. “A chat with a ‘virtual BFF is not high stakes, providing legal advice is.”\n\nAlex Ratner, CEO of data labeling startup Snorkel AI, says corporate customers can spend millions of dollars on data labeling and other data tasks, which can eat up 80% of their time and AI budget. Over time, data must also be relabeled to remain up to date, he added.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatt Shumer, CEO and cofounder of AI assistant startup Otherside AI, agreed that fine tuning LLMs has gotten expensive. “Over the past couple of years, we’ve gone from middle-school-level data being okay to needing high school, college, and now expert,” he said. “That obviously doesn’t come cheap.”\n\nThat can create budget woes for tech startups building in important areas like healthcare. Neal Shah, CEO of CareYaya, a platform for elder caregivers, says his company received a grant from Johns Hopkins University to build “the world's first AI caregiver trainer for dementia patients,” but that data labeling costs are “eating us alive.” The cost, he said, has skyrocketed 40% over the past year because of the specialized information needed from gerontologists, dementia experts, and veteran caregivers. He’s working to reduce those costs by enlisting healthcare students and college professors to do the labeling.\n\nBob Rogers, CEO of Oii.ai, a data science company specializing in supply chain modeling, said he has seen data labeling projects that cost millions. Platforms like BeeKeeper AI, he said, can help lower costs by letting multiple companies share experts, data, and algorithms without exposing their private data to the others.\n\nKjell Carlsson, head of AI strategy at Domino Data Lab, added that some companies are lowering costs by using “synthetic” data—or data generated by the AI itself—to at least partially automate data collection and labeling. In some cases, models can fully automate any data labeling. For example, biopharma companies are training generative AI models for developing synthetic proteins for conditions like colo-rectal cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. The companies automatically conduct experiments based on the outputs of generative AI models, which provide new training data that comes with labels.\n\nThe bottom line, however, is that data labeling may be costly and time-intensive, but well worth it. “Data labeling's a beast,” said CareYaya’s Shah. “But the potential payoff is massive.”\n\nSharon Goldman\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "title": "Nvidia Q2 results will be ‘the most important tech earnings in years’, predicts tech bull Ives",
        "content": "Investors need to mark Wednesday in fat red ink on their calendar for next week that could ultimately prove far more important than Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole.\n\nWedbush Securities’ Dan Ives, one of the most influential tech bulls on Wall Street, just began the figurative drumroll in anticipation of Nvidia’s quarterly results expected for Aug. 28. Only don’t confuse these with your run-of-the mill update to investors: according to Ives, they are nothing less than the \"most important tech earnings in years.\"\n\nIn his view, the tech bull market lives and dies on whether underlying demand in new data center capacity—needed to operate OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example—remains robust as ever. A miss and markets could easily see a repeat of the turbulence around Aug. 5, a day likened to 1987’s Black Monday, even if Powell signaled today that rates will start to fall.\n\nAnd that all comes down to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. His state-of-the-art graphics processors, once used to power video games, now fuel the AI gold rush thanks to their ability to perform computations in parallel, rather than in sequence like most central processors. Once networked together in massive compute clusters, they become powerful neural networks without which generative AI is not possible.\n\n“There is one company in the world that is the foundation for the AI Revolution,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “And that is Nvidia with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia’s AI chips looking forward.”\n\nRumored delays for next-gen AI training chip 'Blackwell'\n\nWith investors like hedge fund Elliott Management warning Nvidia’s valuations are in bubble territory, the market will parse the report for even the slightest sign that demand for its benchmark H100 processors might be softening. Huang’s company is estimated to control 90% of the AI training chip segment.\n\nEqually as important will be any comments Huang has on the transition from the current Hopper chips to the next-generation Blackwell architecture, led by the upcoming B200 chip. A report from The Information earlier this month suggested that there might be delays, a risk that could ripple through the entire AI food chain.\n\nCharles Liang, the CEO of data center hardware provider Super Micro Computer, has already tempered his fiscal year revenue expectations as a result.\n\nThis speculation came hard on the news that major customers such as Elon Musk are investing in contingency plans in case they have difficulty getting their hands on Nvidia chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nMusk said last month that Tesla, hot in pursuit of a breakthrough in autonomous driving, is doubling down on its own custom AI silicon. These chips are designed specifically with vision (rather than text) machine learning in mind, but Musk has been careful not to overstate progress.\n\nIves predicts 'another masterpiece' from Nvidia's Huang\n\nShould Huang confirm that customers are continuing to line up for every last chip he can sell, bulls like Ives will likely feel confirmed in their thesis the AI party is only just beginning—or, as he puts it, the market is reliving the 1995 dotcom boom, not the 1999 dotcom crash.\n\nBy his estimate, then, market valuations are still very much in the phase where a youthful, shaggy-haired Marc Andreessen first took Netscape public. We haven’t gotten to the AI equivalent of Pets.com quite yet.\n\n“The stage is set for tech stocks to move higher,” Ives added, predicting “another masterpiece quarter” from Nvidia.\n\nCome Wednesday, investors should have a better idea whether Wedbush or Elliott made the right call.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia: The Path to $10 Trillion",
        "content": "Semiconductor and AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company’s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\n\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week’s earnings report and whether it’s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHow Did Nvidia Stock Get Here?\n\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia’s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\n\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia’s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock’s unprecedented rally.\n\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It’s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\n\nNvidia Earnings Estimates\n\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out to the expectations are equally impressive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn’t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven’t been upgraded recently. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCan Nvidia Reach $10 trillion?\n\nIt isn’t just possible, it’s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\n\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShould Investors Buy Shares in Nvidia?\n\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company’s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\n\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company’s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet and Meta Platforms Just Sent a Major Warning to Nvidia Shareholders",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming spending on artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key piece of infrastructure for training and running large language models, the backbone of generative AI. Big tech companies like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on as many Nvidia GPUs as possible right now.\n\nThat's been great for Nvidia and its shareholders. Sales more than tripled in its fiscal first quarter, reaching a record $26 billion in total revenue. But that kind of growth can't last forever.\n\nAnalysts expect more modest sales growth of \"just\" 38.4% next year. But some comments from Nvidia's biggest customers suggest that number might be too high. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's biggest customers just admitted they're overspending on AI\n\nWhile Nvidia has seen its profits soar as a result of all the AI spending, the same isn't necessarily true of a lot of its biggest customers. A step up in capital expenditures like those required to build AI data centers can be a crunch on cash flow. That's especially true if those investments don't produce an immediate impact on revenue.\n\nThat's the challenge for cloud providers that rent computing infrastructure to developers. The three largest cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. If a developer comes to one of them and needs access to compute power they don't have, it will go to one of its competitors. As a result, they need to build data centers fast enough amid the current AI boom to ensure when a new customer comes to them, or an existing customer asks for more capacity, they can serve them.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made this clear when asked about spending on AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here,\" he told analysts. In other words, he's intentionally overspending right now to ensure he gets as many customers as possible. Microsoft and Amazon are likely taking a similar approach.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is building its own data center capacity to support its AI development. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has ambitions of turning Meta into the leading AI company in the world. And that requires having the infrastructure in place before the company's software is ready for training and deployment.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,\" he said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\n\nHis comments echo Pichai's. Meta is spending now with the expectation that it will grow into its capacity. At some point, however, it will rightsize its data centers. At that point, it will significantly slow down its spending on servers and chips like Nvidia's.\n\nThese comments hold a lot of weight (on Nvidia's income statement)\n\nThe reason Nvidia shareholders should pay attention to everything Pichai, Zuckerberg, and a few other big-tech executives say about their AI spending is that the business has become heavily concentrated on those customers.\n\nTwenty-four percent of Nvidia's total sales in the first quarter came from just two customers. Between 60% and 70% of its revenue comes from just 10 customers, according to Seligman Investments analyst Paul Wick.\n\nWith all that revenue highly concentrated among just a handful of customers, a single change in the capital expenditure policy at one of them could drastically impact Nvidia's results. If Alphabet or Meta decide to cut back on spending in a couple of years after aggressively building capacity, Nvidia will see its growth slow considerably.\n\nThe stock is in a precarious position, with Nvidia shares trading at valuation multiples, with around 50x forward earnings and 40x enterprise value to revenue. If it continues to outperform management's guidance and analysts' expectations, the stock will continue zooming higher. But one quarter of poor results could send shares reeling. The comments from Alphabet and Meta suggest it may be only a matter of time before there's a stark pullback in AI spending.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Technology giant Nvidia is set to reveal another surge in profits on the back of doubling revenues as it benefits from the rapid adoption of generative AI (artificial intelligence).\n\nThe chip firm, which is currently the world’s second largest listed company behind Microsoft, has seen its share price surge more than 160% since the start of the year as investors banked on continued growth for its AI and data centre businesses.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia will update shareholders and analysts over its trading performance for its second quarter to the end of July.\n\nThey will be hoping for another blockbuster set of results, after the firm delivered a strong first quarter.\n\nRevenues shot up 262% to 26 billion dollars in the quarter to April, rising beyond the industry forecasts laid out in its previous update.\n\nNvidia’s growth was supported by the rapid growth of its data centre business, which includes the development of its H100 graphics cards which are widely used to power generative AI apps, such as ChatGPT.\n\nIn the first quarter, data centre revenues were more than five times larger than the same period a year earlier as a result.\n\nAn analyst consensus compiled by Zacks Investment Research forecast that overall group revenues are likely to be 109% higher for the second quarter as AI-related growth continued to support the business.\n\nAarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Analysts are expecting this momentum to continue into next week’s results.\n\n“The likes of Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft are all customers, each with deep pockets and a desire to build out their AI offerings with the power of Nvidia’s market-leading chips.\n\n“That’s underpinning the market’s view that second-quarter revenue and operating profits can more than double to 28.6 billion dollars (£21.8 billion) and 18.7 billion dollars (£14.3 billion) respectively.”\n\nThe analyst said he believes these projections look “achievable”, with investors therefore likely to have a particularly keen eye on its outlook for the rest of the year.\n\nAnalysts at AJ Bell said Nvidia has “demolished consensus estimates and raised guidance for each of the past five quarters”, and agreed that investors will be looking for a steer on what the remainder of the year will look like.\n\nThey added that investors could be looking out for an update on reported delays in the launch of new AI chips, using its Blackwell architecture, with production due to be ramped up in the second half of this year.",

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Nvidia, Prudential, CrowdStrike and Foot Locker",
        "content": "Earnings season is winding down but investors will still have plenty to watch next week as key companies across various sectors provide updates that could offer valuable insights into market trends.\n\nIn the tech sector, AI darling Nvidia is expected to offer a glimpse into the ongoing impact of the artificial intelligence (AI) hype on the semiconductor industry, potentially revealing whether enthusiasm for AI is translating into tangible growth.\n\nMeanwhile in London, financial services firm Prudential will show investors if it has managed to turn around its performance. Shares in the company have slumped amid less than stellar performance of the Hong Kong and China economies.\n\nCrowdStrike will also report its results in the cybersecurity arena, with investors eager to see how the company behind the recent global outage is performing.\n\nIn the sneaker fashion world, Foot Locker is seeing analysts upgrading its stock ahead of earnings but Wall Street still expects a quarterly loss.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) — Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nAll eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA) next week, as the chip giant at the heart of the AI boom, is set to release its second-quarter results on 28 August.\n\nNot only does Nvidia hold an 80% to 95% share of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters, but it is also the world’s third-largest company by market capitalisation at $3.04tn (£2.31tn), having briefly held the top spot back in June.\n\nThe AI darling is the single best performer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index and a leading member of the Philadelphia Semiconductor index — known as the SOX (SOX=F) — point out AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst for the platform.\n\nNvidia is also part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven', which alongside other tech heavyweights including Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), is a group of stocks that make up more than a third of the S&P 500’s stock market value and a fifth of the FTSE All-World (AW01.FGI) equity index’s market capitalisation.\n\n“These seven names have gone a long way to helping equity markets go higher, so if they stumble then the effects could be felt widely,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nNvidia shares are up 149.87% year-to-date, though the stock sold off heavily in July and into early August. The share price has recovered some ground since then but fell 3% in yesterday’s trading session ahead of the highly anticipated earnings report next week.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks advance as UK energy price cap rises to £1,717\n\nStory continues\n\n“From a fundamental, earnings point of view, Nvidia has demolished consensus estimates and raised guidance for each of the past five quarters, which helps to explain its stellar share price performance,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nNvidia said it expects revenues of $28bn for the second-quarter, which is more than double the $13.5bn it reported for the same period last year. If Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offers any steer on the third quarter, Hewson and Coatsworth say the current consensus forecast on revenue is $30.7bn, versus $18.1bn for Q3 last year.\n\nBased on Huang’s guidance for gross margins, operating expenses and tax charges, Hewson and Coatsworth said this implies a net profit of $15bn for the second quarter, which is more than double the figure reported last year, but broadly flat on the previous quarter. They said this also suggests headline earnings per share (EPS) of $0.63 for Q2, up from $0.61 in the first quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, they said that analysts will be keeping an eye out for comments from Huang on reported delays in the launch of Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips.\n\n“Production of Blackwell was due to ramp up in the second half of this year, as Nvidia looks to maintain its technological lead by quickly improving upon the Hopper chipset,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.\n\nPrudential (PRU.L) — Reports first-half results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nAnother company reporting on Wednesday is financial services firm Prudential, which has seen its shares fall by nearly a third over the past year, slumping to 12-year lows.\n\nAJ Bell’s Hewson and Coatsworth said that the shares have been “dragged down by markets’ disappointment with how the economies of Hong Kong and China are failing to show markedly improved momentum after the conclusion of their lengthy lockdowns imposed because of Covid-19.”\n\nThey explained that Prudential is now a play on demand for financial services in Asia and Africa, following the spin-off of fund manager M&G (MNG.L) in 2019, a fundraising in Hong Kong in 2021 and its 2022 demerger from Jackson Financial (JXN).\n\n“Prudential’s long-term strategy is to position itself for both population growth as well as increased prosperity and the rise of the middle class, as this is potentially the sweet spot for increased demand for financial products and services,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.\n\nHong Kong was Prudential’s most profitable market in 2022, followed by Singapore, Mainland China, Malaysia and Indonesia, with it highlighting India, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines as high-growth markets.\n\nRead more: 'We've grown £11m pizza delivery sales with no experience'\n\nPrudential’s CEO Anil Wadhwani, who took the reins earlier last year, set out two new financial objectives, one of which was to achieve a compound growth of 15% to 20% in new business profit between 2022 and 2027.\n\nNew business profit jumped 45% to $3.1bn in 2023, but Hewson and Coatsworth note that this was flat in the first quarter of 2024 on a constant currency basis, despite the firm pointing to a headline figure of 11% growth “excluding economic impacts” on a constant currency basis.\n\nAnother metric that they said would be in focus is Prudential’s operating profit, which on an adjusted basis came in at $2.9bn in 2023, up 8% on the previous year.\n\nPrudential paid out a dividend of 20.47 cents (16.5p) per share in 2023, with Hewson and Coatsworth saying that analysts expect a 6% increase in these distributions to the equivalent of 17.5p a share. The company announced a 2023 first interim dividend of 6.26 cents, or 5.16p, per share.\n\nHewson and Coatsworth said that another figure that investors will be looking at is Prudential’s annual premium equivalent, as a measure of new business written. This increased by 37% to $5.9bn in 2023 and grew by 7% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of this year, “thanks to a tough base for comparison in Hong Kong and China and a slowdown in Vietnam\".\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nCrowdStrike is set to report its second-quarter financial results on Wednesday, 28 August with the market keenly focused on the aftermath of the July IT outage that has significantly impacted the company’s valuation.\n\nThe cloud-based security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.4%, according to Zachs Research. Revenues are expected to be $958.66m, up 31% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe cybersecurity leader has seen its market value sharply decline after its involvement in a Microsoft-related IT disruption that caused widespread chaos. The incident, attributed to “a single content update for Windows hosts”, led to severe disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, emergency services and media outlets globally, according to CrowdStrike president George Kurtz.\n\nIn the wake of the outage, businesses affected have initiated legal action against both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Notably, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) has filed claims, citing losses ranging from $350m to $500m after being forced to cancel more than 6,000 flights.\n\nAs investors await CrowdStrike’s earnings call, they are particularly interested in how the ongoing legal challenges will impact the company’s financial health. However, Wedbush analysts have suggested that the financial damage may be less severe than initially anticipated.\n\nRead more: McDonald's targeted by grimace memecoin promoters\n\nAccording to legal experts cited by Wedbush, CrowdStrike’s potential liabilities from Delta’s lawsuit are likely to be in the \"single-digit\" millions, thanks to favourable user contracts that limit the company’s exposure to claims for revenue losses and liability.\n\nDespite these reassurances, there are concerns that the reputational damage from the outage could lead to a loss of future business, a risk that may weigh on CrowdStrike's long-term prospects.\n\nCiti (C) analysts said that CrowdStrike won't come out of the incident \"unscathed\" given higher discounts, lower negotiating leverage, and litigation costs it now faces.\n\nFoot Locker (FL) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nCiti has revised its outlook on Foot Locker, increasing the price target from $27 to $33, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This change comes in anticipation of Foot Locker’s second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday before the US bell.\n\nCiti's analysis say Foot Locker may outperform consensus expectations for both sales and earnings per share in the second quarter.\n\nIts optimism is driven by stronger-than-expected comparable store sales and gross margins, bolstered by the robust performance of several key brands in Foot Locker’s portfolio, including Adi Terrace, New Balance, Hoka, and On.\n\nDespite underperformance from Nike (NKE), Foot Locker’s largest brand, Citi believes the retailer will show a positive inflection in comparable sales for the second quarter, recovering from last year’s promotional pressures that negatively impacted gross margins.\n\nThe retailer is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.09 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 325%. However, revenues are projected to reach $1.88bn, marking a 0.9% increase compared to the same quarter last year, according to Zachs Research.\n\nFoot Locker’s management is expected to reaffirm its fiscal year 2024 guidance, though third-quarter projections may come in below consensus due to anticipated weaker gross margins.\n\nRecent analyst actions showcase a range of views on Foot Locker’s prospects. Following a disappointing first-quarter performance in 2024, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from Equalweight to Underweight, lowering the price target to $18 due to a more cautious outlook for 2024 (EPS, driven by expectations of a decline in both top-line growth and gross margins).\n\nArgus also maintained a Hold rating on Foot Locker, expressing caution about near-term earnings pressure as the company navigates a strategic transformation. Conversely, Jefferies, Barclays and Telsey Advisory Group have raised their price targets to $26, $27, and $27, respectively, recognising Foot Locker’s recent performance.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 26 August\n\nNo major companies reporting\n\nTuesday 27 August\n\nCNOOC (600938.SS)\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nVinci (DG.VI)\n\nWednesday 28 August\n\nHochschild Mining (HOC.L)\n\nCosco Shipping (CICOF)\n\nAir China (AIRYY)\n\nChina Construction Bank (601939.SS)\n\nWuliangye Yibin (000858.SZ)\n\nAgeas (AGS.BR)\n\nBrunello Cucinelli (8BU.F)\n\nNetApp (NTAP)\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI)\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF)\n\nCampbell Soup (CPB)\n\nKohl’s (KSS)\n\nJM Smucker (SJM)\n\nThursday 29 August\n\nSouth32 (S32.AX)\n\nQantas (QAN.AX)\n\nPernod Ricard (RI.PA)\n\nDelivery Hero (DHER.HM)\n\nFriday 30 August\n\nDell (DELL)\n\nMarvell (MRVL)\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-B)\n\nBest Buy (BBY)\n\nBirkenstock (BIRK)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "As markets eagerly anticipate Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s upcoming earnings report, Barclays analysts warn that it could serve as a \"reality check\" for the broader market, particularly in the tech sector.\n\nIn a client research note, the bank highlights the significance of Nvidia's earnings, set for release next week, in maintaining the momentum behind the AI and tech investment narrative that has dominated the market since late 2022.\n\nThe enthusiasm surrounding AI, which gained traction following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, was bolstered by Nvidia's \"blowout earnings\" in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAccording to Barclays, these results provided \"concrete evidence the AI theme could deliver hard revenue growth.\"\n\nSince then, Nvidia's earnings have consistently beat expectations, driving both the tech sector and the broader market. However, Barclays cautions that \"anything less than another beat and raise\" in Nvidia's upcoming report \"may prove to be a disappointment, with wider implications for the overall market.\"\n\nIn parallel, Barclays is closely monitoring Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole.\n\nThe speech is expected to \"fine-tune policy expectations\" as the market has already priced in a dovish stance from the Fed.\n\nThe bank notes that with four rate cuts being priced by OIS swaps before year end, the speech may not drastically alter the current market outlook, but it could influence short-term movements in rates and equities.\n\nBarclays notes that while \"the direction of travel is towards easier Fed policy,\" much of this dovish sentiment is already reflected in current market prices.\n\nAs such, the Jackson Hole event, coupled with Nvidia's earnings, could be pivotal in determining whether the market continues its current trajectory or faces a period of reassessment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings seen as more important than Powell's Jackson Hole speech: Barclays\n\nExclusive-WHO says partners can start talks to buy mpox vaccines before their approval\n\nWhat job RFK might get in a potential Trump Administration?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Big Tech dominance is forcing index superpowers to rethink rules",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Big Tech boom is causing headaches for all-powerful index providers on Wall Street, who can send billions of benchmark-tracking dollars on the move with just a stroke of the pen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago's Migrant Surge Is Stirring Trouble for Democrats in DNC Host City Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message With Self-Driving Vans, Hamburg Tries to Make Microtransit Work UK Transport Minister Clears Path for More 20mph Speed Zones\n\nTwo of the world’s biggest – FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices – are presenting plans to undercut the weighting of the largest megacap companies in key indexes. The rare intervention comes as the US equity market becomes increasingly lopsided thanks to the growing dominance of the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nPlayers of all stripes are being forced to adapt as the ownership of the largest tech shares in many portfolios starts to push against regulatory limits. And the pressure is building for the two index overlords, whose products are tracked by a combined $35 trillion.\n\nThe proposals offer fresh ammunition for critics of the passive-investing boom, who have long pointed out such strategies are more active than they appear. Any adjustments in an index reveal the hidden human hands behind the benchmarks.\n\n“Most investors may not realize that there is some degree of activeness even in what we consider passive strategies,” said Antti Petajisto, head of equities at Brooklyn Investment Group.\n\nRussell’s consultation, which is about capping the weighting of the largest members of its widely followed US growth and value gauges, is open until Aug. 30, with no time frame set for implementation.\n\nS&P’s consultation — focused on a new approach to restrain companies in a family of sector measures — ends Friday, with the changes scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23 if they are adopted.\n\nBehind the proposals are longstanding rules for regulated investment companies that limit any single security to 25% of a portfolio and the aggregate weight of the largest holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%. In the industry it’s often dubbed 25/5/50.\n\nEstablished to safeguard investors from over-exposure to too few names, the restrictions can be punishing in the modern market where companies such as Apple and Nvidia keep getting bigger.\n\nLast month, the top 10 constituents of the Russell 1000 Index — which are mainly tech stocks — comprised 34% of the gauge. While that’s not yet testing 25/5/50, it’s a level of concentration unseen in the benchmark’s 45-year history.\n\nStory continues\n\nRussell already offers a suite of capped indexes to supplement its more traditional, unconstrained measures. What’s being considered now is whether to apply weight caps to its standard style gauges, according to Catherine Yoshimoto, director of product management at FTSE Russell, an LSEG business. More than $7 trillion of assets are benchmarked to the firm’s style indexes.\n\n“Some clients are really pushing us to consider capping the standard Russell 1000 Growth Index, for example,” she said.\n\nA spokesperson for S&P declined to comment beyond the consultation paper and its index methodology.\n\nPassive funds have been grabbing market share from their active rivals in the past two decades, thanks to rock-bottom costs and the perceived shortcomings of discretionary stock pickers. Still, some market participants like to point out that this index revolution is less radical than it appears.\n\nIn this view, top-down decisions are made by humans in virtually every stage of a “passive” strategy, whether it’s writing the rules of an index, deciding how to apply them, designing the fund that tracks the benchmark, or actually executing its trades. For instance, contrary to what many assume, the S&P 500 Index — the main benchmark for the world’s largest stock market — does not simply contain America’s 500 biggest companies. Its members are selected by a group of anonymous index experts.\n\nThe proposed changes by S&P and Russell underscore the kinds of interventions that take place — and the differences between firms that can arise as a result.\n\nWhen it comes to adhering to the 25/5/50 limits, index managers use differing mechanisms to cap a company’s weight, as well as different triggers for when that process kicks in (although they all typically opt for a level slightly below 25/5/50 to provide a buffer.)\n\nFor example, in its proposal, Russell presents a capping threshold at 20/4.5/48. That’s different from the Nasdaq 100, whose methodology calls for 24/4.5/48, and S&P, whose cutoff is 24/4.8/50. The disparity likely reflects diverse approaches to determine the best way to reduce the probability of a breach occurring on a regular basis, according to Yoshimoto at Russell.\n\nMeanwhile to cap company weights, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim top holdings proportionally. But when a number of stocks breach the limit in S&P’s sector gauges, the smallest is trimmed first, suppressing its weight in the gauge — and leaving investors under-exposed.\n\nThat’s what happened in funds like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) in the first half of this year, when Nvidia was surging higher. The rules meant XLK under-owned the stock, so it trailed an uncapped tech benchmark by 10 percentage points in the period — the worst underperformance on record.\n\nThen, when Nvidia eclipsed Apple in June, it sparked a rebalance in which XLK bought an estimated $11 billion shares of the chipmaker at the expense of the iPhone manufacturer. Now that their positions are flipped again, XLK is at risk of another round of big shuffling. Should the current rankings hold until the next quarterly rebalance due September, Nvidia’s weight in the fund may have to drop to 4.5% from 21% as Apple’s spikes to 22% from 4.8%, based on the existing methodology.\n\nS&P’s proposed revision is aimed at reducing such frequent high turnovers, according to Edward Yoon, an index specialist at Macquarie Capital. Rather than targeting the smallest of the group that violates the diversification rule, the index owner proffers curbing them all in proportion to their market values.\n\nTo Josh Kutin, head of asset allocation, North America at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, whatever emerges from the consultations is surely no bad thing as it will help investors tackle the challenge of the increasingly concentrated market.\n\n“Asset allocators are obsessed with getting diversification so the more concentrated our portfolios are in any sense, the more uncomfortable we get,” he said. “I’m in favor of changes to reduce the reliance on market cap in index construction, even if that’s a human decision rather than a market mechanism.”\n\n--With assistance from Yiqin Shen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck FOMO Frenzy Fuels Taiwan Home Prices Despite Threat of China Invasion Five Questions With Deval Patrick at the DNC ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Just Invested in a New AI Stock. Is It a Buy?",
        "content": "There's no question about it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the most closely watched stock of the AI boom.\n\nIt's easy to see why. Nvidia has added more than $2 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, entering an exclusive echelon of the world's most valuable companies shared only with Apple and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, in addition to the company's own success in leading the AI chip revolution, it also carries a small investment portfolio, and a company as influential as Nvidia has the potential to move the needle with its stock purchases. Its biggest holding is Arm Holdings, the CPU architecture specialist that Nvidia works closely with. When it purchased shares of Soundhound AI in the first quarter, shares of that stock surged on the news.\n\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia bought just one stock, Serve Robotics (NASDAQ: SERV), a maker of food delivery robots that operate in public spaces. The stock jumped 9.6% on high-volume trading when news broke that Nvidia purchased 3.7 million shares in the second quarter, worth roughly $4.3 million today, or 10% of the company's market value. Image source: Serve Robotics.\n\nWhat is Serve Robotics?\n\nServe Robotics is a small AI and robotics company founded in 2021 that finished 2023 with just 67 employees. CEO Ali Kashani was previously a vice president at Postmates, an on-demand food delivery platform acquired by Uber (NYSE: UBER). Prior to that, he was the co-founder and chief technology officer at a smart home technology acquired by Generac, a maker of generators.\n\nYou may have seen Serve Robotics' autonomous delivery vehicles on the street. Uber Eats partnered with the company to test out delivery by robot in Los Angeles, and Serve also counts companies such as Yum! Brands' Pizza Hut, Shake Shack, and 7-Eleven as customers. In addition to being a major customer, Uber is also an investor in the company.\n\nServe Robotics is essentially just a development-stage company at this point. It reported $468,375 in revenue in the second quarter, but that was up 655% from the quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company had 48 \"daily active robots\" in the second quarter, meaning that was the average number of robots performing daily deliveries, more than doubling from 23 in the quarter the year before.\n\nServe also reported a $9.1 million operating loss in the quarter, as it's spending most of its money on research and development. The company finished the quarter with $28.8 million in cash and $4.3 million in total liabilities after raising $40 million in its second-quarter IPO.\n\nIt's aiming to deploy at least 250 more robots in Los Angeles by the end of the first quarter of next year. It also expects to have 2,000 robots active with Uber Eats by the end of 2025, which it said would generate $60 million to $80 million in annual revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Serve Robotics stock a buy?\n\nAt this point, Serve Robotics is a high-risk/high-reward type of stock. With less than $1 million in quarterly revenue, the company can't really be judged by its financials, but robotics, including delivery robots, is an emerging industry. The addressable market seems large as there's a clear financial incentive for a company like Uber to make robotic food delivery work as it would eliminate the existing labor costs.\n\nHaving both Uber and Nvidia, the leading ride-sharing platform and chipmaker, as investors is also a credit to the company, and those relationships should give the company a competitive advantage over other robotics. Potentially, it will give Serve preferred access to Nvidia chips and technology and make room for more collaborations with Uber.\n\nWith those relationships and a leading position in an emerging technology, Serve Robotics has a lot of upside potential. Taking a small position in the stock right now would make sense for risk-tolerant investors looking to round out their AI stock holdings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Serve Robotics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Serve Robotics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Serve Robotics wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stocks Down 51% and 43% That I Just Made Huge Investments In",
        "content": "Although the early August market pullback may have been short-lived, it created opportunities to purchase excellent companies at much lower valuations. The Nasdaq Composite entered correction territory (defined as 10% off its recent high) and pulled back nearly 14%, while the S&P 500 flirted with a correction. However, both indexes recouped the majority of their losses in more recent trading sessions. QQQ data by YCharts.\n\nWhile some see sharp market pullbacks and run for the exits, savvy investors see them as fantastic opportunities. Corrections are normal and necessary events in the market. They generally occur about once a year on average and are actually healthy. Without periodic corrections, bull markets can become overheated and lead to bubbles, which are often followed by deeper crashes that can seriously harm not just the economy, but seriously dent long-term investors' wealth building process.\n\nAnd so, the best action for long-term investors amid corrections is to keep emotions at bay, and stay calm and take advantage of the volatility by purchasing shares of compelling companies at a discount.\n\nI did this with Dell(NYSE: DELL) and Micron(NASDAQ: MU), two companies that are benefiting from the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers.\n\nData centers are critical to AI\n\nThe shift to cloud computing over the last couple of decades necessitated the construction of a host of massive data centers (buildings filled with infrastructure, servers, network, and storage equipment, etc.) to process and store data. Without them, software for businesses, online banking, streaming television, gaming, and many other applications wouldn't function. The boom driven by AI programs creates another technical challenge.\n\nGenerative AI software requires much more processing power than other applications, so more capacity is needed now. Some data centers are small, less than 10,000 square feet, while others are massive, at more than 1 million square feet. So-called hyperscalers like Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet build these massive centers. Here are a few fun facts:\n\nThe U.S. is home to more than half of the world's approximately 10,000 data centers. 120 new hyperscale data centers could become operational each year for the next 10 years. Elon Musk's xAI plans to build a gigantic data center in Tennessee that could include 100,000 Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) liquid-cooled GPUs.\n\nDell and Micron will benefit significantly from rising data center demand. Both have industry expertise, critical products, and long-standing partnerships with AI chip leader Nvidia. But the recent correction sent their stocks tumbling, at one point down 51% and 43%, respectively, before recovering slightly, as depicted below.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite their strength over the past year and a half or so, the stocks are still down significantly from their recent highs. Here's why I picked up significant positions in both.\n\nIs Dell an overlooked AI stock?\n\nDell divides its business into two segments: the client solutions group (CSG) and the infrastructure solutions group (ISG). The client side includes PCs, laptops, and gaming products. CSG revenue was relatively flat in its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended May 3, 2024) due to a weak consumer market. However, my focus is on the infrastructure solutions segment. This segment supplies data center infrastructure, including AI-ready servers, data storage, and liquid cooling technology.\n\nThe ISG segment posted 22% growth in fiscal Q1 to reach $9.2 billion in revenue, while servers and networking sales grew 42% year over year to $5.5 billion, illustrating the increasing demand from data centers. The company also reported $1.7 billion in AI-optimized servers shipped in fiscal Q1, double the amount shipped in the prior quarter.\n\nDell stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22, higher than its 3-year average. However, its forward P/E is just 14 based on analysts' forecasts. Given the current demand, Dell has a great chance to beat these estimates.\n\nManagement believes the AI runway is long, and announced a refocused effort tailored to AI in the last earnings call. The recent pullback in its stock price should be compelling for long-term investors.\n\nIs Micron stock a buy now?\n\nData centers and AI programs require boatloads of memory in addition to the infrastructure discussed above. Micron is one of the leading memory providers in the world. It operates in three main end markets: data center, PC, and mobile and intelligent edge (which includes automotive and industrial). While sales into the PC and mobile markets are expected to rise slightly, the excitement is around the data center business.\n\nMicron produces a product called high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). In the latest earnings report, Micron points out that:\n\nHBM sales hit $100 million in the quarter. Management expects several hundred million dollars of HBM sales this fiscal year and \"several billion\" next fiscal year; It has already sold out of HBM through the end of 2025; Its customer base is expanding.\n\nTotal revenue in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended May 30) was $6.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 82%. AI-related sales grew 50% over the prior quarter. Strong demand allowed Micron to significantly expand its margins, operating profits, and cash flow.\n\nMicron stock is difficult to value using a simple P/E ratio because the company has substantial non-cash expenses, primarily depreciation and amortization, that skew its net income. However, analysts have more sophisticated methods of valuing companies. Currently, an overwhelming majority of analysts following the stock have given it buy or strong buy recommendations, and their average price target on it is $157. Micron stock would need to gain 45% to reach that level.\n\nDell and Micron will benefit from the AI/data center up cycle, which could last years. Long-term investors should consider them after the recent pullback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Blackwell concerns 'overdone', buy Nvidia stock into earnings: Evercore",
        "content": "Evercore ISI analysts advised investors to buy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker’s earnings report for the July quarter, stressing that recent concerns over Blackwell delays are “overdone.”\n\nThe investment bank notes that demand for Nvidia systems remains strong, citing a 20% quarter-on-quarter surge in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) in Q2 2024. Looking ahead, CapEx is expected to grow a further 8% and 10% in Q3 and Q4, respectively.\n\nEarlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia’s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which includes its next-generation AI chips, could face a delay of up to three months. The news raised investors' concerns about the sustainability of NVIDIA's stock's upward trajectory and was a contributing factor to the recent sell-off.\n\nAfter analyzing three previous instances of Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, Evercore analysts conclude that while a negative announcement could lead to a short-term 5%-to-10% drop in the stock, NVDA has consistently demonstrated its ability to swiftly develop alternative solutions.\n\n“Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,” analysts noted.\n\nMoreover, they observe that Nvidia shares have experienced two significant corrections, each over 50%, in recent history: one in the second half of 2018, occurring one quarter before peak capital expenditure (CapEx) when the stock was trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38, and another in 2021-22, four quarters before peak CapEx, starting with a P/E of 67.\n\nWith peak CapEx forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2025 and NVIDIA's current P/E at 39, the analysts do not anticipate a significant sell-off in the stock before mid-2025.\n\nOverall, Evercore’s team continues to view NVDA as its “Top Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,” positioned to capture up to 80% of the value created in the parallel processing era.\n\nAnalysts believe the AI darling could accumulate more than $10 of earnings per share (EPS) power by 2030 “and that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.”\n\nNear-term, Evercore raises its third-quarter and 2024 estimates for Nvidia and lift its target price on the stock from $145 to $150.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBlackwell concerns 'overdone', buy Nvidia stock into earnings: Evercore\n\nVolkswagen's battery targets not 'set in stone', battery chief tells FAS\n\nSociete Generale drops ring-dealing membership of LME\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 1 Stock-Split AI Stock to Buy Before It Soars 100% in the Next Year (Hint: Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Two artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have led the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) higher this year. Semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and server manufacturer Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have see their share prices surge 159% and 119%, respectively.\n\nBoth companies recently announced 10-for-1 stock splits to make shares more affordable. Nvidia completed its split in June, and Super Micro Computer will follow suit in late September. But Wall Street analysts expect both stocks to move even higher over the next 12 months.\n\nNvidia's median target of $140 per share implies 10% upside from its current share price of $127. And Super Micro's median target of $693 per share implies 16% upside from its current share price of $600. But I think Super Micro stock will soar 100% in the next year, achieving a split-adjusted share price of $120 by August 2025.\n\nThat said, patient investors should consider buying both stocks.\n\nNvidia: Delayed Blackwell shipments create uncertainty ahead of earnings\n\nNvidia reported stellar financial results in the first quarter, crushing estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 262% to $26 billion and non-GAAP net income climbed 461% to $6.12 per diluted share. CEO Jensen Huang said, \"Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform.\"\n\nHowever, shipments of Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs will be delayed three months due to a design flaw \"discovered unusually late in the production process,\" according to The Information. Blackwell chips can run training and inference workloads more quickly than the previous Hopper generation, which should further cement Nvidia's leadership position in AI chips.\n\nFollowing the report, Nvidia shares slipped to their lowest level since May, but the stock has since rebounded, suggesting the market sees little reason to worry. Indeed, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore doubts the delayed launch of Blackwell will have a material impact on the Nvidia's near-term outlook or its ability to achieve Wall Street estimates.\n\nHowever, investors should proceed cautiously. Management has yet to address the issue, so it represents an unknown that demands explanation when the company reports earnings on Aug. 28. Expectations are already high given that Nvidia has crushed Wall Street estimates in recent quarters, so bad news could cause the stock to decline sharply.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to grow at 37% annually over the next three year. That makes the current valuation of 75 times earnings look a little pricey, though not absurdly expensive. Patient investors can buy a very small position today, provided they are comfortable with the possibility of a post-earnings decline. In that scenario, investors should consider buying a slightly larger position on the pullback.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer: The market leader in AI servers is expected to gain share\n\nSuper Micro Computer designs servers and storage solutions for cloud and private data centers. Internal manufacturing capabilities and a unique building-block approach to product development allow the company to rapidly build servers with the latest chips from suppliers like Nvidia. As a result, Super Micro typically beats competitors to market by two to six months, according to CEO Charlies Liang.\n\nThat advantage has made Super Micro the leader in artificial intelligence (AI) servers, and analysts expect the company to gain share quickly. Bank of America analysts expect Super Micro to account for 17% of AI server sales by 2026, up from 10% last year. Tom Blakely at KeyBanc is more bullish. He thinks Super Micro's market share could top 20% this year. He also says the company has \"competitive moats that should sustain if not expand this share in coming years.\"\n\nSupermicro reported mixed financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended June 30). Revenue surged 143% to $5.3 billion on record demand for AI infrastructure. However, gross margin contracted 5.8 percentage points to 11.2% and non-GAAP net income climbed just 78% to $6.25 per diluted share. Wall Street expected non-GAAP earnings to increase 130% to $8.14 per diluted share.\n\nThe stock plunged following the report, reflecting concerns that margins contracted because Super Micro lacks pricing power in an increasingly competitive market. But CEO Charles Liang attributed the margin crunch to costs associated with direct liquid cooling (DLC) components. Moreover, he expects gross margin to normalize between 14% and 17% by the end of fiscal 2025 (ends June 2025) as DLC servers begin shipping in higher volume.\n\nImportantly, investments in DLC technology could reinforce Super Micro's position as the market leader in AI servers. Liquid cooling is more cost effective than traditional air cooling, so demand for DLC servers is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as data centers are filled with powerful AI hardware generating tremendous amounts of heat. Super Micro has positioned itself as an early leader in DLC technology.\n\nLooking ahead, Super Micro's guidance for fiscal 2025 implies revenue growth between 74% and 101%. If the company hits the high end of that range, its share price could increase 100% without any change in the price-to-sales ratio.

        "title": "NVDA vs. AMD: Which Semiconductor Stock Is Better?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two semiconductor stocks: Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). A closer look suggests a long-term bullish view of Nvidia and a neutral view of AMD.\n\nWhile both companies make semiconductors, Nvidia focuses on artificial intelligence, gaming, cryptocurrency, electric vehicles, robotics, and other uses. AMD is also trying to get into the AI game but also targets servers, gaming, the embedded-chip market, healthcare, laptops, and desktop computers.\n\nShares of Nvidia have soared 149% year-to-date and 162% over the past year. Meanwhile, AMD stock is up 3% year-to-date and 38% over the last year.\n\nWith Nvidia up so much year-to-date and AMD climbing so little, it may be a bit surprising that NVDA’s valuation is a fraction of AMD’s. We compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry.\n\nFor comparison, the semiconductor industry is trading at a P/E of 63.3x, versus the three-year average of 36.3x.\n\nNvidia\n\nAt a P/E of 75.2x, Nvidia is trading at a premium to its industry, but it’s well deserved due to the massive growth the company has been putting up. The forward P/E of 42.5x looks even more attractive, calling for a long-term bullish view on Nvidia.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Nvidia is way ahead of AMD in AI, and its current multiples and long-term share-price growth just make it too cheap to ignore. The company’s stock has been trading towards the middle to low end of its normalized P/E range of 37x to 107x since November 2019, which excludes the spike between March and September 2023.\n\nNvidia’s five-year stock return of 3,080% and a 10-year return of nearly 26,800% also make this stock one to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nOne word of caution for investors: Nvidia’s Q2 earnings report is coming up next week, and if it disappoints, it could kick off some volatility in the shares. However, it would present a nice buy-the-dip opportunity to add to a position or establish a new one.\n\nIn the last quarter, Nvidia reported explosive year-over-year growth of over 260% in revenue and 628% in net income, so the bar is set quite high. However, if the stock skyrockets after the Q2 earnings report, investors may miss the boat on this stock — until the next dip, anyway.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNvidia has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $144.17, the average NVDA stock price target implies upside potential of 16.51%.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAt a P/E of 189.9x, Advanced Micro Devices is trading at a sizable premium to its industry and Nvidia, even though it has fallen behind in AI. While the company is catching up, growing concerns suggest it might be too little, too late. AMD’s forward P/E of 35.9x is attractive, but there’s no guarantee the company will put up the results required to achieve that. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate until we see some actual results on this front.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, AMD reported a mere 9% year-over-year growth rate in revenue for its latest quarter, which is minuscule compared to Nvidia’s growth. Net income exploded by 881% but remained tiny at $265 million, despite the multi-billion-dollar sales.\n\nAlthough AMD reported record growth in its Data Center segment and accelerating AI sales, these gains have yet to positively impact the bottom line. The company launched new AI chips in June, making next quarter’s results crucial. However, I’d like to see more concrete outcomes before taking a more positive stance on this stock.\n\nA key concern is the growing discussion about the potential for AI investments to take years before generating a return on invested capital. If this narrative continues to pick up, AMD may end up being too late to the party. For instance, Goldman Sachs recently reported that tech giants are expected to spend over $1 trillion on AI capital expenditures in the coming years.\n\nWhile that could benefit AMD in the near term if it turns out to be true, experts like Daron Acemoglu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs are skeptical about whether all those invested dollars will pay off.\n\nAdditionally, AMD’s focus on data centers could be problematic, as highlighted by a recent Ernst & Young (EY) AI Pulse survey. The survey showed that while executives are pouring money into AI, they’re not investing in the necessary infrastructure to support it—precisely what AMD is currently offering.\n\nAlthough some Goldman Sachs analysts are more optimistic about the potential returns from AI investments, there could still be concerns for AMD stock if it arrives too late to capitalize on the trend. However, there is likely room for two major AI players in the semiconductor industry, so AMD isn’t necessarily doomed in the long run. The stock just appears to be overpriced at its current valuation.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, six Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $191.45, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 26.20%.\n\nSee more AMD analyst ratings\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Neutral on AMD\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have been facing off in the semiconductor space for many years, with one surging ahead of the other at different times. This time, it’s Nvidia’s time to shine, but its valuation isn’t necessarily full at current levels. On the other hand, I would take a wait-and-see approach with AMD to see how its AI chips perform compared to Nvidia’s.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: Wall Street's Next Stock Split Announcement Will Come From a Company That's Gained 150,000% Since Its IPO",
        "content": "Despite historically hot trends like artificial intelligence (AI) dominating headlines on Wall Street, it's stock-split euphoria that's played an equally impressive role in sending the broader market higher in 2024.\n\nPut simply, a stock split is a tool publicly traded companies can lean on to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. The beauty of stock splits is they're entirely cosmetic and have no effect on a company's market cap or underlying operating performance.\n\nThere are two types of stock splits -- forward and reverse -- with the former being far more popular than the latter among the investing community. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nReverse splits are enacted to increase a company's share price, often with the goal of maintaining continued listing standards for a major stock exchange. Since most reverse-stock splits are conducted from a position of operating weakness, investors tend to keep their distance from this variety of split.\n\nMeanwhile, forward-stock splits are designed to reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for retail investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases through their broker. Companies with high-flying stocks that require a forward split to make their shares more \"nominally affordable\" are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2024, 13 phenomenal businesses have announced or completed stock splits -- none of which have been more anticipated than that of AI juggernaut Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Given that companies conducting forward splits have, since 1980, more than doubled the return of the benchmark S&P 500 in the 12 months following their split announcement, investors are eager to guess which top-tier stock will be next to unveil a forward-stock split.\n\nNvidia had all the hallmarks of a Wall Street stock-split stock\n\nPrior to Nvidia announcing its largest-ever forward split (10-for-1) on May 22, there were more than enough clues to suggest that a stock split was imminent.\n\nThe obvious clue with Nvidia was that its stock had increased by 550% between the start of 2023 and the day it released its fiscal first-quarter operating results, where it revealed its historic split. No one on Wall Street has ever witnessed a market-leading company add around $2.8 trillion in market cap in what feels like the blink of an eye.\n\nTo build on this point, Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns have made it particularly popular with everyday investors. It's become the fourth most-held security (including exchange-traded funds) on retail investor-dominated online trading platform Robinhood. Not requiring retail investors to save $1,300 to purchase a single share of Nvidia might help sustain the euphoria behind its near-parabolic climb.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's market-leading status among graphics processing unit (GPU) developers for AI-accelerated data centers also made it a logical candidate to conduct a stock split. Semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights estimates that of the 2.67 million data-center GPU shipments in 2022 and 3.85 million GPU shipments in 2023, Nvidia accounted for all but 30,000 GPUs shipped in 2022 and 90,000 GPUs shipped in 2023. It's grabbed a stranglehold of the GPU market share that's powering generative AI solutions and training large language models (LLMs) in enterprise data centers.\n\nThe company's CUDA computing platform provides yet another reason Nvidia splitting its stock made sense. CUDA is the toolkit that helps developers build LLMs and speed up computing applications. The key point is that Nvidia's software is working in tandem with its top-tier hardware to keep businesses loyal to its myriads of products and services.\n\nWith Nvidia laying the blueprint for what to look for in future stock-split stocks, there's one logical candidate that stands out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPrediction: This 150,000% gainer will be the next high-profile stock split announcement on Wall Street\n\nIn terms of brand-name, time-tested, dominant companies, I'd expect Wall Street's next high-level stock split announcement to come from warehouse club Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST).\n\nAlthough no stock goes up every year, Costco has come very close to breaking the mold. Including dividends paid, Costco has delivered a positive total return to its shareholders in 20 of the last 23 years. More impressively, its shares have increased in value by 150,000%, including dividends, since its initial public offering (IPO) in December 1985.\n\nIt's been close to a quarter of a century since Costco last conducted a stock split, with its three prior splits occurring in January 2000 (2-for-1), March 1992 (3-for-2), and May 1991 (2-for-1). With shares of the company approaching $900, it's fair to assume that some everyday investors without access to fractional-share purchases are being forced to stay on the sidelines.\n\nOne of Costco's biggest and clearest competitive advantages is its size. The company's deep pockets allow it to purchase goods in bulk, which lowers the per-unit cost of each item. With price being such an important concern for shoppers, buying in bulk has consistently helped Costco undercut traditional grocery chains and mom-and-pop shops on cost.\n\nIt's important to note that Costco's warehouses sell a mix of discretionary goods and consumer staples. Regardless of how well the U.S. economy is performing or what the prevailing rate of inflation is, consumers still need to purchase groceries and basic household necessities. In other words, Costco is drawing in consumers in all economic climates, which typically leads to highly predictable sales and operating cash flow.\n\nAnother identifiable edge Costco brings to the table is its membership-driven operating model. Annual membership fees generate high margins and can be used to offset the low prices and razor-thin margins for groceries that help the company court new members. Plus, paying an annual fee to shop at Costco is liable to encourage consumers to get as much out of their membership as possible. In short, they're going to choose Costco over other shopping destinations when making large purchases.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle for Costco is its exceptional pricing power. Beginning on Sept. 1, the annual fees for its Gold Star and Business memberships will increase $5 to $65, while Executive memberships will jump $10 to $130 per year. The first increase in membership fees since 2017 isn't going to scare away this warehouse club's fiercely loyal customers.\n\nSo when Costco lifts the hood on its fiscal fourth-quarter operating results on Sept. 26, don't be surprised if it also unveils its first stock split since January 2000.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "10 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "One of the biggest investing developments of the past couple of years has been the opportunity represented by artificial intelligence (AI), and arguably no company is better positioned to profit from this secular tailwind than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker has become the poster child for the AI revolution, giving it the pole position in a large and growing opportunity.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade, according to McKinsey & Company, and Nvidia is at the leading edge of the trend. That massive opportunity is one of many reasons that investors should be buying Nvidia stock like there's no tomorrow. Let's look at a few others. Nvidia's Blackwell AI chip. Image source: Nvidia.\n\n1. Nvidia dominates the data center market\n\nThere's little argument that Nvidia has the inside track when it comes to graphics processing units (GPUs) in data centers, but some investors may not realize the extent of the company's dominance.\n\nNvidia controls an estimated 92% of the market for data center GPUs, according to IoT Analytics, though that estimate may be conservative. TechInsights goes further, claiming Nvidia controlled 98% of the data center GPU market in 2023. While estimates vary, the indication is clear.\n\nThe competition is intent on chipping away at its dominance. However, given Nvidia's early lead and sustained momentum, it should remain the clear leader for years to come.\n\n2. It's the undisputed leader powering earlier versions of AI\n\nWhile generative AI has made a splash since early last year, AI has been around for decades, and Nvidia has been helping to power those advanced algorithms. For example, Nvidia controls 95% of the market for GPUs used in machine learning -- an earlier version of AI -- according to estimates provided by New Street Research. This experience would soon come in handy.\n\n3. The inside track for generative AI\n\nNvidia's wealth of expertise in the field and dominance in earlier versions of AI made it the clear choice for developers when generative AI exploded onto the scene. Developments in the space are moving at warp speed, so it is even more difficult to pin down Nvidia's market share. Analysts from Mizuho suggest it's somewhere between 70% and 95% for AI models. That aligns with an estimate by Fortune, which puts Nvidia's market share at 80%.\n\n4. The platform factor\n\nNvidia's dominance in the AI and data center markets was years in the making, but it isn't just the result of the company's chip process. In 2007, Nvidia launched Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), an architectural framework and parallel computing platform that helps developers by dramatically accelerating computing applications built on its GPUs.\n\nAccording to Nvidia, CUDA provides developers with more than 300 libraries and 600 AI models, and supports more than 3,700 GPU-accelerated applications. This ecosystem includes more than 5 million developers at 40,000 companies, which helps explain why it will be so difficult to \"chip\" away at Nvidia's dominance, given that it's developers' preferred development platform of choice.\n\n5. It isn't just about chips anymore\n\nWhile its processors form the foundation of Nvidia's empire, it isn't just about chips anymore. The company has been gradually expanding into adjacent markets and also provides ancillary products that help its GPUs perform even better. These other opportunities could help fuel the next leg of Nvidia's growth.\n\nFor example, Nvidia supplies InfiniBand networking solutions, including switches and adapters that reduce latency and help speed network connections. Then there's the NVLink and NVLink Switch, used to connect multiple GPUs in a daisy chain, accelerating the resulting connections to unleash their full power. The company also offers its own line of turnkey AI servers and supercomputers.\n\n6. Robust research and development (R&D) spending\n\nIt's no accident that Nvidia has maintained its position atop the AI chip heap. The company has a long track record of spending heavily on the research and development (R&D) necessary to maintain its technological lead. For its fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia spent nearly $8.7 billion on R&D, up 18% and amounting to 14% of the company's total revenue.\n\nBesides maintaining its technological edge, increased spending has also helped the company innovate faster. Earlier this year, Nvidia announced that it would no longer keep to its historical two-year cadence for unveiling new processors, but rather release new chips every year.\n\nIt was already difficult for rivals to keep up with Nvidia's frantic development pace, but it will be even harder now.\n\n7. Let's not forget gaming\n\nAt this point, it almost seems like a footnote, but Nvidia began its journey as a pioneer in video games. It was parallel processing, or the ability to conduct a magnitude of complex calculations simultaneously, that revolutionized the gaming industry, turning boxy figures into lifelike images.\n\nNvidia is still the undisputed leader, with an 88% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, according to industry analyst Jon Peddie Research. This leaves scraps for the competition. Don't expect that to change anytime soon.\n\n8. An explosion of profitability\n\nThe advent of generative AI early last year and the resulting rapid adoption has been a boon to Nvidia. For fiscal 2024, revenue of $60 billion surged 126% year over year. This brought with it a flood of increasing profitability, as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93 soared 586%.\n\nThat trend continued into the current year. In its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), revenue of $26 billion grew 262% year over year, while EPS of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nManagement is forecasting that its growth streak will continue. The company is guiding for second-quarter revenue of $28 billion when Nvidia reports on Aug. 28. Analysts' consensus estimates are even higher, expecting revenue of $28.6 billion. In either case, that's phenomenal sales growth, and profits will likely follow suit.\n\n9. Returns to shareholders are increasing\n\nNvidia's recent run has been a windfall for shareholders, as the stock has skyrocketed more than 500% over the past three years, as of this writing. Yet there have been other benefits for investors.\n\nIn conjunction with the company's quarterly report and 10-for-1 stock split revelation in May, Nvidia announced that it was increasing its dividend by 150% from $0.04 to $0.10. The dividend hasn't been a priority for the company until now, as growth has taken center stage. However, given its newfound wealth, I wouldn't be surprised if there were additional increases on the horizon.\n\n10. It isn't as expensive as you might think\n\nNvidia's skyrocketing stock price has brought with it a commensurate increase in its valuation, causing some investors to keep their distance. That's understandable, given the stock is currently selling for 74 times earnings and 39 times sales, but that only tells part of the story. While the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are among the most widely used valuation metrics, they also have their limitations. They tend to label most high-growth stocks as expensive or overvalued by default.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which takes into account its impressive growth trajectory, clocks in at 0.7, when any number lower than 1 indicates an undervalued stock. So the stock isn't as expensive as it appears at first glance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Cheapest Trillion-Dollar Stock: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta?",
        "content": "Six U.S. companies are valued at $1 trillion or more, and they all operate in the technology sector:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.44 trillion Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): $3.16 trillion Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): $3.14 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $2.07 trillion Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.87 trillion Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): $1.33 trillion\n\nAll of these companies are profitable, so they can be valued with the widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It's calculated by dividing the share price of a given company by its earnings per share. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.9, which is a good reference point: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia is the most expensive trillion-dollar stock today on a P/E basis. However, the company is growing so quickly it has a forward P/E ratio of just 33.1 based on next year's earnings forecast. In other words, its valuation is much more reasonable if investors are willing to hold it for a couple of years.\n\nThe cheapest stock of the group is Alphabet. A judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, and the U.S. Department of Justice wants to break up the company to resolve that issue. It could take years -- if it happens at all -- but combined with growing competition from artificial intelligence chatbots, which are threatening the dominance of Google Search, investors are treading cautiously with respect to Alphabet's valuation.\n\nFinally, Amazon deserves a mention. It's on track to generate $635 billion in revenue this year, which is more than any of its peers, and it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue).

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Friday as markets gauged hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan and mixed Japanese inflation data, with focus turning squarely to an upcoming address by the Federal Reserve Chairman.\n\nRegional markets took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, as a rebound in Treasury yields and a sharp selldown in technology shares sparked steep overnight losses.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose in Asian trade, with all eyes on an address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium later on Friday.\n\nPowell’s address comes amid growing conviction that the Fed will cut interest rates in September. But signs of a rapidly cooling labor market also fueled concerns over a slowdown in the U.S. economy, which cooled risk appetite this week.\n\nJapanese stocks drift lower amid hawkish BOJ talk, mixed CPI\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes fell about 0.2% each, with both indexes set for a middling end to the week as a rebound from early-August losses stalled.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said in a parliamentary hearing that he still saw interest rates as very low, and that they needed to increase further to reach a neutral level. Ueda also reiterated plans to raise interest rates further if inflation remained steady- his comments coming after the BOJ hiked rates in an end-July meeting.\n\nBut Ueda’s comments were somewhat undermined by mixed consumer price index inflation data for July. The reading showed that core and headline CPI inflation rose on improved consumer spending and higher wages.\n\nBut underlying inflation- which excludes food and energy costs and is a key inflation metric for the BOJ- fell below the bank’s 2% annual target.\n\nThe reading raised some doubts over just how much headroom the BOJ has to keep raising rates.\n\nJapanese markets were rattled by a hawkish BOJ earlier in August, although they did recoup a bulk of their last week.\n\nAsian stocks weak, tech tracks Wall St losses\n\nBroader Asian markets mostly edged lower, and were set for a middling weekly performance as a rebound from early Augusts’ losses stalled.\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes saw relatively bigger losses, tracking losses in their U.S. peers as anticipation of earnings from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), due next week, also sparked caution.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.5%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 0.9% on losses in major Chinese internet stocks.\n\nChinese stocks remained close to six-month lows, with the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes moving in a flat-to-low range on Friday. The two were also headed for a 1% decline this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 fell 0.3%, while futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open although the index is expected to face resistance at the 25,000 level.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks drift lower amid mixed Japan cues; Powell speech looms\n\nExclusive-Chinese entities turn to Amazon cloud and its rivals to access high-end US chips, AI\n\nFactbox-List of Chinese entities who have turned to the cloud for access to restricted US tech\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.\n\nProviding access to such technologies through the cloud is not a violation of U.S. regulations.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: \"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China.\"\n\nFollowing is a list of Chinese entities that sought access to restricted U.S. technologies through the cloud, according to the documents that were reviewed by Reuters.\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing AI models and computing power via AWS:\n\n1. Zhejiang Lab\n\nThe state-run research institute is developing its own large-language model, GeoGPT, and said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan ($25,760) to purchase AWS cloud computing services, as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba. The institute told Reuters that it did not go through with the purchase but did not say why. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not determine if the purchase had been completed.\n\n2. National Center of Technology Innovation for EDA\n\nThe state-backed entity, which helps Chinese companies develop chip design blueprints for mass production, said in an April tender document it spent 600,000 yuan to buy an overseas AWS account for the purpose of accessing Claude 3, an AI model developed by Anthropic. Anthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude. The center did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEntities accessing advanced U.S. chips via AWS:\n\n1. Shenzhen University\n\nShenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. Exports to China of the two Nvidia chips are banned by the U.S.\n\nShenzhen University got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed. The university and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.\n\n2. Fujian Chuanzheng Communications College\n\nThe vocational college backed by the Fujian provincial government spent 85,000 yuan in August last year on an AWS account that would give it access to clusters made up of over 4,000 Nvidia A100 chips. The supplier was Xiamen Hanwei Software Technology Ltd Co, according to the August tender document.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe college said in the tender document that the purchase was designed to \"keep pace with the latest developments in cloud computing technology...and enhance the quality of cloud computing talent training and professional development at educational institutions.\"\n\nThe college and Xiamen Hanwei did not respond to requests for comment. An AWS spokesperson said \"the vast majority of this small tender pertained to skills training, and the very small portion that related to cloud services did not use any of the restricted AI chips.\"\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing OpenAI tools via Microsoft's Azure\n\n1. Chongqing Changan Automobile Co\n\nThe state-owned car maker said in May last year it was looking for a retailer authorised by Microsoft that could set up Azure OpenAI accounts and integrate generative AI technology into the company's systems and applications. The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether it went through with the purchase. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment and Reuters could not determine whether the purchase went through.\n\n2. Sichuan University\n\nIn April, Sichuan University said it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Azure OpenAI tokens in order to support the delivery of this project. The supplier was Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd, a May tender document showed. The Chinese entities and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOpenAI said in a statement its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft’s policies. It did not comment on the tenders.\n\nEntities accessing or expressing interest in accessing U.S. chips via cloud services\n\n1. Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)\n\nThe USTC institute said in a March filing that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider and Reuters could not determine its identity.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department added USTC to its Entity List in May 2024 for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China’s military, and involvement in its nuclear program development.\n\nUSTC did not respond to a request for comment on the transaction and on being put on the entity list.\n\n2. Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)\n\nThe university's Department of Computer Science bought in April four months of usage time on a server powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips by paying 196,000 yuan to Shenzhen Yunbing Technology Co Ltd for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe university's Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering was added in February 2022 to the Unverified List, which means parties that engage in business with the department must take additional compliance steps to address U.S. concerns about potential national security risks.\n\nSUSTech and Shenzhen Yunbing did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n3. Tsinghua University\n\nOne of the most frequent state-affiliated buyers of banned Nvidia chips said in November 2023 that it planned to spend almost half a million yuan to rent 10 or more servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, to provide AI computing power for an unspecified purpose. The contract was awarded to Beijing Parallel Technology Co Ltd, a Reuters check showed. Neither entity responded to a request for comment.\n\n4. China Coal Research Institute\n\nA major R&D hub for China's coal industry, the institute said in June it wanted to purchase four servers powered by Nvidia A100 chips. The institute did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not establish if the purchase went ahead.\n\n5. China National Knowledge Infrastructure\n\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure, which operates the country's largest academic database, said it wanted to purchase a cloud computing account with a validity of three years that could give it access to Nvidia A100 computing power. The tender was awarded to Inner Mongolia Tongfang Exploration Technology Co Ltd, a Reuters check showed. Neither company responded to a request for comment.\n\n($1 = 7.1429 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld\n\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.\n\nThe U.S. government has restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China over the past two years, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities.\n\nProviding access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud, however, is not a violation of U.S. regulations since only exports or transfers of a commodity, software or technology are regulated.\n\nA Reuters review of more than 50 tender documents posted over the past year on publicly available Chinese databases showed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted U.S. technologies or cloud services.\n\nAmong those, four explicitly named Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud service provider, though they accessed the services through Chinese intermediary companies rather than from AWS directly.\n\nThe tender documents, which Reuters is the first to report on, show the breadth of strategies Chinese entities are employing to secure advanced computing power and access generative AI models. They also underscore how U.S. companies are capitalising on China's growing demand for computing power.\n\n\"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China,\" a spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business said.\n\nAWS controls nearly a third of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to research firm Canalys. In China, AWS is the sixth-largest cloud service provider, according to research firm IDC.\n\nShenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan ($27,996) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. It got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed.\n\nExports to China of the two Nvidia chips, which are used to power large-language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are banned by the U.S.\n\nShenzhen University and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.\n\nZhejiang Lab, a research institute developing its own LLM, GeoGPT, said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan to purchase AWS cloud computing services as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spokesperson for Zhejiang Lab said that it did not follow through with the purchase but did not respond to questions about the reasoning behind this decision or how it met its LLM's computing power requirements. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReuters could not establish whether or not the purchase went ahead.\n\nThe U.S. government is now trying to tighten regulations to restrict access through the cloud.\n\n\"This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it,\" Michael McCaul, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in a statement, referring to the remote access of advanced U.S. computing through the cloud by foreign entities.\n\nLegislation was introduced in Congress in April to empower the commerce department to regulate remote access of U.S. technology, but it is not clear if and when it will be passed.\n\nA department spokesperson said it was working closely with Congress and \"seeking additional resources to strengthen our existing controls that restrict PRC companies from accessing advanced AI chips through remote access to cloud computing capability.\"\n\nThe commerce department also proposed a rule in January that would require U.S. cloud computing services to verify large AI model users and report to regulators when they use U.S. cloud computing services to train large AI models capable of \"malicious cyber-enabled activity\".\n\nThe rule, which has not been finalized, would also enable the commerce secretary to impose prohibitions on customers.\n\n\"We are aware the commerce department is considering new regulations, and we comply with all applicable laws in the countries in which we operate,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\n\nCLOUD DEMAND IN CHINA\n\nThe Chinese entities are also seeking access to Microsoft's cloud services.\n\nIn April, Sichuan University said in a tender document it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Microsoft Azure OpenAI tokens to support the delivery of this project. The university's procurement document in May showed that Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd supplied the tokens.\n\nMicrosoft did not respond to requests for comment. Sichuan University and Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology did not respond to requests for comment on the purchase.\n\nOpenAI said in a statement its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft's policies. It did not comment on the tenders.\n\nThe University of Science and Technology of China's (USTC) Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research said in a tender document in March that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, for an unspecified purpose.\n\nThe tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider and Reuters could not determine its identity.\n\nUSTC was added to a U.S. export control list known as the 'Entity List' in May for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China's military, and involvement in its nuclear program development.\n\nUSTC and Hefei Advanced Computing Center did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBEYOND RESTRICTED AI CHIPS\n\nAmazon has offered Chinese organisations access not only to advanced AI chips but also to advanced AI models such as Anthropic's Claude which they cannot otherwise access, according to public posts, tenders and marketing materials reviewed by Reuters.\n\n\"Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic's Claude 3,\" Chu Ruisong, President of AWS Greater China, told a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May, referring to its cloud platform.\n\nIn various Chinese-language posts for AWS developers and clients, Amazon highlighted the opportunity to try out \"world-class AI models\" and mentioned Chinese gaming firm Source Technology as one of its clients using Claude.\n\nAmazon has dedicated sales teams serving Chinese clients domestically and overseas, according to two former company executives.\n\nAfter Reuters contacted Amazon for comment, it updated dozens of posts on its Chinese-language channels with a note to say some of its services were not available in its China cloud regions. It also removed several promotional posts, including the one about Source Technology. Amazon did not give a reason for removing the posts and did not answer a Reuters query on that.\n\n\"Amazon Bedrock customers are subject to Anthropic's end user license agreement, which prohibits access to Claude in China both via Amazon's Bedrock API (application programming interface) and via Anthropic's own API,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\n\nAnthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude.\n\n\"However, subsidiaries or product divisions of Chinese-headquartered companies may use Claude if the subsidiary itself is located in a supported region outside of China,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said.\n\nSource Technology did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n($1 = 7.1440 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld; Additional reporting by Krystal Hu, Alexandra Alper and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Thursday with focus turning to an address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for more cues on the bank’s plan to cut interest rates.\n\nFutures rose after Wall Street logged deep losses during the session, as investors were unnerved by data showing the U.S. labor market was in a much worse position than initially expected. Investors also pivoted out of heavyweight technology stocks, as caution grew ahead of key earnings from market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) next week.\n\nA rebound in the dollar and Treasury yields also pressured stock markets.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,603.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 19,628.25 points by 19:14 ET (23:14 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.1% to 40,881.0 points.\n\nPowell set to speak at Jackson Hole, rate cut cues in focus\n\nFed Chair Powell is set to speak at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday, and is widely expected to offer more cues on the central bank’s plans to begin cutting interest rates.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that Powell will explicitly flag a September rate cut, markets are pricing in with certainty that the central bank will trim rates next month. Traders are split over a 25 and 50 basis point reduction, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nRecent signs of a cooling U.S. economy- especially the labor market, drove increased expectations of lower interest rates. Data earlier this week showed a sharp downward revision in payrolls for the year to March 2024, indicating that any declines in payrolls seen in recent months were from a much lower base than initially expected.\n\nThe reading ramped up concerns that a sharply cooling labor market will put the economy on course for a hard landing and a potential recession.\n\nWall St hit by tech losses as yields rebound\n\nWall Street indexes clocked deep losses on Thursday, weighed chiefly by losses in technology stocks as traders rotated into more rate-sensitive sectors.\n\nA rebound in the dollar and Treasury yields also pressured growth stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% to 5,570.64 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1.6% to 17,626.07 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 40,712.78 points.\n\nChipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) slid 3.7% on Thursday, although it rose slightly in aftermarket trade, with focus turning to its quarterly earnings due next week.\n\nInvestors will be watching to see whether the company can justify an artificial intelligence-fuelled spike in valuation over the past year, which catapulted Nvidia to becoming the third-largest company on Wall Street.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise with Powell speech, rate cuts in focus\n\nAstraZeneca warns of shifting UK vaccine production to US, FT reports\n\nAs 7-Eleven's Japan owner weighs a bid, U.S. fans crave 'conbini' food\n\nView comments",

        "title": "4 Bitcoin Related Stocks in Focus as Fed Readies Rate Cut",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have suffered lately owing to the broader market selloff earlier this month, triggered by fears of a recession. However, fears have alleviated over the past two weeks, following the release of a spate of positive economic data that showed the U.S. economy is still holding strong.\n\nOn Aug 21, Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from its earlier lows and was trading above $60,770 after the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that hinted at the first rate cut in September.\n\nThis is likely to give Bitcoin a boost, as lower interest rates generally benefit growth-oriented assets, such as technology stocks, consumer discretionary goods, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nGiven this situation, Bitcoin-oriented stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. IBKR, Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD and Block, Inc. SQ are likely to benefit once the crypto rally resumes.\n\nRate Cuts to Help Crypto Market\n\nThe minutes of the FOMC’s July meeting revealed that the Federal Reserve is gearing up to start its easing cycle with a likely 25-basis point rate cut in September. The likely rate cut stems from the Federal Reserve’s confidence that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient and inflation is declining significantly to reach its 2% target.\n\nLower interest rates typically decrease the opportunity cost of holding assets that don’t generate yields, like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In an environment with lower interest rates, investors are more likely to pursue assets that offer higher potential returns, even if they carry more risk.\n\nThis shift makes cryptocurrencies, known for their historical volatility and potential for significant returns, more appealing to a wider range of investors.\n\nBitcoin on Track to Rebound\n\nBitcoin had a strong run in the first half of this year after a solid 2023. Bitcoin hit a record high of $73,750 on March 14.\n\nThis year’s rally gained momentum after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. The approval aims at providing both individual investors and large institutions with a regulated and accessible platform to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nHowever, the rally lost steam in April, and even the Bitcoin halving event failed to boost the price. The halving event, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks in half to limit the total Bitcoin supply to 21 million, usually sparks demand and pushes prices higher. Despite this, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline.\n\nThe rally picked up again in July but suddenly came to a halt earlier this month, with its price dropping to below $55,000. Bitcoin's price may remain rangebound for a while but the anticipated rate cut in September is likely to give Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market a boost.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto Stocks to Watch\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity AI said on Thursday that it plans to introduce advertising on its artificial intelligence-powered search platform by the fourth quarter.\n\nLast month, the AI startup launched a program for publishers with an initial batch of partners, including TIME, Der Spiegel, and Fortune, in which it plans to share revenue from interactions where a publisher's content is referenced.\n\nSince ChatGPT first launched in November 2022, major search engines have been trying to integrate AI into web search, and analysts have viewed AI-assisted search as a threat to Google's dominant position in the industry ever since the AI boom started.\n\nMicrosoft has adopted OpenAI technology for its Bing search engine through its early investment, while Google rolled out AI-powered summaries for the wider public at its developer conference in May.\n\nIn April, Perplexity AI raised $62.7 million from existing investors such as Nvidia, and new investors including Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator, and Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital.\n\nThe fundraising round valued the company at more than $1 billion, doubling its valuation from three months earlier.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This is a fair price range for Nvidia stock according to these analysts",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be one of the most demanded stocks in the tech sector, with Itau BBA analysts offering a detailed assessment of its prospects and a fair price range for the semiconductor company's shares.\n\nThe analysts recently reviewed several factors impacting Nvidia, including delays in the Blackwell chip and potential concerns around capital expenditure (capex) overbuild by major tech companies.\n\nDespite these challenges, Itau BBA expresses increasing confidence in Nvidia's earnings performance for the next two to three quarters.\n\nThey believe that the Blackwell delay, contrary to popular opinion, may actually serve as a tailwind for short-term numbers, particularly with the H200 chip proving more accretive than the B100 or B200 models.\n\nHowever, the analysts also highlight potential risks to Nvidia's implied growth in calendar year 2026 (CY26). \"To command a 30x P/E CY25, we believe that NVDA should have a CY26 EPS growth of at least 20%,\" writes Itau BBA.\n\nA capex exercise based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s spending suggests that if Nvidia continues to grow at these levels, Microsoft’s capex could reach 100% of its cash flow from operations or EBIT by FY26, raising concerns about sustainability.\n\nTo alleviate these concerns, the analysts point to the importance of faster AI adoption. They cite Microsoft's bullish tone in a recent earnings call, where a mass rollout of M365 Copilot was highlighted as a potential driver for increased AI infrastructure investment, which could benefit Nvidia.\n\n\"All-in, we continue to see NVDA delivering a USD5-6 EPS in CY25. However, we believe that we could see a semi infrastructure digestion at some point in CY26, adds the firm.\n\nItau BBA currently maintains its Outperform rating on the stock, explaining that its EPS projection could result in a fair price range of $150 to $180 a share for NVDA (based on a 30x P/E ratio).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThis is a fair price range for Nvidia stock according to these analysts\n\nNestle replaces CEO Schneider with company veteran Freixe\n\nWhat's behind Microsoft's annual segment changes?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's Why NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Has Caught The Eye Of Investors",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA's Improving Profits\n\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for NVIDIA to have grown EPS from US$0.19 to US$1.73 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of NVIDIA shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 17% to 60% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for NVIDIA.\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$3.1t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$123b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes NVIDIA Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering NVIDIA for a spot on your watchlist. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Recent ASML Sell-Off Is an Excellent Opportunity to Benefit From AI Tailwinds",
        "content": "ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) is perhaps the most critical company due to the technology it possesses in the semiconductor supply chain. Indeed, the company's lithography equipment is essential for producing the high-performance chips necessary for artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe Dutch company is headquartered and listed in the Netherlands and its American depositary receipt allows access to the U.S. investors. The stock has even been allocated a 98 out of 100 GF Score, which is fully justifiable, as we will see in this analysis. Recent ASML Sell-Off Is an Excellent Opportunity to Benefit From AI Tailwinds\n\nBusiness overview\n\nWhen analyzing a company, it is crucial to identify its moat, or competitive advantage, that will keep it ahead in the game. In the case of ASML, as with most tech companies, it is the monopolistic nature of its technology protected by patents. The company has the highest number of patents in machine learning followed by artificial intelligence and data science, according to Verdict.\n\nThe interesting part is the second quarter saw a spike in patenting activity by ASML, indicating it might soon reveal breakthrough innovations in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science.\n\nAs a leading supplier of advanced lithography equipment, including deep ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet systems, its cutting-edge technologies are essential for producing the high-performance chips necessary for AI applications. Companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) depend on ASML.\n\nFurther, the growth in AI demand is an amazing tailwind for ASML as chips powering generative AI applications depend on the company's technologies.\n\nStock performance\n\nWhile the stock has had a strong performance overall, the past several weeks have been challenging for shareholders as the stock declined over 20% in the month of July alone on fears of a general slowdown in the semiconductor sector. Chip companies Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia also recorded double-digit declines.\n\nWhen we zoom out on the chart, we can clearly see the picture has been rosy for existing shareholders over the long term. Recent ASML Sell-Off Is an Excellent Opportunity to Benefit From AI Tailwinds\n\nThe stock is up over 800% in the last 10 years and still up over 20% year to date despite the recent sell-off.\n\nFinancials and valuation\n\nASML has had impressive growth rates over a sustained period of time. Indeed, the company grew slightly over 18% per year in the past decade! Seven years recorded double-digit growth, while only three had (upper) single-digit growth rates.\n\nThis confirms that the stock is not a speculative asset; behind the share price action, there is tangible business expansion. The following chart is a great visual of the company's growing financials.\n\nStory continues Recent ASML Sell-Off Is an Excellent Opportunity to Benefit From AI Tailwinds\n\nASML additionally boasts a 48% return on equity, showing it is a high-margin and efficiently run business. Further, this indicates investments down the line will continue supporting high growth rates as the ROE remains high.\n\nHowever, the recent sell-off was spurred by second-quarter results that confirmed the absence of growth this year. This has somewhat made shareholders panic that the years of growth are behind it. It is expected for the business to have a growth rate in the 0% to 1% range in 2024, which is highly abnormal and caused the valuation to contract.\n\nCEO Peter Wennink blamed the results on a transition year due to macroeconomic uncertainty and China. Companies are ordering fewer chips as demand is weakening due to tight monetary policies across the globe, while at the same time trade restrictions and economic weakness in China significantly impact its business.\n\nAlthough growth is expected to be flat this year, it is likely that ASML's growth rates will reaccelerate back into the double digits in the next few years (GuruFocus tables a 15% revenue growth rate and 23% earnings per share average for the next three years). Indeed, with the soon-to-start monetary easing of most major banks as the economies slow and with Chinese trade barriers lifting as the U.S. election approaches, it is widely expected that the entire semiconductor sector will return to growth next year. If the sector grows, ASML's orders will also pick up.\n\nThe art of investing is the art of catching falling knives. While ASML is not exactly a falling knife, its shares have definitely dropped sufficiently to price in market fears of a slowdown and unlock the potential upside growth surprise that an investor could expect in 2025.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at 30 times forward earnings, which is the median it has been trading around for a decade. Without multiples expanding (which usually happens when interest rates are lower), the stock should at least follow the aforementioned 23% earnings per share growth rate. This should theoretically put the stock back above the $1,000 level and, therefore, be in line with most Wall Street analysts' estimates of $1,000 to $1,100 per share (roughly 25% upside).\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe key risk for the company is evident in the following chart. Recent ASML Sell-Off Is an Excellent Opportunity to Benefit From AI Tailwinds\n\nMore than half of ASML's revenue originates in Taiwan and China. The recurrent geopolitical tensions by U.S.-backed Taiwan and China cause some instability in the region, and even more so when it comes to critical semiconductor chips. With the prospect of new trade restrictions (and even trade wars), especially during and after a U.S. election year, poses some risk to the stock.\n\nHowever, there are mitigants to this overconcentration risk in a geopolitically turbulent region of the world. The first is that it is likely that this risk is already priced into the stock, given that markets are fully aware of the critical role ASML is playing. While the U.S. government might pressure the Netherlands to restrict ASML from selling its systems to China (the Biden administration has publicly refuted the rumor), it is quite unlikely the country will stop. It would result in sacrificing half of its business and seriously endanger the importance the country has in the semiconductor sector.\n\nThe second mitigant is that no country in the world has any interest in further disruption of already weakened semiconductor supply chains; semiconductor chips power everything, from mobile devices to critical defense systems. Therefore, these geopolitical tensions should somewhat lead to a continued status quo and allow ASML to continue growing to at least the semiconductor market's growth rate. The segment is expected to grow by 10% per annum until 2029, with most of the growth coming from China.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe stock has recently sold off on fears of a global slowdown in chips demand. However, the medium and long-term prospects of the semiconductor segment remain unaltered given the importance of the chips in all electronic devices.\n\nASML's technologies are not only important for corporations like Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia, but also for countries like the U.S., Taiwan and China. This should continue providing the stock with tailwinds as demand and growth rates pick up again in 2025. The stock has approximately 25% upside in a conservative scenario without multiple expansion and is, therefore, an attractive semiconductor play within a diversified portfolio or within an AI-oriented investment strategy.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor and Cars.com have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 22, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Taiwan Semiconductor TSM as the Bull of the Day and Cars.com CARS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on HCA Healthcare, Inc. HCA, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and General Motors Company GM.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nIt's never too frequent to talk about Taiwan Semiconductor, the preeminent \"lego builder\" for the AI revolution.\n\nMy colleague Ethan Feller just did a great analysis of the fundamentals two weeks ago and this week I wanted to go wide-angle on what their growth means for the global economy as they build a giant new foundry in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nHere was the video I made Monday morning where I showed the company growth, the huge buy opportunity I missed on August 5, and some details about the first US-based \"fab\" for the magicians of sub-10 nanometer chip technologies.\n\nWhy Is This Silicon Magician So Important?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (aka, TSMC) is a critical enabler of today’s technology industry, having fundamentally reshaped the semiconductor landscape in 1987. Through the vision and leadership of its founder Dr. Morris Chang, TSMC pioneered the pure-play semiconductor foundry business model.\n\nToday, TSMC’s semiconductors are the digital engines inside more than 12,000 electronic products created by over 500 companies. TSMC’s technology can be found in devices such as internet-connected home appliances (my coffee maker), smart phones and PCs, EVs and autonomous vehicles, cloud data centers, airlines and space-stations and AI-powered applications. The world’s biggest brands and savviest startups in technology rely on TSMC to unleash their innovations to the world.\n\nTSMC has since remained one of the world’s largest dedicated foundries with fabrication facilities (“fabs”) and subsidiaries spanning Asia, Europe and North America. Given persistent tensions between China and Taiwan, I'm sure it's not lost on my readers why bringing massive high-tech wafer fab production capacity to the US will secure the vital, global IP and technology that might otherwise be disrupted by trade wars, political wars, or even Southeast Asia \"hot\" wars.\n\nSultan of Silicon Builds Castles in US Desert\n\nIn the video linked above, I was trying to explore the TSMC website devoted to the new Arizona facility. But it was hard to navigate -- or maybe my internet connection speed was taking a nap.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even with perfect web speed, I still get so intense about what is unfolding with NVIDIA GPUs and the \"massively parallel architectures\" of AI, that I get tongue-tied trying to cram it all in to a sub-10 minute video.\n\nIt should be simply unfathomable to any of us that TSM is building circuit boards and chipsets with less than 5 nanometers of space between the transistors -- when the coronavirus is measured as big as 50 nanometers.\n\nThe accelerated generations of chip designs in terms of increased transistor density are all about a higher degree of miniaturization.\n\nThis is what Jensen Huang of NVIDIA showed us was going to happen as gaming GPUs took over the heavy lifting from Intel desk-top CPUs. In essence, as early as 2016, he saw that what I now call \"Huang's Law\" was going to overtake Moore's Law.\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Chips!\n\nYou can see an excellent graphic of that transformation here.\n\nBut in full transparency, it's actually beyond my intellectual pay-grade to be talking about the precise engineering world of nanometers in this article. Still, my massive enthusiasm will not be bridled by my mere ignorance.\n\nSo my simplest analogy has always been this: picture CPU-driven \"serial\" processing as a 4-lane highway, or 8-lane expressway. Obviously, traffic jams will still always happen any day of the week, no matter where your metro.\n\nNow, picture GPU-driven \"parallel\" processing as 100,000 piano players, all able to execute, process, and deliver new information and insights simultaneously. They could be a symphony, or an improv factory, with no traffic jams.\n\nThe Monolith of Phoenix\n\nAnd given that my fascination is far greater than my electrical engineering knowledge, I'm always willing to listen to Sensei Huang and his key partners like TSMC.\n\nSo here I will share some key details from that website about the Sultan of Silicon's latest magic mega-complex on over 1100 acres...\n\nIn a historic announcement, in May 2020, TSMC shared its plans to invest $12B in Phoenix, Arizona – building an advanced semiconductor manufacturing fabrication. In December 2022, the company announced its commitment to build a second fab in Phoenix, increasing its total investment to $40B.\n\nThen in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce and TSMC Arizona announced up to US$6.6 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act, fulfilling a goal to bring the most advanced chip manufacturing in the world to the United States. TSMC also announced plans to build a third fab at TSMC Arizona.\n\nThis third fab brings TSMC’s total U.S. investment to more than $65 billion, making this the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) in Arizona history, and the largest FDI in a greenfield project in U.S. history. Now with a third fab, TSMC Arizona will create approximately 6,000 jobs – and more than 20,000 accumulated unique construction jobs, as well as tens of thousands of indirect supplier jobs.\n\nAs one of TSMC’s advanced fabs, TSMC Arizona will play a vital role in the U.S. government’s goal to onshore semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen national economic competitiveness. TSMC Arizona’s first fab will operate it’s leading-edge semiconductor process technology (N4 process), starting production in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe second fab will utilize its leading edge N3 and N2 process technology and be operational in 2028. The recently announced third fab will manufacture chips using 2nm or even more advanced process technology, with production starting by the end of the decade. TSMC Arizona will be able to produce semiconductor wafers for its valued customers using the most advanced process capabilities in the country.\n\nThe Semi Cycle: Overdue for a Big Recession?\n\nOn Monday morning, when I decided I must profile TSM for the weekly Zacks Top Stock Picks video, two interesting items were already swirling through my brain:\n\n1) I had just published my weekly Sunday newsletter on LinkedIn about the new Microsoft mega-datacenter in my backyard in southeast Wisconsin: Microsoft Stargate: \"My god... it's full of GPUs!\"\n\n2) I had a dialog with a fellow investor-analyst who was wondering if the Semiconductor Cycle had peaked this year and was now due for a bigger correction/bear market.\n\nIf you've been watching since I first penned my Tech Super Cycle thesis in 2017, you know there are often many more dramatic bear markets in chip stocks than actual \"fall-off-a-cliff\" sales implosions.\n\nThoughts on the Semiconductor Cycle\n\nSo when a fellow investor-analyst asked me what I thought about a possible \"classic peak\" in the Semi Cycle, I quickly shared my thoughts to put the elements in perspective...\n\nThe SOX is ~140% off its 2022 bear market low.\n\nThe 17% correction in July was well within the bounds of expected volatility after such a run.\n\nAnd the \"panic of August\" was delicious for long-term growth managers.\n\nGPU demand isn't slowing. I profiled TSM for Top Picks today so I was just looking at rev growth for various players.\n\nIn wafer fab equipment AMAT is slowing but LRCX still looking at 16% topline into next year. ASML flat this year but projected 35% next year!\n\nAI has reinvented the cycle. No hype. Real capex. Ever since MSFT GOOG META were lined in early 2023 to buy GH200 series, the other 997 corps in Fortune 1000 knew they had to build their own internal LLMs or go extinct. NVIDIA won't be able to make new GB200 series fast enough.\n\n(end of my back-of-the-envelope bull case for chips and NVDA since 2022)\n\nMinimum 30% CAGR, While NVDA Grows 50%+\n\nThen, on Monday afternoon I was alerted to the latest research publication from Daniel Newman at Futurum Group, an independent technology research firm. Dan knows TSM and NVDA and their forward growth catalysts as well (probably better) than I do.\n\nAnd he got his research report profiled on CNBC with this headline: \"The AI data center chipset market is set to soar from $38B in 2024 to $138B by 2028, driven by a 30% CAGR.\"\n\nI think he's being way too conservative, especially when NVIDIA already had a clear path to $1 trillion in topline (including software services) even before the earthquake of ChatGPT surfaced in early 2023.\n\nFinally, here was my LinkedIn newsletter on Sunday profiling the virtues of Satya Nadella and Brad Smith, for Wisconsin and beyond...\n\nMicrosoft Stargate: \"My god... it's full of GPUs!\"\n\nIf that link doesn't work, just email me at KCook@Zacks.com\n\nBottom line: As I described in my video, be ready for more volatility this autumn and into the election. If stocks have another one-day \"panic\" like they did for the Bank of Japan carry trade, be ready to buy. Because the global-macro picture isn't going to shipwreck the megatrend of AI hyper-scalers, LLM-builders, and pure science-explorers who want to improve the world we live in.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCars.com is a small-cap operator of an online automotive platform. The company offers new and used vehicle listings, expert and consumer reviews, and research tools.\n\nThe Chicago-based firm is also engaged in the sale of display advertising to national advertisers.\n\nThe reason CARS fell into the cellar of the Zacks Rank is because EPS estimates dropped recently with the Zacks Consensus for this year slid 12% from $1.98 to $1.74.\n\nThe catalyst for this downward revision was the company's August 8 earnings release.\n\nStill Profitable, But Slipping\n\nCars.com came out with quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -19.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online automotive marketplace would post earnings of $0.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of -87.50%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.\n\nCars.com, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $178.89 million for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $168.18 million.\n\nThe good news is that CARS has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nAfter the report, JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Neutral from Overweight and slashed their price target from $25 to $19.\n\nBottom line: While CARS shares are attractive on a P/E basis, investors should wait at least another quarter until estimates stop going down and stabilize. The Zacks Rank will let you know.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nJackson Hole Event is Bullish for Stocks: HCA, RCL, GM to Gain\n\nCentral bank officials worldwide would meet in Jackson Hole to discuss monetary policies and their implications on economic growth. The Jackson Hole Symposium will be held from Aug 22-24 and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give a speech on Friday.\n\nStocks have, traditionally, risen in the weeks before and after the Jackson Hole event. The gauge of U.S. large caps — the S&P 500 — registered an average return of 0.9% in the two weeks around Jackson Hole since 2010, per Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.\n\nThe S&P 500, except for once, has scaled upward around the Jackson Hole conference that Powell attended, added Colas. In 2022, Powell had to implement aggressive monetary policies to curb relentless price pressures, eventually dragging the S&P 500 down in the two weeks around the Jackson Hole meeting. He acknowledged that households and businesses must endure pain as the Fed introduced a slew of interest rate hikes.\n\nHave a look at the S&P 500’s returns that Colas is referring to, citing a MarketWatch article:\n\nHowever, unlike 2022, things are looking much brighter now as most market participants expect Powell to hint at an interest rate cut soon in the gathering as inflationary pressures have subsided. Interest rate cuts would increase consumer outlays, lower borrowing costs, enhance economic growth, and lift the stock market.\n\nAt the same time, weakness in the U.S. housing market has strengthened hopes of a swift implementation of interest rate cuts to help the economy chug along. Almost 67.5% of traders expect the Fed to trim interest rates by 25 basis points in the September policy meeting, per CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nBy the way, consumers have shown enough signs of resilience in a higher interest rate environment. Consumers continue to splurge on discretionary items, with sales at U.S. retailers rebounding in July, a tell-tale sign that the economy is poised to grow and boost stock market returns\n\nTalking about returns, the S&P 500 has bounced back from an early August swoon. After recording its worst day on Aug 5 since 2022, the broader index has notched eight straight winning sessions till Aug 19 for the first time this year,\n\nBanking on such positives, it’s prudent for astute investors to place bets on S&P 500 growth stocks such as HCA Healthcare, Inc., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and General Motors Company that can make the most of the encouraging period surrounding the Jackson Hole gathering.\n\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\n\nHCA Healthcare\n\nHCA Healthcare is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the United States. HCA Healthcare, currently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 6.1% over the past 60 days. HCA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 16.8%.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. Royal Caribbean Cruises, presently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 3.7% over the past 60 days. RCL’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69.9%.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGeneral Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers. General Motors, currently, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 5.7% over the past 60 days. GM’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.4%.\n\nShares of HCA Healthcare, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and General Motors have gained 38.7%, 22.7%, and 28%, respectively, so far this year.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Big Data Stock To Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other big data stocks.\n\nThe global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\n\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today’s competitive landscape.\n\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market’s growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\n\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\n\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Best Big Data Stock To Buy Now?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 5.40%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $131.31\n\nNumber ten on our list of ten best big data stocks to buy now is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company makes chips that are used to facilitate big data use cases. The average analyst price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is $131.31, indicating a potential upside of 5.40% as of August 16. Analysts consider NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a strong buy ahead of its August 28 earnings report. Despite a 35% drop, the stock rebounded and may surge again. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leader in the AI market, stands to benefit from the sector’s rapid growth, projected to expand from $184 billion in 2024 to $826 billion by 2030. Analysts believe the company’s current 78% gross margin may decline due to competition, but this isn’t an immediate concern. With a forward P/E ratio of around 40 for fiscal 2025, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued earnings growth could drive its stock higher, making it a solid long-term buy despite potential risks.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages.

        "title": "If You Invested $1000 in Nvidia a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",
        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nNvidia's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores, which are necessary to run deep learning algorithms. The company’s GPU platforms are playing a major role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets like robotics and self-driving vehicles.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is a dominant name in the Data Center, professional visualization and gaming markets where Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are playing a catch-up role. The company’s partnership with almost all major cloud service providers (CSPs) and server vendors is a key catalyst.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s GPUs are also getting rapid adoption in diverse fields ranging from radiology to precision agriculture. The company’s GPUs power the top supercomputer in the world, located at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States, as well as the top supercomputers in Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nSanta Clara, CA-based, NVIDIA reported revenues of $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024, up 126% from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nBeginning first-quarter fiscal 2021, NVIDIA started reporting revenues under two segments – Graphics and Compute & Networking.\r\n\r\nGraphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.\r\n\r\nCompute & Networking comprises Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms. Mellanox revenues included in this segment beginning second-quarter fiscal 2021.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Compute & Networking accounted for 22% and 78% of fiscal 2024 revenues, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Nvidia ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in August 2014 would be worth $269,533.30, or a 26,853.33% gain, as of August 22, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 182.12% and the price of gold increased 88.92% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for NVDA.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 41.2% through fiscal 2025-2027. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nShares have gained 12.47% over the past four weeks and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings preview: Blackwell delay should not impact near-term results",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a key player in the AI boom of the past two years, is set to report its second-quarter earnings for fiscal 2025 next week. Among other things, investors will largely be on the lookout for any updates from management regarding possible delays in the launch of the next-generation Blackwell (BW) chip.\n\nSupply chain checks suggest performance challenges, leading to a chip respin with the Blackwell tile and causing a one-quarter delay, however, this \"is not expected to have any impact to near-term results and guidance,” according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts.\n\n“We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,” they added.\n\nKeyBanc’s team expects Nvidia to report strong beat-and-raise results, driven by robust demand for Hopper GPUs.\n\nDue to the Blackwell delay, the chipmaker is expected to focus on ramping up the B200 for hyperscalers, effectively canceling the B100, which will be replaced by a lower-cost, performance-optimized B200A GPU aimed at enterprise customers.\n\nWhile the GB200 ramp has been affected, modest shipments of NVL36/72 are still expected in the fourth fiscal quarter. Despite the delay, the analysts maintain their FY26 revenue and EPS estimates of $222 billion and $5.16, respectively, versus consensus of $168 billion and $3.79.\n\nThey believe the risk-reward profile for Nvidia stock is favorable at current valuations.\n\nAnalysts at Raymond James shared similar remarks ahead of Nvidia’s earnings. They anticipate another strong print from the AI darling despite the noise surrounding Blackwell delays.\n\n“Recent commentary from hyperscale customers and results from supply chain partners point to continued strength in AI infrastructure builds,” they commented.\n\n“We have modeled a modest contribution from Blackwell in FQ3 and expect any delays to drive upside to Hopper GPUs in the short term, which could actually benefit gross margins.”\n\nFurthermore, Raymond James highlights the Spectrum-X Ethernet switch as a crucial near-term revenue driver for Nvidia, largely independent of the Blackwell ramp. \r\nWhile a prolonged delay could heighten the risk of customers pausing their spending, the analysts remain confident in Nvidia’s execution capabilities.\n\nThey stay optimistic that B100/B200 boards will ship this year, followed by GB200 NVL rack systems in the first half of 2025.\n\nLastly, Citi analysts forecast a fresh 52-week high for Nvidia stock after the report, driven by expectations of higher consensus estimates for the June and October quarters, and reassuring Blackwell comments from Nvidia’s management.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings preview: Blackwell delay should not impact near-term results\n\nCanada's CN Rail, CPKC lockout workers after talks fail, sparks economic damage fears\n\nUS auto safety regulator closes probe into GM's Cruise robotaxis\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "The rise of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been nothing short of incredible. No company has grown as quickly as Nvidia at the scale that it is. But that's all in the past; investors want to know what's in store for Nvidia stock in the future.\n\nThe problem is that Nvidia's future is extremely cloudy. While it could continue its rapid growth, it could face challenges with its primary products.\n\nNvidia's GPU growth has been phenomenal\n\nNvidia's primary products are graphics processing units (GPUs). These hardware pieces were originally intended to process gaming graphics quickly, but their use case has expanded beyond that. GPUs can run engineering simulations, research drugs, mine cryptocurrency, and, most importantly, train artificial intelligence (AI) models. The latter has contributed substantially to Nvidia's rise during the past year and a half.\n\nGPUs are a top pick for running enormous workloads because they can split a calculation into multiple parts and compute in parallel. Furthermore, GPUs can be combined in a server to multiply this effect. In fact, the primary limitation to building one of these powerful servers to run AI models on is a company's checkbook size.\n\nThe explosive growth AI has provided can be seen in Nvidia's data center revenue, which rose 427% year over year to $22.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28). Perhaps more impressive is that it rose 23% quarter over quarter, which shows demand is still rapidly increasing. All things being equal, if a company increases its quarter-over-quarter revenue by 25%, the quarterly revenue would have more than doubled by the end of the year. Nvidia is right at that mark, and the quarter-over-quarter revenue is one of the best signs to examine and see if demand for its GPUs is still there.\n\nAdditionally, the largest tech companies have indicated to investors that they plan to continue increasing their spending to build up computing power for AI demand. This bodes well for Nvidia because it needs its clients to continue spending to stay afloat.\n\nBut there may be more to the story.\n\nNvidia's profit margin is at a record level\n\nThere's an old saying: \"Your margins are my opportunity.\" And this could become an issue for Nvidia. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nNvidia's gross and profit margins have widened to record levels, which is fantastic for investors. But they may be unsustainably high. Some of its largest clients have already developed their own chips in-house to replace GPUs for their AI computing infrastructure. This is likely in response to the high prices they must pay for GPUs.\n\nTake Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU), for example. When an AI workload is properly configured, the TPU can achieve much higher performance than a GPU. With each major cloud computing company having its own product, it could become an issue for Nvidia.\n\nStill, GPUs are fantastic at running AI models and will continue to be used heavily, but investors should be wary because Nvidia's margins may soon come under pressure.\n\nIf Nvidia's profit margin returns to its previous high peak of about 40%, it will take about 42% more revenue just to generate the same profits it can generate now at its 57% profit margin. That's concerning because Nvidia is already priced at a premium. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nSo, what might Nvidia's stock look like in three years? I'd say the company will still be a stalwart, producing an incredible number of GPUs to satisfy the demand for AI. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock around the same levels due to margin compression.\n\nThis is an underrated consideration when investing in Nvidia. I think investors need to consider the possibility that even if its revenue continues to increase rapidly, its profit margin must stay elevated for the stock to make sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia's Big Stock Pullback Will Lead to Even Bigger Gains by Year's End",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most-watched tech stock. There's no question. Its upcoming earnings, which come after the majority of the industry and all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have already reported, are hotly anticipated.\n\nAs the centerpiece of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, Nvidia saw its revenue skyrocket from the end of 2022 to now. It couldn't sell its Superchips fast enough -- literally, at its peak, there was an 11-month backlog for them. This extreme demand led to incredible pricing power and the ability, it seemed, to print money.\n\nFor the last four consecutive quarters, Nvidia grew its earnings per share (EPS) by more than 400% year over year. The market reacted, sending the company's stock on a rapid ascent, more than tripling from July 2023 through July 2024. Maybe some investors thought the ride would never stop, but since its peak in mid-July, the stock is down about 8%.\n\nIt's natural for a stock to cool off at times. However, there's been some outsized fear surrounding this dip for many investors worried about a possible recession, Nvidia's income growth slowing significantly, or AI failing to deliver on its promise. While these fears are valid, and skepticism is healthy, I think Nvidia has a ways to go.\n\nAny short-term retreat like this is just that, short-term. Although Nvidia's next earnings may not blow estimates out of the water like some of its previous quarters -- expectations are higher these days -- I think they will still meet or exceed them, and the market will react as it has all year when Nvidia posts its numbers. I think this trend will continue, and Nvidia's share price will continue to rise through the rest of the year.\n\nI won't go into detail about a recession; just remember to take warnings about an impending one with a grain of salt. Yes, there have been some concerning numbers, like the last jobs report, but this is a long way from full sirens and flashing red lights. There is still a lot the Federal Reserve can do to steer the economy in the right direction. It is too premature to say one is coming.\n\nLet's take a look at the other two concerns.\n\nBig tech's spending spree isn't slowing -- that's good news for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's incredible revenue growth is driven primarily by tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. These firms are constantly upgrading and expanding their data centers to meet the massive AI-driven demands, and at the heart of these data centers are Nvidia's chips.\n\nThe cash flowing into Nvidia isn't slowing because the cash flowing out of big tech isn't slowing. During recent earnings calls, CEOs from around Silicon Valley emphasized the need to increase their AI-focused investments. Alphabet, which spent around $31 billion in capital expenditures in 2023, is on track to spend about $50 billion this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn tech, the worst thing you can do is get left behind. As Alphabet's CEO put it in its call, \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Now, Nvidia has to defend its market share, but it's clear the faucet isn't getting shut off just yet.\n\nThere are signs that AI is starting to deliver returns\n\nThis tech is still new. It's easy to forget that. A lot of people have been concerned, myself included, that the real-world value of AI just isn't adding up to its enormous cost. I think this is definitely something to continue to watch, but for now, there are positive signs. The biggest of which, in my opinion, is Meta's earnings call.\n\nMeta posted 22% year-over-year revenue growth and a whopping 73% jump in earnings per share year-over-year. During the company's earnings call, Zuckerberg credited AI for improving content algorithms, boosting engagement, and, ultimately, helping increase advertising revenue.\n\nThere have also been studies showing other companies are benefiting. An International Data Corporation (IDC) study last fall surveyed more than 2000 businesses around the world. The researchers found that companies averaged a $3.5 return for every $1 they invested in AI. That's pretty impressive. I should point out that this was commissioned by Microsoft, so keep that in mind, but it was independently conducted by IDC.\n\nHow this bears out in the long run is still to be seen, but there is reason to believe AI could fulfill its promise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "The tech industry has created many millionaires over the years. Since 2014, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has risen 377%, delivering considerably more growth than the S&P 500's 184% increase. Macroeconomic concerns have caused a dip in the market over the last month, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down about 7%.\n\nHowever, the decline is precisely why keeping a long-term perspective when investing in tech is crucial. The industry benefits from consistent innovations and investments from the companies pushing the market forward. As a result, it's no accident that the world's top five most valuable companies are all heavily active in tech, leading industries such as consumer products, chip design, productivity software, cloud computing, e-commerce, and more.\n\nThese sectors are continuing to expand today, boosted by advances in related technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), meaning it's not too late for new investors to see big gains over the next decade. So, here are two top tech stocks that could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nWhether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) meteoric rise since the start of 2023. The company's market cap was at about $360 billion at the beginning of last year and has since skyrocketed 751% to more than $3 trillion, becoming the first chipmaker to achieve such a feat.\n\nNvidia has dominated the graphics processing unit (GPU) space for years, with its desktop GPU market share steadily rising from 65% in 2014 to 88% in 2024. For much of that time, the company's success came from selling its GPUs directly to consumers who used the chips to build high-performance gaming and video editing PCs.\n\nHowever, the emergence of AI has shifted data center chip demand away from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs, with Nvidia perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to countless companies. GPUs are critical to AI development, as they can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Consequently, Nvidia's stock and earnings soared in recent months. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis chart shows the massive financial gains Nvidia has enjoyed since the start of 2023, as sales for its AI GPUs have skyrocketed. The company hit $15 billion in quarterly free cash flow this year, far surpassing its rivals. Fellow chipmaker AMD's free cash flow reached $439 million, while Intel's is at a negative $3 billion.\n\nNvidia's stellar earnings gains don't just help it in AI but across tech. With more cash reserves than its competitors, the company has the means to follow the market and continue investing in its tech, whether the industry moves closer to self-driving vehicles, virtual/augmented reality, or another sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high at 46. However, that figure isn't much higher than its five-year average of 42, when Nvidia's stock rose more than 3,000%. As a result, Nvidia is worth considering right now as a stock that could make you a millionaire.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is no stranger to turning people into millionaires, with its stock up 430,000% since its initial public offering in 1986. The company has reached historic heights thanks to the success of homegrown brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn. These products played to Microsoft's strengths as a king of software, allowing it to achieve positions in tech sectors like operating systems, productivity software, cloud computing, video games, social media, and more.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft's reach in tech is vast, with growth catalysts throughout the industry. The company has earned a reputation for reliability thanks to consistent stock and financial growth. Over the last five years alone, Microsoft's revenue and operating income have steadily risen 96% and 120%, respectively. Meanwhile, quarterly free cash flow has increased by 123% to $23 billion.\n\nMicrosoft has used its massive gains to regularly reinvest in its business. In 2019, with seemingly the foresight of the century, the company invested $1 billion into ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That figure has since swelled to an estimated $13 billion, granting Microsoft access to some of the most advanced AI models on the market.\n\nThe collaboration has seen Microsoft implement AI across its software offerings, with new tools available on Azure and a range of generative features on its productivity platforms. The Windows company's AI expansion has boosted its entire business, with revenue up 16% year over year in fiscal 2024 and operating income up 24%. The period delivered impressive growth in productivity and cloud computing, with sales in these respective segments increasing by 12% and 20%.\n\nMicrosoft's P/E of 35 doesn't exactly scream bargain. However, it also doesn't tell the whole story. The figure is only slightly higher than the company's 10-year average P/E of 32, indicating its stock doesn't often go on sale. The company's stock has risen 834% over the last decade, suggesting it remains a compelling way to invest in tech right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Before They Soar 47% and 57%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Smart investors pay attention to stock splits because they are often an indirect indicator of quality businesses. To elaborate, forward stock splits are only necessary after substantial and sustained share price appreciation, and that rarely happens to mediocre businesses.\n\nNot surprisingly, stocks that split tend to beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), at least temporarily, according to Bank of America. Since 1980, stocks have generated an average return of 25% during the one-year period following a stock split announcement, while the S&P 500 returned 12% during the same period.\n\nThis year, Walmart(NYSE: WMT) announced a 3-for-1 stock split on Jan. 30, and completed the split after market close on Feb. 23. Shares have surged 35% since the announcement, but Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley has set a bull-case target of $109 per share. That forecast implies 47% upside from its current share price of $74.\n\nSimilarly, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, and completed the split after market close on June 7. Shares have surged 34% since the announcement, but Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann has set a target of $200 per share. That forecast implies 57% upside from its current share price of $127.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Walmart and Nvidia.\n\n1. Walmart\n\nWalmart is the largest retailer in the world and the second-largest e-commerce business in the United States. That scale affords the company an important cost advantage. It can buy inventory from suppliers in bulk and pass savings to consumers. In turn, Walmart can sell a wide assortment of products at low prices, including perishable groceries that online retailers typically lack.\n\nThe promise of bargain prices across a broad range of goods brings consumers to Walmart more frequently than any other superstore. The company accounted for 62% of superstore visits during the first four months of 2024, according to Placer.ai. That consistent foot traffic reinforces the ubiquity of the Walmart brand, keeping the company top of mind for consumers.\n\nWalmart reported encouraging financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 4.8% to $169 billion on particularly strong sales growth in e-commerce, membership fees, and advertising. Meanwhile, gross profit margin expanded 43 basis points because of pricing power, lower delivery costs per order, and a sales mix shift toward more profitable products like advertising services. In turn, non-GAAP net income increased 10% to $0.67 per diluted share.\n\nCEO Doug McMillon said, \"Each part of our business is growing -- store and club sales are up, e-commerce is compounding as we layer on pickup and even faster growth in delivery as our speed improves.\" He also said new businesses like advertising, memberships, and the online marketplace for third-party merchants are \"diversifying profits and reinforcing the resilience of our business model.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 10% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 31 times earnings look expensive, which makes the 47% return implied by Morgan Stanley's bull-case price target seem unlikely. Personally, I would keep Walmart on my watchlist until shares look a little cheaper.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia accounted for 98% of data center graphics processing unit (GPU) shipments last year, and its market share was similar in the previous year. GPUs can perform technical calculations more quickly and efficiently than central processing units (CPUs), which makes them good at accelerating demanding workloads like rendering 3D graphics, training machine learning models, and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nNvidia's long-standing dominance in data center GPUs means the company was perfectly positioned to benefit when ChatGPT launched in 2022, eliciting an exponential increase in demand for AI infrastructure. Nvidia holds over 80% market share in AI chips, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia reported first-quarter financial results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue surged 262% to $26 billion on momentum in the data center segment. That was fueled by \"strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jump 461% to $6.12 per diluted share.\n\nInvestors should know that shipments of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs -- chips that offer faster training and inference speeds than the previous Hopper architecture -- will be delayed by three months. Technology-focused news company The Information broke the story earlier this month, citing design flaws discovered \"unusually late in the production process\" as the reason for the delay.\n\nManagement will likely address the issue when the company announces second-quarter financial results on Aug. 28. The stock could move sharply in either direction depending on the context, so shareholders should be ready. That said, the long-term investment thesis remains intact. Nvidia GPUs are the industry standard in AI computing, and the graphics processor market is forecasted to grow at 28% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to grow at 39% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). In that context, the current valuation of 71 times adjusted earnings looks a little expensive, so I doubt Nvidia will return 57% in the next 12 months. However, I think investors can buy a small position in the stock today, provided they are comfortable with the possibility of a significant decline post earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sold 79% of Citadel's Stake in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Titan Nvidia and Piled Into These 3 High-Octane Growth Stocks Instead",
        "content": "What can easily be described as the most important data release of the third quarter occurred last week -- and a lot of investors probably missed it.\n\nEvery quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In simple terms, a 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's most-successful investors purchased and sold in the most recent quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmong the many anticipated 13F filings from billionaire asset managers is that of Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel Advisors. Since its inception, no hedge fund has been more profitable than Citadel, which often hedges its common stock positions with various put and call options.\n\nWhat's noteworthy about Citadel's latest 13F is that Griffin and his investment team were big-time sellers of artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and avid buyers of three other high-octane growth stocks.\n\nKen Griffin's Citadel sold more than 9.2 million shares of Nvidia\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia has been virtually unstoppable. Shares are up more than 700% and the company's market cap has increased by north of $2.7 trillion.\n\nNvidia's hardware and software have fueled this historic gain. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has quickly become the standard in AI-accelerated data centers running generative AI solutions and training large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, Nvidia's CUDA software platform is the toolkit developers use to build LLMs. The company's hardware and software are working in-tandem to keep AI-driven businesses loyal to Nvidia's ecosystem of products and services.\n\nDespite these first-mover advantages, Griffin's Citadel sold 9,282,018 shares of Nvidia during the June-ended quarter, ultimately reducing its stake by 79.3%.\n\nAlthough profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, history may be playing a meaningful role in this decision.\n\nOver the previous 30 years, there hasn't been a high-profile innovation, technology, or trend that's escaped an early innings bubble-bursting event. Investors are always overly optimistic with regard to how quickly they expect a new technology or innovation to take hold. Should AI follow the path of previous next-big-thing innovations, no company would be hit harder by the AI bubble bursting than Nvidia.\n\nThere's also a high likelihood of Nvidia shedding its monopoly like market share in high-compute data centers, as well as losing its pristine pricing power on AI-GPUs, over time. Its inability to meet overwhelming enterprise demand for GPUs, coupled with many of its top customers developing chips for their data centers, makes it likely that Nvidia will lose out on precious data center \"real estate.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBut while Ken Griffin and his investment crew were sending shares of Nvidia packing, they were busy piling into three supercharged growth stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir Technologies (5,222,682 shares purchased)\n\nThe first fast-paced stock that had the investment team at Citadel's hedge fund mashing the buy button with regularity during the second quarter is cloud-based data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). The more than 5.22 million shares purchased increased Citadel's stake in Palantir by 1,140% over where things stood on March 31, 2024.\n\nThe primary lure of Palantir as an investment is the company's irreplaceability. Though other businesses offer bits and pieces of the services it supports, no company at scale comes close to matching what Palantir offers as a whole. Wall Street typically places a hearty valuation premium on businesses that can sustain their unique moats.\n\nFor quite some time, the bulk of Palantir's sustained double-digit sales growth has come from its AI-fueled Gotham platform. This is the cloud-based infrastructure that helps governments plan missions and gather data.\n\nHowever, Gotham's long-term growth ceiling is somewhat limited. Since Palantir's management team isn't going to let certain governments access its platform for national security reasons (e.g., China), it's the company's Foundry platform that's likely to drive significant growth in sales and cash flow in the years to come.\n\nFoundry is Palantir's relatively new AI-inspired platform focused on businesses. It's designed to, among other things, help businesses better understand their data so they can streamline their operations. Over the trailing year, ended June 30, Palantir's commercial customer count surged 55% to 467. Since it's still in its very early stages of expansion, it should have no trouble supporting double-digit sales growth.\n\nPinterest (4,472,384 shares purchased)\n\nA second supercharged growth stock that Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund was a buyer of as it was disposing of the lion's share of its Nvidia stake during the June-ended quarter is social media platform Pinterest(NYSE: PINS). To offer some context on just how much this position grew, Citadel only held 12,909 shares of Pinterest at the end of March.\n\nAlthough Pinterest's third-quarter sales guidance left a lot to be desired among Wall Street analysts who had been expecting a big upside revenue guide, there's no denying that this company is picking up momentum as it adds to its monthly active user (MAU) count.\n\nWhen the June quarter came to a close, Pinterest had increased its global MAUs by a cool 12% to 522 million from the previous year. The more active users Pinterest has on its platform, the more likely it is to command strong ad-pricing power with businesses. After all, Pinterest's users are often potential shoppers looking for ideas and inspiration.\n\nAnother reason Pinterest is such a success story is the way its social media platform is set up. Users are willingly and (most importantly!) freely sharing the things, places, and services that interest them. With app developers giving consumers the option to remove data-tracking tools, the premise of Pinterest's site ensures that it'll be able to provide relevant data to merchants to help them target users with their message(s).\n\nPinterest is also swimming with available capital. As of the midpoint of 2024, it had more than $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and no debt. This treasure chest of cash, coupled with a $1 billion share repurchase program, gives the company the ability to navigate challenging economic climates with ease.\n\nBroadcom (1,880,740 shares purchased)\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of all is that Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund was busy scooping up shares of AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) while sending 79% of its position in Nvidia to the chopping block. The 1,880,740 shares of Broadcom purchased by Griffin's fund increased its stake by nearly 64% from the sequential quarter.\n\nOn one hand, Broadcom would presumably be exposed to some degree of downside if the AI bubble were to burst. Though its AI networking solutions, which are used to reduce tail latency and maximize the computing capability of GPUs in enterprise data centers, are in high demand, a bubble-bursting event would, undoubtedly, weigh on growth in AI networking sales.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a lot more going on with Broadcom than just artificial intelligence-related solutions. It's one of the largest suppliers of 5G wireless solutions used in next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies upgrading their networks to support faster 5G download speeds have created a steady device replacement cycle that's fueled demand for Broadcom's products.\n\nBroadcom also makes an assortment of solutions for next-gen vehicles, including products for advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment systems, and various LED lights. In other words, as the automotive industry and industrial sector, in general, become more reliant on technology, Broadcom's products are only going to grow more popular.\n\nAcquisitions have been important to Broadcom's ascent, as well. The $69 billion purchase of cloud virtualization software company VMware, which closed in November 2023, provides an important path for Broadcom to expand its reach within private and hybrid enterprise clouds.\n\nLong story short, Broadcom looks to be better positioned than Nvidia if and when the AI bubble bursts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget the Fed: Thanks to Nvidia, Aug. 28 Might be an Even Bigger Day for the Stock Market",
        "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady since August 2023, when it last raised the federal funds rate to a 23-year high of 5.33%. But with inflation cooling and the unemployment rate ticking up, many Wall Street pundits predict the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on Sept. 17 and 18.\n\nFalling interest rates are typically good for the stock market -- and I'll explain why in a moment -- but since a September rate cut is now widely expected, it's unlikely to have a substantial impact on the market. Instead, I think investors should be focused on Aug. 28, which is the date Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will report its earnings for the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 31).\n\nNvidia stock has soared 187% over the past year alone on the back of the company's blockbuster financial results, so here's why its upcoming report could have a much bigger effect on investor sentiment than the Fed meeting.\n\nNvidia is the AI industry's bellwether\n\nNvidia designs the most powerful data center chips for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. Demand is outstripping supply and it's coming from a broad customer base, which includes established tech giants like Microsoft, and start-ups like ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processor (GPU) set the benchmark for the AI industry last year. Some tech companies have built clusters of over 100,000 GPUs, and considering they sell for up to $40,000 each, this has quickly become a multibillion-dollar market annually. In fact, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks data center operators will spend $1 trillion upgrading and expanding their infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nThose operators include Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, to name a few. They build data centers, fill them with Nvidia's GPUs, and rent the computing capacity to businesses and developers who use it to create and deploy AI. Huang says data center operators can earn $5 in revenue over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia's chips, so it's a lucrative business for all parties.\n\nNvidia had a market share of over 90% in 2023, so it's positioned to capture a significant chunk of that $1 trillion in value -- depending how quickly the competition catches up. Most chip makers are releasing their own GPUs and benchmarking them against the H100, but Nvidia has already launched the H200 which can perform AI inference at twice the speed of its predecessor.\n\nPlus, next year, Nvidia will begin shipping high volumes of its next-generation GPUs which are built on its new Blackwell architecture. The Blackwell-based GB200, for example, will be capable of performing AI inference five-times faster than the H100, so it's a substantial leap. AI developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, so faster chips can translate to significant cost savings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat will buoy demand for Nvidia's latest chips, and we should learn more about the rollout in the company's Aug. 28 report.\n\nNvidia is set for another blockbuster quarter\n\nAccording to Nvidia's guidance, the company will show $28 billion in total revenue when it reports its results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter. That's much higher than the $26.6 billion forecast Wall Street originally expected, but analysts have since revised their consensus estimate to $28.5 billion. That means Nvidia's own guidance might even be too conservative!\n\nIt's no surprise, because Nvidia has made a habit of beating expectations. In the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), the company delivered $26 billion in total revenue which was well above its original guidance of $24 billion, and also above Wall Street's estimate of $24.6 billion.\n\nThe result was headlined by $22.6 billion in data center revenue alone, which represented a whopping 427% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nThat's the number investors should watch in the upcoming Q2 report. Anything above Wall Street's estimate of $25 billion will be a positive read-through for tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. It's a direct reflection of their AI infrastructure spending, which represents their confidence in the technology going forward.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet account for 20.4% of the entire value of the S&P 500 index. Meta Platforms and Tesla, who are also big buyers of Nvidia's GPUs, together account for another 3.8% of the index.\n\nTherefore, this group of tech companies could influence the direction of the overall stock market going forward, which is why I think so much is hinging on Nvidia's Aug. 28 report. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia could be more important than the Fed over the next month\n\nInterest rate cuts can be good for the stock market because they reduce the yield on risk-free assets like cash and Treasuries, pushing investors into growth assets like stocks and real estate instead. Plus, lower rates will allow companies to borrow more money to fuel growth, and companies with existing debt could see their repayments fall, which is a tailwind for their earnings.\n\nHowever, history suggests the S&P 500 could suffer a temporary decline once the Fed starts cutting interest rates. In past instances, the Fed was cutting because of dire economic conditions -- like the dotcom tech crash in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The S&P 500 fell on each occasion.\n\nWhile there is no sign of an impending crisis in the U.S. economy right now, unemployment has ticked higher to 4.3% (from 3.7% in January), which is a sign there could be weakness on the horizon, especially in areas like consumer spending. If the economy does slow, that will hurt corporate earnings which could send the stock market lower, even while the Fed is slashing rates.\n\nWith that said, the CME Group's FedWatch tool assigns a 100% probability to a September rate cut, and since the economy is still quite strong, it shouldn't trigger a negative response from investors.\n\nFor that reason, I attach far more weight to Nvidia's upcoming earnings report on Aug. 28, because it genuinely has the potential to influence the direction of the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Growth Stocks Could Start Soaring After Nvidia's Quarterly Earnings on Aug. 28",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is set to release its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results (for the three months ended July 28) on Aug. 28. The market is eagerly looking forward to the chip giant's numbers, considering that it is playing a pioneering role in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile there have been concerns of late about Nvidia's ability to sustain its AI-fueled growth, a closer look at recent developments indicates that the company could indeed deliver better-than-expected results. The demand for Nvidia's graphics cards has been exceeding supply, and its share of the market for AI graphics processing units (GPUs) is so strong that analysts are expecting its outstanding growth to continue beyond the current fiscal year.\n\nMore importantly, a solid set of results from Nvidia will give the AI ecosystem a nice lift, as its GPUs are the critical building blocks for companies looking to build and deploy AI applications. This article takes a closer look at two names that are key players in the AI market and likely to benefit from Nvidia's impressive results because of their ties to the company.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, with a market share of nearly 62%. As Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, it utilizes TSMC's production facilities to manufacture its chips. So, the healthy demand for Nvidia's AI chips also translates into more orders for TSMC, leading to impressive growth in the latter's revenue and earnings.\n\nIt is worth noting that TSMC has been witnessing an acceleration in its growth this year, thanks to clients such as Nvidia. TSM Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nTSMC reported year-over-year revenue growth of 13% in the first quarter of 2024 to $18.9 billion. This was followed by stronger growth in Q2 when its top line jumped 33% from the year-ago period to $20.8 billion. The foundry giant has guided for $22.8 billion in revenue for Q3, which would be an increase of 34% from the same period last year.\n\nHowever, TSMC's revenue for July increased an impressive 45% year over year, suggesting that it is on track to grow at an even faster pace in the current quarter. Also, solid results from Nvidia are likely to lift the confidence of TSMC investors. That's because Nvidia's AI chips are manufactured using TSMC's advanced process nodes.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia's highly popular H100 AI graphics card is built using TSMC's 5-nanometer process node. What's more, Nvidia is reportedly one of the companies that have completely booked out TSMC's 3nm chips for the next couple of years. Not surprisingly, TSMC is focused on expanding its production capacity to meet the strong demand from customers, such as Nvidia, and recently approved a $30 billion expansion plan to construct new fabrication facilities and upgrade existing ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this explains why better-than-expected results from Nvidia are likely to rub off positively on TSMC stock, which is why investors should consider buying it while it is trading at just 27 times forward earnings, a discount to the U.S. technology sector's average of 44.\n\n2. Micron Technology\n\nNvidia's AI GPUs are equipped with a special type of memory known as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) to accelerate AI workloads, and Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is one of the companies supplying the graphics card specialist with this chip. On its June earnings conference call, Micron management said the company expects to generate \"several hundred million dollars\" in HBM revenue in the current fiscal year 2024, which will end this month, followed by \"multiple billions of dollars in revenue from HBM in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that Micron has sold out its HBM capacity for 2024 and 2025. However, the company is looking to win a bigger share of this market by expanding its customer base and developing HBM chips that could deliver more power and efficiency. That's a smart thing to do, considering that the HBM market is forecast to generate $14 billion in revenue this year and $20 billion in revenue in 2025, up from just $5.5 billion last year.\n\nThis outstanding growth in the HBM market is directly proportional to the growing AI chip demand, as the likes of Nvidia and AMD have been looking to pack their offerings with more of this memory. The good part is that the AI-fueled surge in the memory market is driving a turnaround in Micron's fortunes, leading to a recovery in its margins and helping the company return to revenue growth. MU Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAnalysts are expecting Micron's revenue to increase by 61% in fiscal 2024 to $25 billion, followed by a 54% increase in fiscal 2025 to $38.6 billion. Meanwhile, it is expected to post a profit in the current fiscal year as compared to a loss of $4.45 per share in fiscal 2023. MU EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, the stock's performance has been volatile lately, and it lost 25% of its value in the past couple of months. With the stock currently trading at an incredibly attractive 12 times forward earnings, investors can consider buying it before Aug. 28, as Nvidia's results are likely to give the memory specialist a shot in the arm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): ‘I Like The Saga So Much; It Makes Me Happy.’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500’s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I’m telling you, it’s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\n\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance—with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%—the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn’t as favorable. We’re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\n\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\n\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\n\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 216\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s IPO, Jim Cramer reflected on the company's remarkable journey. Cramer had estimated Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s value at around $300 on its first day, a figure so high that it prompted questions from his lawyer. In hindsight, he admitted that $500 would have been a more accurate estimate, though he was being conservative.\n\n\"On this the 20th anniversary of the IPO, I want you to consider the saga of Google. I like the saga so much; it makes me happy. When it went public, it used a Dutch auction system which favored buyers over sellers. You got a driven price if you managed to snag a piece of it. I remember mentioning on air that I thought Google was worth about $300 that day, a price so high that our lawyer called me to ask how I came up with that number. I said I would have used $500 but was being conservative.\"\n\nSince its IPO, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has continually reinvented itself, growing its cloud business significantly under Thomas Kurian, who took over in 2019. Cramer praised Kurian’s achievements, noting that Google Cloud is now on a $42 billion run rate. He also highlighted recent executive changes, including the appointment of a new CFO, which he views positively. Cramer noted that while Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a tremendous performer—delivering a 7,736% return since its IPO—investors often struggle with short-term market fluctuations.\n\nHe compared this situation to recent market movements, such as\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)’s strong performance despite broader market concerns. Cramer emphasized that individual stocks, rather than indices like the S&P 500, are the real drivers of wealth creation. He also advised maintaining positions in top-performing companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), despite short-term market volatility.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Lam Research and Elevance. Alphabet shares rose by 21% during the quarter, making it the largest contributor to our performance. The company reported excellent Q1 earnings, highlighting accelerating revenue growth, strong profitability and effective capital allocation. Alphabet’s core search business is growing at a mid-teens rate—the fastest growth rate in nearly two years. Importantly, its non-search businesses have reached significant scale, with its cloud and YouTube businesses expected to reach a combined run-rate of $100 billion by the end of 2024\n\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet also displayed meaningful progress in its AI initiatives, and we believe it is well positioned to be a leader in this field. The capital allocation is solid. It is returning all the free cash flow to shareholders and announced that it will start paying a dividend. Alphabet’s shares are trading at just over 20X next year’s earnings, which is a very reasonable valuation for a business with such high-quality characteristics and growth potential.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top bullish stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Aug. 28 Could Be a Massive Day for Nvidia Stock. Is It a Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on the market, and for good reason. It has put up incredible growth numbers quarter after quarter lately, and each time, the stock has popped following those reports. With Nvidia's second-quarter FY 2025 results being announced on Aug. 28 after the markets close, investors may want to consider buying Nvidia stock before that date.\n\nHowever, these results may differ from some of its previous announcements, as year-over-year comparisons are becoming more difficult. NVDA Chart\n\nThe growth won't be as strong as in previous quarters\n\nNvidia's rise is tied to its primary product: graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs were developed by Nvidia back in the '90s as devices that could process gaming graphics more efficiently than a CPU. While GPUs excelled in this field, other uses were quickly developed for them.\n\nBecause a GPU can process multiple calculations in parallel, it is useful for calculation-intensive tasks like engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training. The latter has caused its business to explode, and we'll get a checkup on demand next week when the company releases its most recent quarterly results.\n\nFor Q2, management told investors to expect $28 billion in revenue. Compared to last year's Q2 sales of $13.5 billion, that represents 107% year over year growth. That would be an impressive jump, but would represent a growth rate slowdown compared to previous quarters. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nThis slowdown is occurring because we are overlapping the period when AI demand really started to take off. Still, I wouldn't consider a doubling of revenue a disappointment. Additionally, don't be surprised if Nvidia beats that target. It has consistently outperformed its guidance over the past year, and Wall Street analysts are starting to catch on to this trend. From an average of 40 analysts, they collectively think Nviida's Q2 revenue will be $28.5 billion.\n\nWhile year-over-year revenue growth is an important stat, there are others that I think are more important to consider, with margin at the top of that list.\n\nNvidia's margin will be important to examine\n\nNvidia's revenue growth has been nothing short of incredible, but its margin expansion has been even more impressive. With a gross margin near 80% and a profit margin approaching 60%, Nvidia has become one of the most profitable companies ever to trade on the public markets. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhen the Q2 report comes out, I'll be looking to see if the company has maintained or expanded these elevated levels. If investors see weakness in these margins, it's a sign that Nvidia is facing increased competition and needed to adjust the price of its GPUs to stay competitive in the market.\n\nI don't expect a margin drop, but if one does occur, don't be surprised if the stock gets slammed immediately after the release of information.\n\nIs the stock a buy now?\n\nWith Nvidia expected to report another strong quarter, many investors may wonder if they should invest now, before the report. Investors should first consider that investing success hardly ever comes from trying to time the market and jump in and out at just the right time.\n\nThey should also consider how expensive the stock is, trading at nearly 46 times forward earnings estimates. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThe stock has a lot of growth baked into it, and Nvidia will need to report a strong Q2 and give impressive Q3 guidance to justify the optimism.\n\nFor many investors (including myself), the price is too high. But for others, it may still represent a buying opportunity. At this valuation, Nvidia needs to report another year or two of flawless quarters; otherwise, it could be knocked from its perch. If you believe it can do that, Nvidia's stock could still be interesting here. But with its history of reporting strong earnings, and being rewarded by investors for doing so, if you're ready to be a buyer, you might want to buy before Aug. 28.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Aug. 28?",
        "content": "It's been yet another exciting earnings season for investors as megacap tech companies proved that the artificial intelligence (AI) train is moving full steam ahead.\n\nOne AI player in particular is yet to publish financial results for the second quarter. On Aug. 28, semiconductor specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will report earnings, and you can bet that bulls and bears all across Wall Street will be focusing on every last number the company produces.\n\nLet's dive into what investors should look for and assess if now is a good time to buy shares of Nvidia.\n\nWhat is Wall Street forecasting for Nvidia earnings?\n\nNvidia reports revenue in five categories: data centers, gaming, professional visualization, automotive, and original equipment manufacturing (OEM).\n\nEach segment is connected to AI in some form or fashion, but the overwhelming majority of Nvidia's business stems from data centers. During the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), total revenue was $26 billion. Nearly 87% of that, or $22.7 billion, came from the data center business.\n\nAccording to consensus analyst estimates, Wall Street is forecasting that second-quarter sales will be around $28.5 billion. Should Nvidia achieve this target, it would represent 111% growth year over year.\n\nIn the section below, I'll break down why I think Nvidia might blow away these estimates and explain some of that tailwinds that could be lifting its important data center operation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA good proxy for Nvidia\n\nIt's obvious that a common thread stitching the overall fabric of megacap tech right now is AI. But at a more granular level, AI's integration with cloud computing is a big movement within the technology industry at large.\n\nThe cloud computing landscape is dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet.\n\nDuring the second quarter, each of these \"Magnificent Seven\" members revealed some interesting features. Namely, each is aggressively increasing investments in capital expenditures (capex). AMZN Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the company's big initiative is an $11 billion investment into data centers in Indiana as part of a broader rollout to develop its own AI-powered chips. As for Microsoft, the company hasn't been shy about new investments in nuclear-powered data centers as the company seeks to double down on AI infrastructure in an energy efficient way.\n\nDuring Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said that capex spending was \"driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDo you see the theme? All of Nvidia's cohorts are investing tens of billions of dollars into data center infrastructure, and the trends in the chart above suggest it won't be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nConsidering the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits comes from data center services and the company's sophisticated graphics processing units (GPU), I see the rising capex patterns from others in big tech as a good proxy for what's to come for Nvidia.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock before Aug. 28?\n\nAI emerged as the hottest ticket in the tech realm toward the end of 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how Nvidia stock reacted following a series of earnings reports since the beginning of last year. The earnings report dates are annotated by the purple circles with \"E\" in the middle. NVDA Chart\n\nIt's clear that Nvidia stock has risen considerably over the last 20 months or so. More specifically, the stock rarely dropped immediately following an earnings report, and when it did, the sell-off was brief.\n\nTo me, this helps validate that buying Nvidia stock either before or after its last several earnings reports ended in the same result: gains. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nWhen it comes to valuation, Nvidia stock is less expensive today than it was a year ago on both a price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) basis. This compression in multiples has occurred because the company's profits and cash flow are actually rising faster than its sales, a sign of an incredibly healthy and powerful operation.\n\nGiven the trends from its Magnificent Seven peers noted above, I'm cautiously optimistic that Nvidia could experience yet another impressive quarter. For these reasons, it might be a good idea to buy some shares now because history suggests Nvidia stock could be headed for further gains.\n\nBut I wouldn't get too caught up in the exact timing. If you prefer to analyze the earnings report first and then decide to buy the stock, perhaps you'll be investing at a slightly higher valuation. Given the trends in the earnings chart, I'm confident that gains will still be on the horizon for long-term investors whether or not they buy Nvidia stock before Aug. 28.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recommends These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks recommended by Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed how global markets have become more interconnected than ever. He compared this to 1987, when Japan's influence on U.S. stocks was clear, with Japanese investors driving up prices in sectors like waste management and railroads. This connection between markets was strong then, and it's even stronger now.\n\n\"Obviously, we went down on Japan, and we went up on Japan. This is somewhat reminiscent of 1987, when, if Japan was up, they’d come over and flood our markets. Sometimes they didn’t care; they’d just start buying stocks, often starting with waste management and Browning-Ferris. \"\n\nCramer explained that the weakening dollar further enhances this global link, benefiting companies that sell internationally, such as Coca-Cola. He also observed a significant shift in investor behavior—where people once looked for reasons to stay out of the market, they now seem more inclined to stay in, finding optimism even in bad news. This change in attitude mirrors today's market environment, where good news lifts stocks, and even bad news is met with hope for a recovery.\n\n\"Back in the day, you’d wonder why Browning-Ferris was up, and the answer would be, 'Large buyer, large buyer, large buyer.' Eventually, you’d go out for a beer, and it turns out it’s Tokyo. They loved the rails. There was such craziness back then, but now, we’re even more linked. And with the dollar continuing to weaken, it’s good that we’re linked for companies like that.\"\n\nJim Cramer noted the irony of discussing September as a traditionally bad month for the market. He pointed out that when people focus too much on a specific month being negative, it often doesn’t turn out that way. Cramer also mentioned that despite this expectation, the market had been up significantly, making last week’s market behavior seem unusual.\n\n\"Well, it’s funny. You talked about September being a bad month last week, so maybe we get there in a roundabout way. I know that when you single out a month, that’s often when it doesn’t happen. But I also know that we’re up big, and last week seemed odd.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Squawk on the Street and his post on the key things to watch in the stock market for Monday. We selected ten stocks that he mentioned and included information on hedge fund sentiment for each. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge funds that own them, from lowest to highest.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 108\n\nJim Cramer notes that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is acquiring server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock. This deal will boost Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s capabilities in server-scale solutions, which are vital for AI computing, helping it compete better against NVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA). (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\n\"Advanced Micro Devices announced a $4.9 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of server maker ZT Systems. The deal should help the chipmaker in its battle with fellow Club holding Nvidia because server-scale solutions are increasingly important in the age of AI computing.\"\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is set for significant growth due to its strong range of products, including Ryzen CPUs, Radeon GPUs, and EPYC server processors. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has gained substantial market share in both consumer and enterprise sectors by delivering competitive performance, energy efficiency, and innovative technology. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s EPYC processors are particularly notable for making strides in the data center and server markets, challenging Intel’s long-time dominance and winning major clients like Google and Microsoft.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s focus on next-generation technologies, such as its Zen microarchitecture and RDNA graphics architecture, keeps it at the cutting edge. With the semiconductor industry booming due to increased demand for high-performance computing, gaming, and artificial intelligence, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s advanced products and technological leadership further boost its growth potential.\n\nOverall AMD ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) investors have been on a wild ride this year. The artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker soared as much as 174% in 2024, as excitement about the rapid adoption of generative AI has captivated Wall Street and Main Street alike. With those gains, however, has come extreme volatility, as the value of this emerging opportunity remains uncertain.\n\nIn recent weeks, the stock reversed course, plunging as much as 25%. Fears about the state of the economy have called into question the staying power of AI and how much further Nvidia can grow from here. The stock has regained much of those losses, but the questions remain.\n\nOne analyst believes Wall Street is setting its sights too low. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHSBC says Nvidia is a buy\n\nHSBC analyst Frank Lee recently reiterated his buy rating on Nvidia stock and increased his price target to $145. That represents potential upside for investors of 14% compared to Tuesday's closing price. The analyst believes that Nvidia will report $30 billion in sales for its fiscal second quarter, generating revenue of $33 billion and $36 billion in the quarters that follow.\n\nThe analyst notes that spending to upgrade data centers is on track to continue into 2025, driven by strong demand for generative AI.\n\nThe analyst has obviously done his homework. The three biggest cloud infrastructure providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which are Nvidia's biggest customers, have all been crystal clear about plans to increase their capital expenditure spending to meet the accelerating demand for AI. As the gold standard for AI processing, Nvidia is likely to be the beneficiary of much of that spending.\n\nFurthermore, the company's biggest partners and rivals are reporting strong sales, which suggests Nvidia's results will be equally robust.\n\nIf the analyst's calculations are correct, Nvidia's revenue will top $125 billion in fiscal 2025, more than double the $61 billion it earned last year -- and marking its second consecutive year of triple-digit growth.\n\nThat's why Nvidia stock is a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 28, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +133.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $28.24 billion, up 109% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?\n\nFor Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.25%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.61, delivering a surprise of +10.91%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nNvidia doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "As Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s highly anticipated earnings report approaches, Northland Capital Markets has offered insights into the semiconductor landscape, particularly in relation to the AI trade.\n\nWhile the firm remains cautious about the broader semiconductor sector due to potential volatility stemming from Nvidia's guidance, they have identified six stocks that could present buying opportunities.\n\nNorthland Capital Markets believes Nvidia will likely surpass consensus expectations, driven by robust demand for its products.\n\nHowever, the firm's analysts express concern that the company's guidance might not be strong enough to sustain its momentum.\n\n\"NVDA's breakout quarter was a year ago, with revenues increasing by 88%,\" they wrote. \"Y/Y comps are becoming increasingly difficult moving forward.\"\n\nThis caution stems from Nvidia's ongoing product transition and rising competition in the AI space, which could impact its future performance.\n\nDespite these concerns, Northland recommends looking for opportunities to buy certain semiconductor stocks that could benefit regardless of Nvidia's short-term outlook. Specifically, they highlight AMBA, AIP, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), CEVA, PWR, and PDFS as attractive picks heading into Nvidia's earnings report.\n\nThese companies are seen to be poised to benefit from various trends in the semiconductor and AI markets.\n\nThe report also underscores the competitive dynamics in the AI sector, particularly between Nvidia and AMD.\n\n\"AMD and NVDA are on different commercialization paths,\" Northland notes, drawing a parallel to the historical rivalry between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They expect Nvidia's market share in AI infrastructure to erode over time as alternatives gain traction.\n\nWhile Nvidia's earnings could introduce volatility, Northland Capital Markets sees potential in these six semiconductor stocks, making them attractive buys ahead of the report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy these six semis stocks going into Nvidia earnings\n\nWill Buffett's 'put' on oil firm Occidental halt share drop?\n\nTJ Maxx parent raises annual profit forecast after strong second quarter\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer: Many NVIDIA (NVDA) Shareholders Know ‘Little About The Company’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a new program discussed the latest market selloff again, saying the notion the broader meltdown was because of “hard landing” fears is “totally false.” Cramer said that it was all related to the Japanese stock market and Yen, and “nothing more.”\n\n“A bunch of money managers took advantage of how you can borrow against Japanese bonds which had a very low interest rate and then have relatively free money which you can put to work in stocks all around the globe, including here (the US),” Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said that small-cap stocks are “trying to come” back. However, he pointed to an “issue” with the small-cap rally. He said that no one actually bought individual small-cap stocks and instead loaded up on ETFs. Investors, according to Cramer, “walked away” when the broader market wavered.\n\nFor this article we watched the latest programs on Cramer recently aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program said that one of the key reasons behind the declines in Nvidia shares were reports saying Blackwell would be late. Cramer was furious on these reports saying he has not been able to verify the accuracy of these.\n\nCramer said that NVDA stock rebounded after a report from UBS saying the news about Blackwell delays was unfounded. However, Cramer said he believes the stock can get hit again and “many of its holders know little about the company.”\n\nCramer said even if Blackwell sees delays Nvidia can make up for the shortfalls with H200 chips.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stocks to Buy During the Nasdaq Sell-Off",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have been a winning theme in the artificial intelligence (AI) stock rally. High-flying chip companies Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) performed so well that management split their stocks to make it easier for investors and company employees to buy or sell shares.\n\nRemember that stock splits lower the share price but offset that by increasing the number of shares. In other words, stock splits don't fundamentally change a stock's valuation. However, a sell-off, like what investors saw recently in the Nasdaq, can.\n\nEven though the market has bounced back, these two (AI) winners remain below their highs. If the Nasdaq continues to sell off, both stocks would be excellent buys for long-term investors. Here is why.\n\nA sell-off creates a much-needed margin of safety for Nvidia stock\n\nNo company has enjoyed more AI-driven success than Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the primary choice for data centers running complex AI models. Its proprietary CUDA software helps customers unlock the full power of its GPU chips, making them perfect for AI.\n\nThe tech industry's power players are in an arms race to build the computing resources needed to support AI growth. That strong demand launched Nvidia's revenue to new heights starting in 2023.\n\nThe AI and cloud heavyweights intend to keep spending. Microsoft said in its latest earnings call that AI demand outstripped its available computing resources. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said in a \"fireside chat\" with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that his company has accumulated nearly 600,000 of the latter's H100 chips and will invest more next year to support AI.\n\nThe CEO of Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices believes the broader AI chip market will grow to $400 billion over the next several years. Nvidia, the market leader, only sells a fraction of that today. The signs point to sustained demand, and the company wants to protect its market share by frequently releasing cutting-edge chips to keep pace with innovation.\n\nRevenue probably won't continue growing by triple digits, but analysts believe Nvidia will grow earnings by 36% annually over the long term. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAssuming Nvidia delivers on estimates, the stock looks like a bargain today at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, which is attractive for such a fast-growing business. But the company will face competition from other chipmakers and big-tech customers that could try to build their own chips.\n\nSo, while the stock could look cheap in hindsight if things go well, investors should welcome any sell-off that will build a margin of safety to account for the unknowns.\n\nStory continues\n\nA shaky market makes Broadcom a buy-the-dip opportunity\n\nBroadcom has been an excellent stock for AI investors looking for diversification. It specializes in semiconductors for networking and communications and has another business unit that provides infrastructure software to enterprises. Total revenue is split roughly 2-to-1 between its semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software.\n\nSemiconductor stocks are cyclical. AI has created a boom in chip spending, but that will likely slow at some point as AI capacity catches up to demand. Broadcom isn't growing as fast as Nvidia is, but the software business generates recurring revenue that could make the company less volatile over the long term.\n\nThat said, Broadcom is getting a big push from AI; just like how AI models require powerful processing chips, they also create heavy networking loads that need similarly AI-specialized hardware. The company initially guided that AI would contribute 25% of its semiconductor solutions revenue in 2024 but increased that to 35% in the second quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, adding VMware to the software business helped Broadcom's total revenue grow 43% year over year in the second quarter. Organic revenue growth (excluding the acquisition) was still 12%. That isn't explosive, but analysts believe the company will grow earnings by 18% annually over the long term, and that's nothing to sneeze at. AVGO Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nBroadcom doubles as an excellent dividend stock, separating it from most AI investments. The starting yield isn't huge, just 1.3%, but management has raised its payout by an average of 19% annually over the past five years.\n\nThe stock offers investors a bit of everything: AI upside, dividends, and a diversified business that might hold up better during a sell-off.

        "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Opportunity Fund” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund rose 4.35% (Institutional Shares), lagged the Russell 3000 Growth Index, which gained 7.80%, and essentially matched the S&P 500 Index, which advanced 4.28%. In the first half of 2024, the fund posted solid gains, rising 20.44% compared to a 19.90% return for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and beating the S&P 500 Index’s 15.29% gain. After a slow start to the quarter, U.S. stocks increased steadily in May and June. Increased worries about inflation, the pace of expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were blamed for the early market weakness.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 11.38%, and its shares gained 170.08% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 20, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $127.25 per share with a market capitalization of $3.13 trillion.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) sells semiconductors, systems, and software for accelerated computing, gaming, and generative AI. NVIDIA’s stock continued its run, rising 36.9% in the second quarter and finishing the first half of 2024 up 149.9%. NVIDIA continued to report unprecedented growth at scale, with quarterly revenues of $26 billion growing 262% year-over- year, datacenter segment revenues of $22.6 billion up 427% year-on-year, and operating margins of 69.3%. NVIDIA’s growth is even more impressive as it is nearing a new product cycle with Blackwell going into production in the third quarter, which speaks to the urgency of demand for GPUs as customers are not willing to wait for the next generation architecture despite its improved performance-to-cost ratio. The Blackwell architecture, and in particular, the new GB200 NVL72/36 racks, which the company believes would become “the new unit of compute,” would in our view:\n\n(1) increase the company’s content per server (for example an NVL72 rack would have 18 compute trays with 4 Blackwell GPUs and 2 Grace CPU in each, and 9 switch trays with NVIDIA content); and (2) further strengthen its competitive advantages as the demand for datacenter-scale computing grows due to scaling laws (models become more capable with size and as they are trained on more data), new model types (such as Mixture of Experts that increase the demand on sharing of data between GPUs) and model optimization mechanisms (such as tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and expert parallelism – which also increase the demands from the connectivity layer), and increase the relative importance of NVIDIA’s networking and full-system capabilities (in particular the capabilities enabled with the latest generation of NVLink–connecting up to 576 GPUs together, up from 8)…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "Nvidia eyes return to record as AI spending bonanza continues",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With questions swirling around Federal Reserve policy, the state of the economy and the US presidential race, at least one thing seems clear on Wall Street: spending on artificial intelligence remains a central priority.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Serious Work That Free Play Can Do ‘Train Lovers’ Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid Part of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks Climate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\n\nCompanies are pouring tens of billions of dollars into building out AI infrastructure and services, making the beneficiaries — notably Nvidia Corp. — close to a sure thing in terms of their growth prospects. The chipmaker’s results next week will provide further clarity on AI demand, and could vault the shares back into record territory.\n\n“We’re nowhere near close to finishing the build out of AI infrastructure, and that gives you a very good line of sight in terms of the growth you can expect over the coming years,” said Erik Swords, lead portfolio manager at Voya Investment Management.\n\nRather than being in the late innings of this theme, “we’ve barely walked out of the dugout,” Swords said. “So while we’ll see volatility over the short term, I don’t have any concerns about where these AI hardware stocks are trading over the medium or long term.”\n\nInvestors have scrutinized spending levels more closely this earnings season, in some cases punishing stocks for favoring capex over more shareholder friendly policies. Concerns about the returns from AI investments recently contributed to a tech selloff, although that dip was readily bought amid signs that economic growth remains resilient and rising confidence that the spending on AI itself will stay strong.\n\nAI hardware and chip companies have led the bounce in the Nasdaq 100 from its August low, with Nvidia the index’s top performer, up almost 30% and just 6.1% short of the all-time high. Peers Micron Technology Inc., Marvell Technology Inc., Super Micro Computer Inc., Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and ARM Holdings Plc have all starred in the rebound.\n\nNvidia’s results follow a few weeks after reports from a group of megacaps — including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., which together account for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue — underscored their commitment to spending on AI. Strong monthly sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. similarly pointed to robust AI demand.\n\nCEOs at tech giants, including Alphabet and Meta, have said they would rather overspend on AI than risk under-investing in the technology. Such comments, given these players’ deep pockets, suggest AI spending will remain durable even if the economic backdrop weakens.\n\nStory continues\n\n“For all intents and purposes, companies this big don’t have limits on their resources, and they can spend for years on AI if they feel like missing out puts their dominance at risk,” said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.\n\nThe build out of AI infrastructure is expected to be both enormous and long lasting. According to Needham, which cited a conversation it had with the CEO of a generative AI infrastructure company, investment in data center infrastructure needed to support GenAI could reach $6 trillion.\n\nEven so, there’s evidence this trend isn’t fully appreciated by the market. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, estimates that capex from big tech could potentially increase by as much as 25% in 2025, well above the consensus expectation for 10-15% growth. This “is especially positive for AI enablers in the semiconductors field,” she wrote.\n\nSpending on AI has yet to translate to dramatically improved growth and efficiency for Nvidia’s biggest customers. However, analysts are confident that the current pace of outlays is sustainable. Morgan Stanley wrote that average capex intensity — a measure of capex relative to revenue — is roughly 25%, which it called “a healthy level.” Furthermore, the ratio of capex to Ebitda “shows sufficient cash flow for spending.”\n\nNvidia’s results “will dispel concern and drive share price rebounds for the overall AI supply chain,” analyst Charlie Chan wrote.\n\nTo be sure, some are yet to be convinced that spending on AI will be enough to continue lifting AI hardware stocks, given they trade at multiples that provide little room for disappointment. Some companies in the group, including Super Micro and Dell Technologies Inc., have struggled to regain their momentum of earlier this year, even with recent strength.\n\n“Nvidia’s valuation can be justified if you can underwrite the sustainability of the earnings stream, but risks seem greater because the companies doing the spending can be rewarded if they stop, while there would only be downside for hardware,” said Allspring’s VanCronkhite. “We’re not at the point where investors are ready to dump stocks, but they’re starting to ask questions about the ROI from AI, and that’s the first step before actions get more dramatic.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNetflix Inc. shares gained 1.5% on Tuesday, with the streaming-video company closing at a record for the first time in nearly three years. The stock is now up more than 40% this year, easily outperforming other streaming stocks as its strategy to improve profitability plays out.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMicrochip Technology Inc. said Tuesday that its servers were hit by a cyberattack that has forced the US chipmaker to shut some of its systems and scale back operations. Walmart Inc. raised about $3.6 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc., winding down an eight-year partnership that appears to be paying diminishing returns amid a challenging landscape for Chinese tech giants. The rapid rise in Ola Electric Mobility Ltd. shares is vindicating the founder’s push to list the company despite initial skepticism over valuation. Condé Nast has penned a multiyear agreement with OpenAI to license the magazine company’s content, the latest high-profile media deal for the artificial intelligence startup.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nAnalog Devices GDS Holdings Postmarket\n\nSynopsys Snowflake Zoom Video Wolfspeed Inc Zuora Zepp Health\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik and Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport Where All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes US Integrity Catches Pro Athletes Involved in Betting Schemes Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Politics seen as the key catalyst for higher volatility within this bull trend",
        "content": "Politics is among key catalysts driving higher volatility within the current bull trend, Evercore ISI analysts noted Tuesday.\n\nThe report suggests that the volatility spikes seen in 2024, such as the \"Supervol Spike\" on August 5, which sent the VIX Index to its fourth-highest level ever, are not isolated incidents but are closely tied to political developments and uncertainties.\n\nThe spike was averted by a narrative that the Federal Reserve is prepared to do “whatever it takes.” According to Evercore, this narrative will be implied by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at the upcoming Jackson Hole conference, “seeking to pilot the economy to a ‘Soft Landing’.”\n\nIn addition, the upcoming events such as Vice President Harris's speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), at least one presidential debate, and the approaching U.S. election on November 5 could also inject volatility into the markets.\n\nAnalysts question whether Harris’s speech at the DNC will be a “rally killer” such as Trump’s acceptance at the Republican National Convention (RNC) last month, or an “upside blowoff catalyst if there is a centrist message [in] her words?”\n\nNonetheless, Evercore points out that it isn’t just politics that is fueling volatility within the ongoing bull run.\n\nThe annual BLS Payrolls benchmark revision on Wednesday, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings on Aug. 28, the two FOMC meetings in September and November, as well as numerous growth and inflation report releases might all make an impact.\n\nU.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Tuesday, halting their recent winning streak as investors awaited the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, which begins on Thursday. The three major U.S. indexes dipped, concluding a multi-session rally that saw the equities market recover from a sharp downturn fueled by recession concerns.\n\nEvercore analysts believe the path for the S&P 500 to reach 6,000 remains “intact but prone to further volatility surges, befitting prior election years where Congressional control is as “tight” as 2024.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPolitics seen as the key catalyst for higher volatility within this bull trend\n\nEarnings call: Kingsoft Cloud reports growth and AI sector progress\n\nTarget stock surges as Q2 results top expectations, guidance raised\n\nView comments",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Star Group, L.P. SGU and Aware, Inc. AWRE.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Apple, NVIDIA and Coca-Cola\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and The Coca-Cola Co., as well as two micro-cap stocks Star Group, L.P. and Aware, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nApple shares have lagged the the Zacks Tech sector past year ( +28.8% vs. +38.6%), but performed roughly in-line with the broader market (+28.8% vs. +27.5% for the S&P 500 index). Weighing on the stock's muted momentum is the macro overhang from China whose economic outlook continues to remain uncertain. The company reported a decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues.\n\nApple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis.\n\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+160.7% vs. +114.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\n\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. +11.3%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In second-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, with both metrics showing year-over-year improvement.\n\nStrong revenue growth across most operating segments, supported by improved price/mix and unit volume growth aided results. KO is well-poised to benefit from innovations and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024.\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\n\nShares of Star have gained +6.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry’s gain of +11.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $409.70 million witnessed strong revenue growth, driven by a 25.3% increase in heating oil and propane volumes, and improved margins despite warmer weather.\n\nStrategic acquisitions are bolstering market position, adding significant volume and operational synergies. The company has enhanced profitability by reducing its adjusted EBITDA loss by $18.9 million and maintaining strong cost control, leading to improved margins. Star Group's leadership in home heating, diversification into related services and a robust balance sheet with solid cash flow management further strengthen its investment case.\n\nHowever, challenges include declining heating oil volumes, weather sensitivity, customer attrition and rising operating expenses. Additionally, the company faces competitive pressures from alternative energy sources, which could impact market share and profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Star here >>>)\n\nAware’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry over the year-to-date period (+48.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $53.17 million witnessed 17% revenue growth in the first half of 2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and a 14% rise in recurring revenue, reflects a shift toward a subscription model and underscores its market expansion and improved financial predictability.\n\nStrategic cost management reduced operating expenses by 7%, narrowing net losses and enhancing adjusted EBITDA. The shift to a recurring revenue model, with a 31% second-quarter 2024 revenue uptick, and securing large contracts, including a $1.2 million automated biometric identification system (ABIS) deal, highlight Aware's growing global footprint.\n\nYet, declining cash reserves, continued net losses, reliance on government contracts and limited market diversification pose significant risks. Increasing competition and execution risks in strategic initiatives could pressure revenue growth and profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Aware here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer, Dell, Bank of America and Advanced Micro Devices",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 21, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, Bank of America Corporation BAC and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nThe Better AI Stock to Buy Now: NVDA or SMCI\n\nTwo of the most sought-after artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on Wall Street are NVIDIA Corp. and Super Micro Computer, Inc. These top-notch stocks took advantage of the booming AI-empowered hardware market for quite some time, with NVIDIA and Super Micro shares surging 161.5% and 119.4%, respectively, so far this year. In 2023, the stocks rallied more than 200% each.\n\nNotably, the AI-enabled hardware market is well-positioned to surpass $84.9 billion by 2031, at a CAGR of 15.5% from 2024 to 2031, per Skyquest. NVIDIA, in particular, is making the most of the ever-expanding AI-driven chip market, which is poised to be $383.7 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 38.2% from 2023 to 2032, according to Allied Market Research.\n\nNVIDIA controls the bulk of the AI chip market, which has given the tech behemoth an imposing pricing power. Such dominance has helped NVIDIA post a stunning performance in the fiscal first quarter. Revenues soared a remarkable 262% year over year in the quarter to $26 billion. Earnings per share skyrocketed 461% to $6.12 a share.\n\nNVIDIA is likely to do even better due to the evolving growth avenues in the blossoming AI market. Countries such as Singapore, Japan, France and Italy are investing profoundly in AI infrastructure, which in due course should boost NVIDIA’s top line. Additionally, some prominent companies in India, such as Reliance Industries and Tata Group, are banking on NVIDIA’s chips to train large language models.\n\nWhat’s more, outlays on AI chips are expected to jump tenfold in the coming years, a blessing in disguise for NVIDIA. Having said that, Super Micro’s business is entangled with chipmakers like NVIDIA, which should certainly boost its share price. After all, Super Micro is one of the major producers of steadfast AI servers needed to mount AI chips that chipmakers sell.\n\nSo, in a way, NVIDIA and Super Micro complement each other, and they aren’t competitors. Nonetheless, Super Micro recently concluded its fiscal 2024 and achieved $14.94 billion in sales, up an astounding 110% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro is expected to maintain this stellar performance due to healthy demand for AI servers in the next couple of fiscal years. The AI server market is estimated to register a CAGR of more than 18% from 2024 to 2032, added Global Market Insights.\n\nIn reality, for quite some time, Super Micro has been growing at a much faster pace than more established players in the server market, like Dell Technologies Inc. So, the obvious question is, does it make any sense to buy Super Micro over NVIDIA?\n\nSMCI Has More Room to Run\n\nBoth NVIDIA and Super Micro are poised to grow, but Super Micro has more room to grow since it only accounts for nearly 10% of the dedicated AI server market. Consequently, Bank of America Corporation expects Super Micro’s share in the AI server market to increase to 17% in the next three-year period.\n\nSuper Micro, no doubt, has a long-term partnership with NVIDIA. But now, it’s also making dedicated AI servers for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and this divergence should certainly provide Super Micro more room to scale upward.\n\nSMCI Less Pricey Than NVDA\n\nSuper Micro’s shares are less expensive than NVIDIA, which has given the AI server maker an edge over the AI chip maker. After all, buying Super Micro’s shares will burn a smaller hole in your pocket compared to the NVIDIA stock.\n\nThis is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, Super Micro stock currently trades at 18.6X forward earnings. However, the NVIDIA’s forward earnings multiple is 48.3X.\n\nSMCI – A Solid Buy, Very Strong ROE\n\nSuper Micro, rightfully, is a better buy than NVIDIA due to more growth potential and lower valuation. SMCI has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nNotable brokerage companies have also jacked up the average short-term price target of SMCI by 45.7% from the server solution provider’s last closing price of $628.80. The analysts’ highest price target is at $1,500.\n\nTo top it off, Super Micro has generated profits competently since SMCI has a return on equity (ROE) of 30.6%. Any ROE of more than 20% is generally considered very strong.\n\nSeparately, NVIDIA, at the moment, has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Tech Stock to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Stacy Rasgon",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other tech stocks to monitor amid market volatility.\n\nIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\n\nIn a recent interview with IBD, Rasgon zeroed in on semi stocks, highlighting that they had been massively outperforming, mostly on AI. However, he cautioned investors about potential upside to these firms outside of AI, like in the PCs or smartphones business, noting that even though they might be better than last year, it was evident they would not be growing at a rapid pace anytime soon. He also added that outside of AI, data center, server CPU, and networking demand remained weak. Bernstein, the investment advisory where Rasgon practices his trade, recently revealed a basket of prominent stocks in the tech, media, and communications domain that had upside potential of almost 26% to price targets by the advisory.\n\nThis list comes amid worries over the state of the job market and consumer spending in the United States, as well as a potential artificial intelligence air pocket. Bernstein analysts have advised investors to put their money to work in this period of heightened market volatility. Several AI-related tech names are trading at huge discounts due to the selloff, with some of these names discussed in detail below. More information about these firms can be found by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected companies who operate in the tech domain and have been on the radar of Wall Street analysts. An important investor note by investment bank Bernstein formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon recently appeared on CNBC to highlight his bullish views on the AI revolution, naming NVIDIA as the top pick in the sector with lots of room to run even with recent worries about capex and ROI, simply because demand remained high. He noted that the company had enormous potential in the AI data center space. He added that the depth in enterprise AI adoption was encouraging, even though it was moving at a pace that was slower than expected. He underlined how large customers comprised more than 40% of the overall revenue of NVIDIA, even as it developed a larger customer base.\n\nInvestment advisory Bernstein has an Outperform rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock with a price target of $130. In a recent investor note, the advisory said it was not panicking yet as media reports suggested a three month delay to the Blackwell roadmap by NVIDIA. Analysts at the advisory suggested that at a minimum, despite recent worries over AI ROI, it remained clear that demand levels were continuing to rise and NVIDIA had other products to sell in the meantime to help backfill.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the tech stocks to monitor amid market volatility. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): An AI Stock You Should Not Miss",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\n\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\n\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\n\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% — the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 179\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The company is the most famous manufacturer of graphic processing units (GPUs), powerful chips that provide power for the computational complexity of AI tasks. Earlier this year, the firm revealed Blackwell, the latest GPU dubbed the most powerful chip in the world, surpassing the efficiency of the previous Hopper model. Prominent tech names like Google, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms were in line to snap up these chips off the production line for their AI data centers, but last-minute design flaws have forced NVIDIA to delay the launch of these chips by at least three months, raising concern just before the company releases earnings results for the third quarter.\n\nHowever, analysts on Wall Street have backed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to emerge from this hiccup without too much damage. For example, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis, who has a 79% success rate on NVIDIA calls, has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $150. He recently forecast that the firm would beat market expectations on earnings and guidance by $1 billion each. He also noted that the demand for the Hopper chips of NVIDIA remains robust, and inventories and continued production should help bridge the gap to ramping Blackwell.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "U.S. stocks registered the best week of the year for major indexes last week. The S&P 500 advanced 3.9% last week, the Dow Jones recorded 2.9% gains, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.9%. After a significant rally on Thursday, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite managed to recover from earlier losses in August.\n\nConsumer Sentiment and Data\n\nThe rally was mainly aided by two data: monthly retail sales and Walmart's (WMT) latest earnings report. These reports indicated that recession fears stemming from the stock market's early August drop might be overblown. Walmart's CFO indicated consistent consumer behavior throughout the second quarter, noting no major slump in July.\n\nRetail sales in the United States inched up 1% sequentially in July 2024, following a downwardly revised 0.2% drop in June and way better than forecasts of a 0.3% gain. It is the biggest increase since January 2023, with sales at motor vehicle and part dealers rising the most (3.6%), followed by sales at electronics and appliance stores (1.6%) (read: Retail Sales Gains in July: ETFs & Stocks to Play).\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed its lowest year-over-year increase since early 2021, allowing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to recover losses from earlier in the month (read: Momentum ETFs to Play as Wall Street Rallies?).\n\nFederal Reserve Rate Cuts\n\nIn light of the positive economic data, investor expectations regarding Fed rate cuts have moderated. Current data from the CME Group shows a 66% chance of a 0.25% rate cut by the Fed next month, with a 33% probability for a 0.50% cut. This goes against the previous market speculation for a larger rate reduction.\n\nTop-Performing ETFs\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nNvidia-Heavy ETF – Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2X Shares NVDU – Up 40.1%\n\nNvidia share price gained 17.2% due to a tech rebound rally. The Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2X Shares seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the performance of the common shares of NVIDIA Corporation. The expense ratio of NVDU is 1.04%.\n\nGold Miners – MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN GDXU – Up 24.0%\n\nThe underlying S-Network MicroSectors Gold Miners Index seeks to provide exposure to the performance of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF. The fund charges 95 bps in fees.\n\nLeveraged Technology – Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X Shares TECL – Up 23.8%\n\nThe underlying Technology Select Sector Index includes domestic companies from the following industries: computers & peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors & semiconductor equipment; internet software & services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments & components; wireless telecommunication services; & office electronics. The fund charges 94 bps in fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouth Korea –Direxion MSCI Daily South Korea Bull 3X Shares KORU – Up 16.1%\n\nThe underlying MSCI Korea 25-50 Index measures the performance of the large and mid-cap segments of the South Korea equity market, covering approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in South Korea. The fund’s expense ratio is 1.34% and the fund yields 2.77%.\n\nTesla-Heavy – GraniteShares 2x Long TSLA Daily ETF TSLR – Up 15.9%\n\nThe Tesla stock was up 8.7% last week. The GraniteShares 2x Long TSLA Daily ETF seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 2 times the daily percentage change of the common stock of Tesla Inc. The expense ratio of the ETF is 1.50%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock traded lower as investors resorted to profit booking. The stock gained 193% in the last 12 months, backed by the artificial intelligence frenzy.\n\nAnalysts, includingWedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson and Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, hailed Nvidia as the critical AI play.\n\nApart from AI, Nvidia continues to target gaming technology by introducing its first digital human technology small language model, Nemotron-4 4B Instruct.\n\nAlso Read: Taiwan Semiconductor Expands to Europe with $11B Chip Plant in Germany: Report\n\nThe innovation will likely transform the gameplay experience by enhancing character interactions in the new multiplayer mech game Mecha BREAK, developed by Amazing Seasun Games, a subsidiary of Kingsoft Cloud Holdings (NASDAQ:KC).\n\nThe technology is optimized for GeForce RTX AI PCs and laptops, making it easier for developers to deploy advanced digital human technology in next-generation games like Mecha BREAK.\n\nNvidia has also unveiled a generative AI weather model that promises to revolutionize short-range weather forecasting. The new model, StormCast, marks a significant leap forward in predicting extreme weather events, such as flash floods and tornado outbreaks, with greater accuracy down to the kilometer scale, Axios reports.\n\nNvidia’s StormCast can operate at the mesoscale level, which allows it to resolve small-scale weather systems and incorporate complex atmospheric physics, such as how thunderstorms form, intensify, and dissipate.\n\nAnalyst Rating: Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated an Outperform rating on Nvidia with a price target of $150.\n\nNvidia trades at 29x calendar year 2026 versus the five-year average of 36x. Schafer flagged the company’s best-in-group gross and operating margin profile.\n\nNvidia remains the purest scale play on AI proliferation. Schafer said Data Center AI leads sustained structural growth as accelerator attach increases.\n\nHe noted that Nvidia’s entrenched DC AI ecosystem is core to GenAI adoption. Schafer remains a long-term buyer.\n\nSchafer expects an upside for second-quarter results and third-quarter outlook, led by sustained cloud service providers (CSPs) and enterprise AI demand.\n\nThe lead times have normalized despite the tight supply, which is gated by advanced packaging capacity. The B100 is on track for a low-volume fourth-quarter market introduction with a meaningful ramp in the first quarter as Chip-On-Wafer-On-Substrate-L (CoWoS-L) supply improves.\n\nThe analyst expects Hopper to fill demand in the interim. Blackwell Ultra is anticipated by late fiscal 2025, Ruben+Vera due fiscal 2026, and Ruben Ultra by fiscal 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move to rack-scale leveraged Nvidia’s unique end-to-end software connectivity accelerator platform. The analyst noted that GB200 NVL36 and GB200 NVL72 racks further separate Nvidia from the competition.\n\nSchafer projects second-quarter net sales and EPS of $28.04 billion and $0.62.\n\nPrice Action: NVDA stock traded lower by 1.50% to $128.08 at the last check Tuesday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNvidia Hedge Fund Ownership Shifts, Citadel Cuts Stake While Renaissance Buys In: Report\n\nImage via Nvidia Blog\n\nLatest Ratings for NVDA\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Goldman Sachs Reinstates Neutral Feb 2022 Summit Insights Group Downgrades Buy Hold Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for NVDA\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Tuesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Tuesday, August 20, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Star Group, L.P. (SGU) and Aware, Inc. (AWRE). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have lagged the the Zacks Tech sector past year ( +28.8% vs. +38.6%), but performed roughly in-line with the broader market (+28.8% vs. +27.5% for the S&P 500 index). Weighing on the stock's muted momentum is the macro overhang from China whose economic outlook continues to remain uncertian. The company reported decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues. \r\n\r\nApple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. \r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+160.7% vs. +114.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. \r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. \r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. +11.3%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In second-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, with both metrics showing year-over-year improvement. \r\n\r\nStrong revenue growth across most operating segments, supported by improved price/mix and unit volume growth aided results. KO is well-poised to benefit from innovations and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024. \r\n\r\nHowever, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Star have gained +6.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry’s gain of +11.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $409.70 million witnessed strong revenue growth, driven by a 25.3% increase in heating oil and propane volumes, and improved margins despite warmer weather. \r\n\r\nStrategic acquisitions are bolstering market position, adding significant volume and operational synergies. The company has enhanced profitability by reducing its adjusted EBITDA loss by $18.9 million and maintaining strong cost control, leading to improved margins. Star Group's leadership in home heating, diversification into related services and a robust balance sheet with solid cash flow management further strengthen its investment case. \r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include declining heating oil volumes, weather sensitivity, customer attrition and rising operating expenses. Additionally, the company faces competitive pressures from alternative energy sources, which could impact market share and profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Star here >>>)\r\n\r\nAware’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry over the year-to-date period (+48.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $53.17 million witnessed 17% revenue growth in the first half of 2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and a 14% rise in recurring revenue, reflects a shift toward a subscription model and underscores its market expansion and improved financial predictability. \r\n\r\nStrategic cost management reduced operating expenses by 7%, narrowing net losses and enhancing adjusted EBITDA. The shift to a recurring revenue model, with a 31% second-quarter 2024 revenue uptick, and securing large contracts, including a $1.2 million automated biometric identification system (ABIS) deal, highlight Aware's growing global footprint. \r\n\r\nYet, declining cash reserves, continued net losses, reliance on government contracts and limited market diversification pose significant risks. Increasing competition and execution risks in strategic initiatives could pressure revenue growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Aware here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Lower COVID-19 sales and slower economic activity in China continue to pose concerns.\n\nPfizer's (PFE) New Products Can Drive Long-Term Sales Growth\r\nThough Pfizer's (PFE) revenues from COVID products are declining, non-COVID operational revenue growth is improving, driven by its key in-line products, new launches and newly acquired products.\n\nFund-Raising Ability Aids Blackstone (BX), High Costs Ails\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Blackstone's solid fund-rising capability and asset inflows will likely aid profitability. Yet, mounting expenses and low capital distribution sustainability are major woes.\n\nIntel (INTC) Rides on Solid AI Traction & Product Innovation\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, a strong emphasis on developing leading-edge AI chips to match the increasing demand for AI PCs will likely boost Intel's top line.

        "title": "Nvidia helped the stock market storm back, but this summer’s broadening theme never went away",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\n\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\n\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\n\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\n\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\n\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\n\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations.\n\n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\" A sign is displayed on a Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\n\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\n\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\n\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\n\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024.\n\nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, Ned Davis's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Are Investors Dumping Their Tech Stocks? 4 Reasons the Technology Sector Is Getting Hammered.",
        "content": "The tech sector is often volatile, and not always in an investor-friendly way.\n\nWall Street took a beating in recent weeks, with the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index falling 8.5% from July 16 to Aug. 5. Over the same period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index recorded a 12.3% price drop. And the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT), which focuses on stocks in the tech sector, posted a 14.8% drop.\n\nThe plunge was led by some true heavyweights. Artificial intelligence (AI) chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) posted a 20.5% price drop in that three-week period, for example. AI systems builder Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) -- also known as Supermicro -- took a 30.6% hit over the same period, and chipmaking veteran Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) suffered a 41.4% crash.\n\nThe market is already coming back from that dramatic dip, but the tech sector still lags behind the broader market. Let's look at the driving forces behind this tech sector takedown and what it all means for investors.\n\n1. Mixed earnings reports\n\nThe third earnings season of 2024 is already winding down, and it hasn't always been kind to tech investors. Many trend-setting tech stocks either delivered disappointing results or set modest guidance goals for the back half of the year, often with price-cutting effects.\n\nThe list of market-moving earnings reports includes Supermicro and Intel. Both fell short of Wall Street's consensus earnings targets and reported challenging potholes in the road ahead. Intel's issues inspired a $10 billion cost-cutting program and hit the pause button on the company's dividend program.\n\nManagement comments shed some light on what's going on:\n\n\"Second-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, reflecting a tough economy. Hold that thought. Supermicro CEO Charles Liang noted that the company's long-term investments in factories are holding back its bottom-line results. \"We anticipate that the short-term margin pressure will ease and return to normal range before the end of fiscal year 2025,\" he said. Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) chief financial officer Jason Child offered soft full-year revenue and margin guidance as, he said, \"inventory issues in the industrial Internet of Things and networking markets seem to be more persistent than originally suggested.\" In other words, outperformance in recent quarters led to overstuffed product pipelines and warehouses. In The Trade Desk's (NASDAQ: TTD) earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said that his ad-buying customers \"are dealing with a lot of uncertainty.\" Companies are doing well, but consumers hold on tightly to their families' wallets, reducing the effectiveness of marketing messages. \"That has significant implications on how companies market products, from pricing to packaging to advertising,\" Green said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are some common threads among these analyses. Most of these guiding lights lead me back to...\n\n2. ...that darn economy\n\nThe inflation crisis in winding down, the Federal Reserve is planning to cut interest rates in September, and the overall economy is getting back on its feet.\n\nBut the economic crisis isn't finished yet, and there's still room for nervous investor reactions. Every suggestion that the rate cuts might be delayed causes another market dip. A slight rate increase in Japan unleashed another bearish market reaction around the world. Add the insights and worries voiced by business leaders in the last section, and this bull market starts to feel unstable.\n\nThat's bad news for high-flying market darlings. It's not great for up-and-coming innovators of the future, too -- this looks like a problematic time to seek funding or go public. As a result, both established leaders and smaller upstarts are taking hits to their perceived market values.\n\n3. Investors are losing patience with the stalled AI boom\n\nOf course, the list of deep price drops includes many of the leading names in AI technology. Nvidia's drop alone removed $637 billion of market value from the AI surge. That company didn't even report results in July -- its second-quarter update is scheduled for Aug. 28.  Here, investors are applying lessons learned from sector peers to Nvidia's situation.\n\nAnd maybe -- just maybe -- market makers got a little too enthusiastic about the early AI boom.\n\nYes, generative AI is a game-changing technology, but there are questions hanging in the air. For instance:\n\nHow quickly will that revolution lead to sustainable changes to business results in the AI sector? Nvidia's early hardware lead could fade as other chip designers develop comparable hardware, perhaps at a lower cost or more efficient power and cooling solutions. OpenAI's ChatGPT is the cat's pajamas among large language models (LLMs) so far, but another engine could steal its title someday. And I have heard many business leaders fret about the industry-changing powers of generative AI, but there aren't many real-world examples of that effect yet.\n\nSome of these concerns might never materialize, and this could just be a short lull in the frantic pace of AI innovation. But perception quickly becomes a reality in the stock market, and every investor works with an incomplete set of information about the current and future state of affairs.\n\nAnd on that note, my final section kind of writes itself.\n\n4. Time to take some profits?\n\nDespite the recent price drops, the market darlings of AI are still up by a lot. On Aug. 5, at the very bottom of the brief panic, Nvidia and Supermicro shares had still more than doubled year to date. Arm Holdings held a 47% gain on that date.\n\nI can't blame worried investors for converting some paper gains into cash profits under those circumstances. The resulting price cuts made the same stocks a little more affordable for the next wave of bullish AI investors, and the beat goes on.\n\nIn the end, the recent drop in tech stocks boiled down to the usual market noise. Opportunistic investors should keep an eye out for this type of short-lived buying opportunity, with the obvious caveat that the next downward move might have staying power. Nobody really knows until it happens.\n\nUntil then, it's best to take a calm look at the current market and rearrange your portfolio to fit your long-term views. Personally, I'm a little worried about Nvidia's grip on the hardware crown while Intel and The Trade Desk look undervalued today. Your mileage may vary, but feel free to start your next stock-picking research binge right there.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AMD Buys ZT: Can Expanding AI Footprint Push the Stock Higher?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD is strengthening its data center AI footprint with the announced acquisition of ZT Systems for roughly $4.9 billion in cash and stock. The transaction includes a contingent payment of up to $400 million upon achieving certain milestones post-completion. \r\n\r\nThe deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will expand AMD’s data center AI footprint. ZT System serves a number of the world’s largest hyperscalers through its AI and general-purpose compute infrastructure offerings. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition will help AMD offer optimized rack-scale solutions in the data center AI accelerator market, which is expected to hit roughly $400 billion in 2027.\r\n\r\nAMD expects the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis by the end of 2025.\n\nAMD Stock Rides on Strong Data Center Demand\n\nAMD shares have jumped more than 37% since its second quarter 2024 (Jul 30), outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 28.5%.\n\nAMD Stock Outperforms Sector Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe semiconductor chip provider has been riding on strong performance of the Data Center segment. In the second quarter of 2024, Data Center revenues surged 114.5% year over year to $2.83 billion and accounted for 48.6% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 21%. \r\n\r\nIn the data center AI business, MI300 quarterly revenues exceeded $1 billion for the first time.\r\n\r\nAMD has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem. In the past 12 months, it has spent $125 million on a dozen of acquisitions. Nod.ai and Mipsology are some other notable acquisitions in the recent past. It recently closed the acquisition of Helsinki, Finland-based Silo AI. \r\n\r\nAMD’s acquisitiveness is aimed at primarily reducing the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the ongoing race for AI dominance. NVIDIA shares have gained 177% since Jul 30, 2024.\n\nStrong Portfolio Boosts AMD’s Prospects\n\nBoth AMD and NVDA have been the darlings of investors, driven by the massive proliferation of AI that has created a strong demand for GPU chips required to power AI models. The AI space is expected to remain robust with increased spending by cloud computing providers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. \r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Microsoft expanded its usage of MI300X accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple co-pilot services, including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word and Teams. It also became the first large hyperscaler to announce the general availability of public MI300X instances.\r\n\r\nAMD’s initiatives to expand its portfolio are making it well-positioned to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market. \r\n\r\nNew offerings like the Instinct MI325X accelerator are helping to expand AMD’s footprint in the data center market. AMD has launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs. \r\n\r\nHowever, AMD suffers from the challenging macroeconomic environment and rising uncertainty over the upcoming Presidential elections, given its much smaller size and GPU market share compared to NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s strategy to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline intensifies competition for AMD. \r\n\r\nFor third-quarter 2024, AMD expects the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenues to decline year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimate Revision Shows Downward Trend\n\nAMD expects third-quarter 2024 revenues to be $6.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 16% and sequential growth of approximately 15%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $6.71 billion, indicating 15.71% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 90 cents per share, down 3.2% over the past 30 days but suggesting 28.57% year-over-year growth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\n\nAMD Stock Overvalued\n\nAMD stock is overvalued, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 8.45X compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.44X.\n\nP/S Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD’s near-term prospects are dull, given the weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments amid stiff competition from NVIDIA. AMD has a Growth Score of D, which makes the stock unattractive for growth-oriented investors. \r\n\r\nHowever, AMD’s expanding portfolio, thanks to acquisitions of Silo AI and ZT Systems, is expected to boost its top-line growth.\r\n\r\nAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. However, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.

        "content": "Cisco Is Making Its AI Push Through Realignment\n\nCisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal fourth quarter results that revealed declining earnings and revenue. The networking company still managed to surpass estimates despite revenue decline for the third continous time this year. Partnered with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Cisco remains confident of being equipped to break new ground in AI. In order to secure the new era, Cisco is undergoing a significant restructuring, during which it is realigning its portfolio and trimming its workforce for the second time this year.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on July 27th, revenue dropped 10% YoY to $13.64 billion, slightly above LSEG’s estimate of $13.54 billion. Sales fell for a third straight quarter, with full fiscal year revenue declining  for the first time since 2020. Security revenue surged 81% to $1.8 billion, but networking revenue slumped 28% to $6.8 billion. Collaboration revenue remained flat at $1 billion.\n\nNet income in the quarter dropped to 45% to $2.2 billion, or 54 cents a share. Adjusted earnings per share fell 24% as they amounted to 87 cents per share, also surpassing LSEG’s 85 cents per share.\n\nGuidance\n\nThe revenue decline trend is projected to last for one more period. For the current quarter, Cisco guided for revenue between $13.65 billion and $13.85 billion, down from $14.7 billion reported for previous year's comparable quarter. LSEG guided for $13.7 billion.\n\nThe AI Push Continues\n\nSupported by its partnership with Nvidia, Cisco will be investing in key high growth opportunities like AI cybersecurity as it focuses to improve its business efficiencies. Cisco continues to trim its workfroce with the second major round of layoffs this year. Following February’s 5% workforce reduction, Cisco announced another 7% cut.\n\nThis is part of Cisco’s restructuring plan that will result in $1 billion in pretax charges to its financial results. During the current quarter, $700 million to $800 million of charges will be recognized, with rest being distributed over fiscal 2025.\n\nDespite sales continuing to drop for third consecutive quarter, Cisco suprassed estiamtes fueled by its  biggest deal ever, the $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, which closed in March and brought increased subscription revenue. Splunk brought in revenue of $960 million.\n\nThe networking giant remains focused on high-growth areas.\n\nCisco has shifted away from its core business of selling network switches and routers, increasing revenue from software and services through acquisitions. However, CFO Scott Herren insisted that the restructuring plan is more about reallocating as opposed to pursuing cost savings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer’s Latest Calls: Top 10 Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program said that if companies would “own up” to the changing circumstances, things would be “so much easier” for them as well as investors.\n\n“There is so much information and misinformation flying around at this point in the earnings season that it’s very easy to be led astray,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer thinks companies are “leaving out” important information which can cause investors to make “faulty decisions.”\n\nAs an example, Cramer talked about how food and beverage companies are not talking about the impact of weight loss drugs on their financials\n\nCramer said that GLP-1 drugs are extremely “powerful” and they cause a decline in cravings for snacks and liquor. This, according to Cramer, directly affects beverage and snack companies. However, Cramer said these companies are intentionally not mentioning the impact of these drugs.\n\n“I wonder how long they can maintain this fiction, it’ll be better if they just own that it’s a problem rather than just ignoring it.”\n\nCramer was also furious that consumer companies are not admitting that high prices are impacting their financials. He said hotels and entertainment companies raised prices in the past but now they are not willing to bring them down despite facing pricing headwinds.\n\nCramer also called the claims that huge AI investments are not bringing any solid results for companies “absurd.”\n\nWe watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls: Top 10 Stocks?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nCramer said in a latest program that he believes Nvidia “can be bought at a certain level” but thinks the stock is “hated right now.”\n\n“People feel there is something very wrong with it, we have to wait and see,” Cramer said.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls: Top 10 Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Bank of America strategists disclosed on Tuesday the eight most widely held individual stocks globally. Based on the percentage of relevant funds holding these stocks, the top holdings are TSMC (94%), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (87%), Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) (85%), HDFC Bank (81%), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (77%), Sony (NYSE:SONY) (75%), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) (75%), and ASML (AS:ASML) (75%).\n\nIn July, as global equities saw a 1.5% rally, long-only funds globally increased their active equity exposure by a total of $10.1 billion, according to BofA’s analysis of 7,746 funds managing $30 trillion.\n\nIndustrials emerged as the favored sector for the month. Funds notably boosted their active exposure to Europe by $10.5 billion, with $7.8 billion directed specifically towards Industrials.\n\nIn the U.S., while overall active exposure remained relatively stable with a $1.2 billion increase, there was a significant $30.3 billion rise in exposure to Industrials, alongside a reduction in Consumer Discretionary and Tech holdings.\n\nAccording to BofA, this shift aligns with historical trends, where the global Industrials sector typically outperforms during periods of economic upturn, as indicated by the rising Global Wave, the bank’s economic indicator that tracks the global business cycle.\n\nYear-to-date, long-only funds have shown increasing optimism about the global economic cycle by reducing cash levels and reallocating from bonds to equities.\n\nThese funds have added a cumulative $58.4 billion to global equities, with the largest increases seen in Europe ($27.9 billion), the U.S. ($18.2 billion), Emerging Markets ($15.2 billion), and APxJ ($7.3 billion). This has more than offset the $10.2 billion reduction in active exposure to Japan, strategists point out.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese 8 names are the most widely held stocks in the world\n\nPwC loses major client Bank of China amid regulatory probe\n\nKingsoft Cloud Q2 revenue rises, stock dips premarket\n\nView comments",

That is, the only 15 people on planet Earth who have 12-figure fortunes.\n\nTogether, their combined wealth exceeds $2.2 trillion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That's more than the market cap of Google-parent Alphabet, at $2 trillion, or Amazon at $1.8 trillion.\n\nMost of those with net worth above $100 billion founded tech companies and, as a result, own huge amounts of stock in some of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nWith an estimated net worth of $245 billion, Tesla, X and Space X owner Elon Musk sits at the top of the list, followed by Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos, and then Bernard Arnault the founder and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company.\n\nFrenchman Arnault is just one of two European centibillionaires to make the list, including including Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Inditex fashion group, perhaps best known for its chains Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka.\n\nOrtega, who still owns 59% of Inditex, joined the club just last month as the retail group posted record sales.\n\nMost other members of the $100 billion club are based in America.\n\nThe 15 billionaires with net worth over $100 billion, as estimated by Bloomberg:\n\n1. Elon Musk, Tesla, X and SpaceX owner\r\nNet worth: $245B\n\n2. Jeff Bezos, Amazon and Blue Origin founder\r\nNet worth: $201B\n\n3. Bernard Arnault, LVMH founder and CEO\r\nNet worth: $197B\n\n4. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta co-founder and CEO\r\nNet worth: $188B\n\n5. Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder \r\nNet worth: $158B\n\n6. Larry Ellison, Oracle cofounder \r\nNet worth: $153B\n\n7. Larry Page, Alphabet co-founder \r\nNet worth: $150B\n\n8. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s former CEO and owner of the NBA’s Los Angeles Clippers\r\nNet worth: $146B\n\n9.

Amancio Ortega, Inditex founder \r\nNet worth: $105B\n\nAll but one of them have grown richer this year—despite stock troubles and charitable donations\n\nArnault—who started the year as the world’s richest person—would be over $10 billion richer, if it wasn’t for a stock price bloodbath in the European luxury sector earlier this year.\n\nHe is the only member of the $100 billion club whose net worth has tumbled this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany others on the list would be much wealthier if it weren’t for the recent dip in big tech shares.\n\nEarlier this month, the world’s 500 richest people saw $134 billion wiped from their fortunes overnight, thanks to AI uncertainty and high-profile earnings disappointments.\n\nBezos saw a nearly $16 billion drop in his wealth in one day, when Amazon’s shares fell by nearly 9% on August 2.\n\nLikewise, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Page’s net worth took a $3 billion hit each.\n\nRemarkably, others like Gates and Warren Buffett are still on the list despite giving billions to charity and pledging to drop off the list of the world’s wealthiest people altogether.\n\nThe Microsoft cofounder has vouched to give away “virtually all” of his $158 billion fortune to address society’s most pressing problems. The 68-year-old reckons it'll take him 20 years to hit his goal.\n\nNvidia's Jensen Huang is a newcomer to the list\n\nAs well as Ortega, Jensen Huang is another new entrant to $100 billion club.\n\nThe Nvidia co-founder and CEO saw his wealth balloon from $44 billion at the start of this year to around $114 billion today, thanks to the success of his chipmaker company.\n\nNvidia has made itself a key player in the AI boom by supplying hardware to companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. It’s now the second most valuable company in the world—worth over $3 trillion—behind only Apple.\n\nThe elite club, which had just one member in 2020, could get even bigger soon. Three members of the Walton family—which owns Walmart—are sitting on $92 billion-plus fortunes after each grew at least $22 billion richer this year.\n\nBut either way, centibillionaires shouldn't get too comfortable.\n\nBettencourt Meyers, an heir to the L'Oreal fortune, became the first woman to amass a 12-figure fortune in December last year, after shares of the cosmetics company posted their best year since 1998.\n\nBut her time in the $100 billion club was fleeting and her net worth has since dropped below $90 billion.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AMD’s ZT acquisition marks a new chapter in the chip maker’s chase of Nvidia",
        "content": "It’s not every Monday where I wake up, and as I’m babysitting my pour-over coffee, I go: \"Oh, wow, that’s a doozy of a deal.\"\n\nBut there I was yesterday morning as the news dropped that AMD is buying server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in a cash-and-stock deal.\n\nAnd, sure, it’s not setting any records for price. But at a time when big-ticket deals, particularly if they involve AI, have been vexed by regulatory fears, it’s striking to see a decisive, multibillion-dollar acquisition by a publicly traded tech company. The math of this deal hints at its importance to AMD: The chip-maker is paying 75% in cash, and the company reported about $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2.\n\nThere are some other interesting wrinkles, if you take a closer look: For example, AMD says it’s not planning on keeping all of ZT as it currently stands, and is looking to sell ZT’s manufacturing business once the transaction’s closed. (AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su told Reuters this means that AMD won't be competing with Super Micro.)\n\nHowever, this is a deal that's about competition, as so many at this level are: Back when I covered the public markets, analysts often talked about AMD as the Nvidia challenger with a half-decent shot at making a dent in Nvidia-mania. And the acquisition of ZT fits squarely into this narrative: AMD plans to take this AI infrastructure provider, known for working with large cloud companies, and supercharge its AI data center, inference, and training capabilities.\n\n\"This acquisition is expected to have a substantial impact on AMD's competitive positioning,” said Joe Endoso, CEO of investment platform Linqto, via email. \"Nvidia’s comprehensive offering has made it easier for developers to build AI applications on its chips. By acquiring ZT Systems, AMD is better equipped to compete with Nvidia’s integrated approach, potentially offering similar end-to-end solutions and capturing a larger share of the lucrative AI infrastructure market.\"\n\nBut there are also surrounding circumstances here bigger than AMD, bigger than even Nvidia—the AI ecosystem overall is growing and shifting rapidly. Right now M&A (or everything but) is a big story when it comes to venture-backed AI startups. We’ve seen numerous acquisitions, frequently by companies like Databricks, and high-profile acqui-hires, from Adept to Character. And the dealmaking likely isn’t over, and changes are coming anomalously fast.\n\n\"In every transition I’ve seen, it typically takes a long time to consolidate,\" said Umesh Padval, Thomvest Ventures managing director. \"But in AI, because the cost of developing AI is so massive and it’s moving at a very fast pace. I’ve never seen the pace of innovation in AI in anything else—mobile phones, networking, PCs, anything. So, there’s this acceleration of consolidation. People just started investing in AI early last year. That was the boom. And 18 months later, companies are being sold, you have deals like Inflection. It’s consolidating much faster than I’ve seen in my lifetime, in 40 years.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, ZT is its own ball of wax. The company was founded in 1994 by Frank Zhang, who still leads it and will join AMD post-deal. The only external funding I've found so far is a $850 million debt raise from 2023, according to PitchBook. So, there probably aren’t any VCs out there who are having an especially good week in light of ZT’s sale (if you’re out there, speak now or forever hold your peace).\n\nStill, it’s hard to disentangle AMD’s ZT deal from the broader wheeling and dealing that’s rippling through the AI landscape. In some sense, I think of them as parallel stories—not the same, but within the same universe: The race to challenge Nvidia exists across from the venture-fueled world of high-flying AI valuations that (in some cases) have become disappointments.\n\nBut everyone's also doing more or less the same dance (or at least, dancing some of the same steps). Across the public and private markets, up and down the food chain, investors and businesses are locked in a delicate waltz based on assumptions about how much demand there will ultimately be for AI products and services. (This is a point that Sequoia’s David Cahn makes thoroughly in this Aug. 12 blog post.)\n\nRight now, there’s demand for AI of all sorts. But that demand staying in place requires public companies like AMD to continue spending on it, and acquiring private companies in the sector. For the time being, it seems like they will.\n\n\"We are always looking strategically at organic and M&A investments to ensure we are positioning ourselves for future growth,\" an AMD spokesperson confirmed to Fortune.\n\nThere's also every indication that AI consolidation will likely continue, in fragmented and sometimes surprising ways. So, I may not be huddling over my pour-over every day saying, \"wow, another doozy of a deal!\" But I suspect it won’t be the last time before the year’s out.\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\r\nTwitter:@agarfinks\r\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\r\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nNina Ajemian curated the deals section of today’s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Just Sold Nvidia to Buy This Chip Stock",
        "content": "Billionaire Paul Singer and his fund, Elliott Investment Management, is making waves. The fund had been in active discussions with Starbucks on a turnaround plan that subsequently saw the company name a new CEO. It's also been in a very public fight with Southwest Airlines and just nominated 10 new board members for the airline.\n\nIn tech land, meanwhile, the fund dumped its shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) while starting a new position in Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM).\n\nThe sale of Nvidia isn't surprising after Elliott called artificial intelligence (AI) \"overhyped\" in a letter to shareholders earlier this month. He added that the technology consumes too much energy and will never become cost-efficient. The letter added that Nvidia was currently in \"bubble land.\"\n\nInstead, it appears Singer and company are placing their bets on fellow chipmaker Arm in the technology space.\n\nWhat makes Arm different?\n\nWhile Nvidia has been greatly benefiting from increased spending related to the AI infrastructure buildout, Arm has been a big beneficiary of the proliferation of smartphones. In fact, its technology can be found in virtually all smartphones around the globe.\n\nArm also has a very different business model than Nvidia. While Nvidia designs it own chips, Arm licenses its technology for use by other chipmakers. The company then collects royalties, based on the number of chips shipped built on its architecture. Once its technology is designed into a product, Arm can collect royalties for years or even decades. The company has said that nearly half its royalty income comes from products released between 1990 and 2012.\n\nMore recently, Arm has been shifting customers to a subscription model where they can get access to a broad array of the company's intellectual property. At the end of Q2, it had 33 customers using its Arm Total Access platform and 241 using its Arm Flexible Access platform.\n\nWhile the company is the leader in the smartphone space, it's now looking to take a major share in the Windows-based personal computer (PC) market. The company has a goal of gaining at least 50% market share in the space in the next five years.\n\nIt's already in all Mac-based computers and will look to capitalize on PC makers trying to make their laptop designs more similar to MacBook Airs. It's also been taking share in the automotive market, seeing growth of 28% in the vertical in Q2.\n\nWhile Elliott has recently said that AI is overhyped, Arm has also been benefiting from the AI buildout. On its Q2 earnings call, the company said it was seeing increased licensing in the AI data center due to the need for customization, which then requires Arm-based chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also has a collaborative chip with Nvidia called the Grace Hopper, which integrates an Arm-based central processing unit (CPU) with a Nvidia Hopper graphics proccessing unit (GPU). It will also be designed into Nvidia's next-generation Grace Blackwell chip.\n\nIn addition, Arm technology has been used for new CPU data center chips from both Alphabet and Amazon. While Arm isn't benefiting as much as Nvidia from the buildout of AI infrastructure, it's still benefiting. Meanwhile, cloud computing companies continue to pour money into building this infrastructure. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it time to buy Arm?\n\nElliott's investment in Arm likely extends a bit beyond the company to its largest shareholder Softbank(OTC: SFTBF), which owns about 90% of the chipmaker. In June, it was revealed that Elliott had taken an over $2 billion stake in the Japanese investment firm. Elliott has called for Softbank to buyback $15 billion in stock, while the company recently announced a lesser $3.4 billion repurchase plan.\n\nGiven Elliott's comments on AI, the fund also probably would like Softbank and Arm to move away from their plans to develop their own AI chips and build out AI data centers around the globe. It's also possible that Elliott has taken an anti-AI stance to try to persuade Softball and Arm of this and, instead, buy back its stock.\n\nElliott has stakes in both Softbank and Arm, so the fund's ultimate play is unknown. Looking at Arm in isolation, its stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 63.5 times, based on 2025 analyst estimates. That's exponentially more expensive than Nvidia, although Arm arguably has one of the most attractive business models in the chip space, given the amount of time it collects royalties on products, as well as the license revenue it generates. ARM PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nFollowing Arm's recent pullback, I think the stock is more attractive now than previously. Still, I'd prefer to take a start position and dollar-cost average into the stock on any future weakness than pile into it at this time, given its valuation. Meanwhile, if Elliott is correct that AI is overhyped, its Arm investment isn't immune to an AI downturn.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AMD (AMD)\n\nAMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9bn (£3.77bn) cash and stock transaction, as the chip company seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34bn in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe chipmaker said ZT Systems, will help it \"deliver leadership AI training and inferencing solutions\" and will also help \"cloud and enterprise customers significantly accelerate the deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale\".

Net income was $357.7m or $1.01 per share, gaining from the year prior and ahead of projections.\n\nFor the full year of fiscal 2024, revenue and net income were stronger than analysts expected at $8.03bn and $2.58bn, respectively.\n\nThe firm expects revenue between $9.1bn and $9.15bn, up between 12% and 13% year-over-year in line with estimates of $9.11bn.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company expects revenue to grow between 12% and 13% to between $2.1bn and $2.13bn, compared to estimates of $2.11bn.\n\n\"We finished off the year with strong execution on our platformisation strategy,\" Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora said, adding that \"as we look forward to fiscal year 2025 and beyond, we are focused on scaling our Next-Generation Security business through continued innovation and execution\".\n\nStory continues\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nMedia executive Edgar Bronfman Jr on Monday submitted a $4.3bn bid for acquiring National Amusements, the company that holds a controlling interest in entertainment giant Paramount Global, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBronfman's offer includes $2.4bn in debt and equity for National Amusements. He also would contribute $1.5bn to Paramount's balance sheet, which could be used to pay down.\n\nHis bid comes over a month after Redstone entered a deal with David Ellison’s Skydance Global, which will merge Paramount with Skydance and create a new company with Ellison at the helm.\n\nRead more: UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch among those missing in Sicily yacht disaster\n\nThat agreement contained a 45-day \"go-shop period\" that allowed Paramount to solicit and evaluate other offers. That period ends on 21 August, but can be extended.\n\nBronfman’s offer potentially complicates Paramount’s fate, especially as the Skydance merger was reached after years of negotiations with different parties. The bid adds $400m to cover a breakup fee to end a rival deal.\n\nA special committee of Paramount's board is expected to meet Wednesday to determine whether Bronfman's offer has a reasonable probability of succeeding.\n\nAntofagasta (ANTO.L)\n\nAntofagasta’s pretax profit declined in line with market expectations in the first six months of the year, when strong commodity prices offset lower sales volumes.\n\nThe Chilean copper miner said its pretax profit fell 7% to $712.6m in the half-year from $764.5m in the same period last year. This is still above the consensus forecast of $710.6m.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the first six months of the year rose to $1.39bn from $1.33bn last year.\n\nThe company saw increased depreciation and amortisation, mainly due to the start of depreciating the assets at the Los Pelambres Phase 1 Expansion project, which is now in operation.\n\nLooking ahead, the miner reaffirmed full-year production guidance for output to be at the lower end of the 670,000-710,000 tonne range.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are (Still) Selling It and Buying Shares of These 2 Hypergrowth Stocks Hand Over Fist Instead",
        "content": "While all eyes were turned to the July inflation report, investors may have missed what can be described as the most-important data release of the quarter on Aug. 14. I'm talking about the filing date for institutional investors to report Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA 13F is a snapshot that details the buying and selling activity of Wall Street's brightest money managers in the most recent quarter. Despite 13Fs offering a snapshot that's up to 45 days old when filed with the SEC, they can still provide important clues as to what stocks, industries, sectors, and trends (cough, artificial intelligence (AI), cough) have been piquing the interest of top-tier asset managers.

Shares of Nvidia have blasted higher by more than 700% since 2023 began, equating to an increase in market value of $2.7 trillion. No market leader has ever increased in value so quickly before.\n\nBut there are a number of logical reasons beyond just profit-taking that may explain this ongoing selling by billionaire investors.\n\nFor one, history has proved incredibly unkind to next-big-thing innovations. There hasn't been a game-changing technology for 30 years that's avoided an early stage bubble. Further, investors consistently overestimate how quickly a new technology will be adopted and mature. This all points to an AI bubble-bursting event at some point in the future.\n\nNvidia should also contend with competitive pressures. Even though its graphics processing units (GPUs) have an inside track to maintaining their compute advantage in AI-accelerated data centers, Nvidia's inability to meet overwhelming demand, coupled with lower price points from competitors, should allow rivals to grab share.\n\nLastly, Nvidia would need to execute flawlessly for it to sustain its historic increase in value. Recent reports that its next-generation Blackwell platform is delayed by ay least three months due to design flaws point to Nvidia being just as fallible as any other company.\n\nBut as billionaires were showing shares of Nvidia to the proverbial door during the second quarter, they were busy scooping up shares of two other hypergrowth stocks. Image source: Pinterest.\n\nHypergrowth stock No. 1 billionaires can't stop buying: Pinterest\n\nThe first fast-paced growth stock prominent billionaires were buying as they were shedding shares of Nvidia is social media platform Pinterest(NYSE: PINS). Four billionaires meaningfully added to their respective fund's existing stakes, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,472,384 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (516,909 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (370,502 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (148,578 shares)\n\nAlthough there's some near-term concern about ad spending and the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape, Pinterest looks to be perfectly positioned to take advantage of multiple long-term catalysts.\n\nTo start with, it's an ad-driven social media platform, and the U.S./global economy spend a disproportionate amount of time expanding, relative to contracting. Though recessions are normal and inevitable, they don't stick around very long. This means ad-focused platforms benefit from lengthy periods of economic growth.\n\nPinterest's steadily growing monthly active user (MAU) count is another selling point. With 522 million MAUs, Pinterest has a large enough audience that businesses will pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Not surprisingly, sales grew 21% in the June-ended quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nBut perhaps the most-overlooked yet important advantage Pinterest offers, relative to other social media platforms, is its ability to help merchants target its MAUs.\n\nMost sites rely heavily on data-tracking tools and \"likes\" to help businesses target users with their message(s). But with app developers giving consumers the choice to turn off data-tracking tools, it's made life difficult for certain social media platforms.\n\nPinterest's entire operating model is built on the idea of its MAUs freely and willingly sharing the things, places, and services that interest them. This is invaluable information Pinterest can serve up to merchants, and data-tracking tool changes won't impact it.\n\nHypergrowth stock No. 2 billionaire money managers are buying hand over fist: Intuitive Surgical\n\nThe other hypergrowth stock that billionaire investors were actively buying in the second quarter while sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is robotic-assisted surgical systems developer Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG). A trio of top-notch billionaires added to their existing stakes, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (552,230 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (125,150 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (48,591 shares)\n\nArguably the biggest lure for investors with Intuitive Surgical is its market share-leading status when it comes to robotic-assisted surgical systems in use in operating rooms. The company closed out June with 9,203 of its systems installed worldwide. Considering the high cost of these systems ($0.5 million to $2.5 million) and the time needed to train surgeons, clients tend to stick with the company over the long run.\n\nIntuitive Surgical's razor-and-blades operating model is another source of its sustained double-digit sales and earnings growth. The company secures long-term clients by selling or leasing its da Vinci surgical systems. However, these are intricate systems to develop and manufacture, so the margins associated with them are mediocre, at best.\n\nWhere Intuitive Surgical generates the lion's share of its operating income and cash flow is from growth in instruments sold with each procedure and regular servicing of its systems. These two sales channels offer considerably higher margins and are growing into a larger percentage of Intuitive Surgical's net sales over time.\n\nDon't overlook the highly defensive nature of healthcare stocks, either. Regardless of what happens with the U.S. economy, people still become ill and require medical care. While it's possible some optional surgical treatments could be delayed, as we witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the bulk of Intuitive Surgical's operating cash flow is well-insulated from \"hiccups\" in the U.S. economy.\n\nHowever, Intuitive Surgical is also historically pricey. A forward price-to-earnings ratio of 63, coupled with Wall Street's annualized five-year earnings growth forecast of 14%, leaves little room for error and upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its second-quarter results of fiscal 2025 on Aug. 28, with significant attention expected on management's comments regarding potential delays in the release of its next-generation Blackwell (BW) chip, and the company's ability to meet demand.\n\nStifel analysts said Monday their discussions with industry participants revealed that any delays are likely to be measured in months rather than quarters. In the interim, feedback on the demand for H-Series chips remains positive.\n\nAs a result, the investment bank again expects a beat-and-raise scenario for Nvidia’s upcoming results and guidance.\n\n“We are not expecting any meaningful change in tone or messaging relative to what NVDA has focused on since the company reported its F1Q results, i.e. the company’s longer-term road map and continued investment in organic and collaborative software offerings,” Stifel analysts said in a note.\n\nMoreover, they believe that recent commentary from optical transceiver module supply chain companies indicates rapidly increasing cluster sizes, which could benefit the chipmaker ahead of the calendar year 2025.\n\nSeparately, UBS analysts said they see upside to Nvidi’a July print, anticipating continued strength from the data center segment, which could reach as high as $26 billion, above the Street’s estimate of $25 billion.\n\nKey bullish indicators include strong results from SMCI driven by Hopper demand, significant quarter-over-quarter growth in high-performance computing for TSMC, robust results in KYEC's data processing segment, and strong AI server sales from Quanta Computer.\n\nHowever, Taiwan's data processing export data suggests a lower figure, though analysts note this data's historical variability and its exclusion of critical Nvidia revenue streams like H20 ramping in China and networking.\n\nFor guidance, UBS expects strong demand for Hopper and H200 to drive Nvidia to guide toward $31-32 billion, with an implied data center revenue close to $28 billion.\n\n“We believe investor bogeys are already in this range (Street revenue is ~$31.5B) which optically doesn't create a great setup, but we believe Blackwell commentary will overshadow wherever guidance comes out as investors are already looking to the BW ramp in 2025, and we believe NVDA will generally communicate that BW is \"on track\",” said UBS analysts.\n\nThe main concern is how Nvidia will address its previous statement about expecting \"significant\" Blackwell revenue this year, which analysts believe was unrealistic given that customer volume shipments were initially set for mid-December and have now been delayed by 4-6 weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings preview: Blackwell commentary to overshadow guidance numbers\n\nFactbox-Airlines suspend flights as Middle East tensions rise\n\nAlaska Air, Hawaiian deal advances as DOJ ends antitrust review\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Artisan Partners, an investment management company, released its “Artisan Select Equity Fund” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.4% compared to a 4.28% return for the S&P 500 Index and a -2.2% return for the Russell 1000 Value Index. Year-to-date the fund increased 10.4% compared to 15.3% and 6.6% return for the indexes. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 5.23%, and its shares gained 176.79% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 19, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $130.00 per share with a market capitalization of $3.198 trillion.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"What’s more, returns are increasingly concentrated in just a few names. Four companies—NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft— generated essentially all of the MSCI ACWI Index’s and S&P 500® Index’s Q2 return. NVIDIA represented nearly 40% of the total return for the MSCI ACWI Index and 44% of the total return for the S&P 500® Index. Said another way, excluding NVIDIA from these indices would have reduced the benchmark’s return by nearly half.\n\nLest this increase in NVIDIA appear too abstract, consider this. NVIDIA’s year-to-date dollar value increase is $1.8 trillion. That’s equivalent to the 2023 increase in US GDP, which is, of course, representative of the collective economic efforts of about 330 million people. NVIDIA’s market cap is now $3 trillion.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Next Big Move",
        "content": "By now you probably know that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the hottest stock in tech. The company's rapid ascent from gaming chipmaker to poster child of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution and one of the largest public companies in the world has been nothing short of remarkable.\n\nAfter its stock nearly tripled since the beginning of the year, it retreated about 8% from its peak in June. Fear not. I think it's still got a lot of room to run. If anything, this is a buying opportunity.\n\nNvidia is in a good position\n\nNvidia's incredible revenue growth is being driven largely by a handful of companies like Amazon and Microsoft that operate \"hyperscale\" data centers (or \"hyperscalers\") -- really, really, really big server farms. The companies are upgrading and expanding them in order to keep up with the massive and specialized computing resources demanded by AI. Nvidia's superchips power them. Yes, there are other players, but Nvidia dominates the market.\n\nThe good news for Nvidia? This firehose of cash doesn't seem likely to be shut off any time soon. During recent earnings calls, CEOs from the companies that run these hyperscalers reiterated the need to continue -- and even expand -- AI-focused capital expenditures (capex). Alphabet spent roughly $31 billion on capex in 2023. This year, that figure could reach $50 billion -- a colossal increase. And Alphabet isn't alone.\n\nAlphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, summed up big tech's attitude toward these investments like this: \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" This messaging was echoed by almost every CEO leading a hyperscaler. Nvidia is likely to enjoy substantial cash inflows for the foreseeable future. Of course, it will need to fend off competitors, but it is well positioned to do so.\n\nNow, that's business as usual. What's Nvidia's next big move?\n\nSpotlight on networking\n\nData centers are incredibly complex, especially those built for AI. At the heart of these systems are the chips that perform the computations. This is the market Nvidia dominates. However, all this high-powered computing creates massive amounts of data, and that data needs to be transported. This is where networking infrastructure comes in.\n\nThe standard for networking in most data centers has been ethernet, but the demands of AI computing are too great for the technology. Companies needed to retrofit their data centers with a different networking technology like InfiniBand to keep up. This is extremely costly, but Nvidia has an answer. It recently released its Spectrum-X platform, which allows data centers to remain ethernet-based and run advanced AI. This represents a large new revenue stream for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, Nvidia made close to $20 billion from its chips and $3 billion for its networking products. Mordor Intelligence estimates that the total market for data center networking infrastructure is about $26 billion in 2024 and it forecasts the space to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2029. There is significant room to grow in this arena.\n\nThere is competition, however. Broadcom is already a major player. Nvidia is unlikely to dominate this space as it has with the chip market. However, this new ethernet-based approach could be a game changer. A bigger share of the market is very possible.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Weiner could challenge Pelosi’s daughter Christine Pelosi, who is also widely expected to run for her mother’s seat, according to a New York Post report.\n\nWeiner disagreed with Pelosi’s comments and issued a rebuttal.\n\n“Innovation and safety are not mutually exclusive, and I reject the false claim that in order to innovate, we must leave safety solely in the hands of technology companies and venture capitalists,” Weiner said.\n\nPelosi is an investor in several companies exposed to the artificial intelligence sector.\n\nOne of her largest disclosed positions is in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), a semiconductor company benefiting from growth of the AI sector.\n\nPelosi disclosed buying 10,000 NVDA shares in June and another 10,000 shares in July. The Pelosis also previously bought NVDA calls in 2023 and had a prior position in the company that was sold due to investor pressure over the timing of the trade related to the CHIPS Act.\n\nDisclosures also show Pelosi owning stakes in Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), companies that could benefit from AI growth.\n\nPelosi also disclosed a $1 million to $5 million investment in privately owned Databricks, an analytics and AI company.\n\nThe battle for regulation of the AI industry comes with constant pushback as the U.S. wants to be a leader and see its companies profit, but also seeks to protect consumers and the future of the industry.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100. \r\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article Nancy Pelosi Criticizes California AI Regulation As 'Well-Intentioned But Ill-Informed': Would Bill Hurt Her Tech Investments? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "If You Bought 1 Share of Nvidia Stock at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now",
        "content": "One can't compile a list of history's most successful stocks without including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in 1999, the stock has risen nearly 300,000%! The majority of that gain occurred over the last 10 years as the advent of cloud computing increased the importance of Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nHowever, what truly supercharged the stock was the company's dominance in AI chips. The demand for such chips has made Nvidia the leading chip company, leading to a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this year. When combining that with previous splits, even Nvidia's smallest shareholders would own a significant position today.\n\nNvidia's share growth\n\nInvestors who bought one share of Nvidia stock at the IPO would have 480 shares today. The company's stock has split 2-for-1 three times between 2000 and 2006 and 3-for-2 in 2007. No other splits occurred until the pandemic, when demand for Nvidia's GPUs took shares higher, prompting a 4-for-1 split. The AI chip revolution led shares to a massive surge between late 2022 and today, leading to the aforementioned 10-for-1 split.\n\nThe financial gains were huge. One share at the IPO cost $12 before the six splits. Today, 480 shares hold a value of around $58,000. Thus, even holding a token amount of Nvidia in 1999 would have brought eye-popping returns.\n\nPutting Nvidia's growth in perspective\n\nUltimately, Nvidia shows how holding even one share can bring considerable share growth through splits.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect one share of their growth stocks to become 480 shares. Nonetheless, if a company consistently grows revenue and profits by double digits, it's likely to split every few years.\n\nIt takes only seven 2-for-1 splits for one share to grow to 128 shares, or just two 10-for-1 splits to turn one share into 100. Such examples show how investing in a successful growth stock early on can lead to exponential share gains over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): This AI Stock Is Trending Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\n\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. The stock has been hit recently amid a broader selloff in the tech sector and reports of delays in the production of new AI chips branded Blackwell. However, the bigger picture remains rosy. The company has taken measures to ease investor concerns on the new chip, AI labs of the firm have been upsizing and lengthening their instance commitments, and enterprises are rapidly growing as a proportion of the demand mix. All these indicators point towards a bullish outlook for the AI giant.\n\nAnalysts led by Timothy Arcuri at investment advisory UBS have also recently backed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to emerge from the Blackwell troubles unscathed, reiterating a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $150. Arcuri and his team noted that initial Blackwell customer volume shipments were only delayed four to six weeks at most, putting them at the very end of January 2025. This delay, per the team, was likely to be filled in large by customers taking more H200 chips due to very short lead times.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Time to Buy AMD's Stock After Announcing $4.9 Billion Acquisition of ZT Systems?",
        "content": "AMD’s AMD stock was up +3% in this morning's trading session after announcing plans to acquire private technology firm ZT Systems for $4.9 billion.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in early 2025 and should help AMD compete against Nvidia NVDA regarding its artificial intelligence portfolio. To that point, ZT Systems specializes in data center infrastructure which has become critical to the AI ecosystem with Nvidia being the market leader.\n\nZT Systems Overview\n\nFounded in 1994, ZT Systems is a New Jersey-based company that engineers and manufactures compute and storage solutions for hyperscale cloud computing and internet infrastructure providers.\n\nZT Systems’ specialties also extend to AI and machine-to-machine transactions with the company generating $10 billion in revenue last year. Notably, AMD CEO Lisa Su believes the addition of engineers from ZT Systems will allow AMD to quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft MSFT require.\n\nMonitoring AMD’s Balance Sheet\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition in cash which should roughly amount to $3.67 billion. Considering such, It’s noteworthy that AMDcurrently has $5.34 billion in cash and will complete the remainder of the ZT Systems purchase in stock offerings. Furthermore, AMD has $67.88 billion in total assets which is nicely above its $11.34 billion in total liabilities. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD’s Growth Trajectory\n\nStriving to expand its reach as a chip leader, AMD’s total sales are now projected to be up 12% in fiscal 2024 and are expected to climb another 26% in FY25 to $32.18 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnnual earnings are forecasted to jump 26% this year to $3.35 per share versus EPS of $2.65 in 2023. Even better, FY25 EPS is projected to climb another 54% to $5.17. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD Performance Comparison\n\nDespite its attractive growth trajectory, AMD shares are only up +3% this year thanks to today’s spike which has extended a recent rally over the last week. With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq up just over +15% in 2024, AMD has largely lagged Nvidia’s stock as well which has skyrocketed more than +150%.\n\nStill, AMD is sitting on +64% gains in the last two years which has topped the broader indexes but widely trails Nvidia’s +643%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD Valuation Comparison\n\nAt current levels, AMD trades at 44.3X forward earnings and at a premium to the S&P 500’s 23.4X. That said, AMD trades near Nvidia’s 46.3X and its Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors Industry average of 42.5X.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore intriguing is that AMD trades well below its five-year high of 107.2X forward earnings and at a discount to the median of 52.4X during this period.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAMD’s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although AMD’s YTD performance has lagged the broader market while also trading at a premium, its growth trajectory does suggest more upside.\n\nIt’s very plausible that long-term investors will be rewarded seeing as AMD has a strong balance sheet and the acquisition of ZT Systems could significantly boost its top line and AI data center expansion.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 16 most profitable industries in the US in 2024. You can skip our detailed discussion and go directly to 5 Most Profitable Industries in the US in 2024.\n\nAn Outlook of the US Economy & its Impact on Business\n\nOnly recently markets in the United States witnessed unprecedented downturns amid fears over a possible recession. The unemployment rate in the United States reached 4% in May, the highest in over two years. On August 2, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate in the United States grew to 4.3% in July, adding only 114,000 jobs during the month. Temporary layoffs in the United States reached 1.1 million in July and the head count for long-term unemployed individuals was 1.5 million. As the unemployment rate in the US continues to rise, the risk of an impending recession looms over the economy deterring investor confidence.\n\nThe fears of a declining economy were aggravated as probable rate cuts by the Fed were delayed to the last quarter of 2024. On August 16, Reuters reported that the Fed is expected to deliver a rate cut next month in September. Experts predict that the rate cut will ease inflationary pressures. As per the rate cut expectations, consensus opinions hint towards a quarter to half-point cut, and a 30 basis point cut in the future. While the US economy is not officially in a recession, the quarterly real GDP growth expectation collapsed to 1.5% from over 4% in May, as of July 5, according to Reuters.\n\nThe impact of uncertain macroeconomic conditions on consumer spending and business outlook has been immense. On May 30, Reuters reported that the US economy experienced sluggish growth in the first quarter, unable to meet expectations. Between January and March, GDP expanded by only 1.3%, down from the previously estimated 1.6%. The report suggests that high interest rates to cool the economy have led to declines in consumer spending, which were revised down to an annualized rate of 2%. Corporate profits declined by 0.6%, after reaching a record high in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\n10 Best Blue Chip Stocks Under $100 and\n\n7 Best Canadian Stocks Under $20.\n\nThe Company Driving the Most Profitable Industries\n\nDespite macroeconomic challenges, some industries have been performing immensely well. The software applications and semiconductor industries are some of the most profitable industries in the United States. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) calls itself the “Engine of AI” as it pioneers the hardware and software for AI, such as semiconductors and AI applications. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) not only designs and produces graphics processing units (GPUs), but it also provides cloud products to enterprises.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company currently holds a 95% market share of data center GPUs and 80% of the market share of AI accelerators. It reported $22.6 billion in data center revenue in Q1 2024, up by 23% from the previous quarter and 427% from a year ago. Compute and networking revenue drove data center revenue, growing by 5x and 3x than the previous year.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding its footprint in the AI and robotics industry by forming strategic partnerships with other tech giants. In the first quarter of 2024, the company launched optimizations across NVIDIA’s data center in collaboration with Google. Figure, a robotics startup, trained on Nvidia's GPUs, announced the launch of its next-generation humanoid robot on August 8. The new robot has ultimate computing power, allowing it to perform human tasks autonomously.\n\nOverall, NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) role in harnessing technology is crucial to the US economy. Currently, the company provides chips to 95% of the market and is in the works of launching a new batch that also runs the company's software infrastructure. Now transformed into an AI company, Nvidia is powering through to add another $15 trillion to the US economy.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some cheaper AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nNow that we have studied the US economy, let's take a look at the 16 most profitable industries in the United States in 2024.

We used average industry net margins that have been calculated for the year 2024 across multiple companies. Our list is in ascending order of the industry net margins in 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

        "title": "Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Before Q2 Earnings: To Buy or Not to Buy?",
        "content": "Snowflake SNOW is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 21.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $848.15 million, indicating an increase of 25.83% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings has been stable in the past 30 days at 15 cents per share. The figure suggests a decrease of 31.82% from the year-ago quarter’s levels.\r\n\r\nSNOW’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 74.84%.\r\n\r\nLet’s see how things have shaped up for SNOW prior to this announcement.\n\nSnowflake Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nSnowflake Inc. price-eps-surprise | Snowflake Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Note\n\nSNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt customer spending patterns. \r\n\r\nIncreased GPU-related costs as Snowflake aggressively invests in AI initiatives are expected to have kept margins under pressure. Moreover, stiff competition from the likes of Databricks and increasing pricing pressure.\r\n\r\nHowever, SNOW’s top-line growth is expected to have benefited from a strong portfolio with new capabilities, including Marketplace Listing Auto-Fulfillment & Monetization, account replication & failover, Query Acceleration Service, geospatial analytics and Snowpipe Streaming.\n\nSNOW Shares Underperform Sector, S&P 500\n\nSnowflake shares have declined 35.7%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 20.8% and the S&P 500’s 16.5%.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Chart Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSNOW stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nThe stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 10.96X compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 6.36X.\n\nP/S Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExpanding Portfolio Aids Long-term Prospects\n\nSNOW has introduced capabilities including Marketplace Listing Auto-Fulfillment & Monetization, account replication & failover, Query Acceleration Service, geospatial analytics and Snowpipe Streaming. \r\n\r\nIceberg tables, Hybrid tables, and Cortex Large Language Model (LLM) and machine learning-powered functions became available in public preview. These capabilities are expected to become generally available in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Snowflake announced Arctic, its own LLM.\r\n\r\nSnowflake’s Polaris Catalog is a vendor-neutral, open catalog implementation for Apache Iceberg, which is the open standard of choice for implementing data lakehouses, data lakes and other modern architectures.\r\n\r\nThe Polaris Catalog offers enterprises and the entire Iceberg community new levels of choice, flexibility and control over their data, with full enterprise security. It offers Apache Iceberg interoperability with Amazon’s AMZN cloud division Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Confluent, Dremio, Google Cloud, Microsoft MSFT Azure, Salesforce and more.\r\n\r\nSNOW is hosting META’s Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual open-source LLMs in Snowflake Cortex AI for enterprises to easily harness and build powerful AI applications at scale. It has added new innovations and enhancements to Snowflake Cortex AI that unlock the next wave of enterprise AI for customers with easy, efficient and trusted ways to create AI-powered applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Partner Base: A Key Catalyst\n\nSNOW is benefiting from an expanding partner base that includes Amazon, Microsoft, META, NVIDIA NVDA, Fiserv, EY, Deloitte, LTIMindtree, Next Pathway and S&P Global, among others.\r\n\r\nIts collaboration with NVIDIA will help customers and partners build customized AI data applications in its platform powered by NVIDIA AI. \r\n\r\nSnowflake has adopted NVIDIA AI Enterprise software to integrate NeMo Retriever microservices into Snowflake Cortex AI, its fully managed LLM and vector search service. The integration will help enterprises to smoothly connect custom models to diverse business data and deliver highly accurate responses.\r\n\r\nSnowflake and Microsoft recently announced an expanded partnership that plans to offer an interoperability experience between Snowflake and Microsoft Fabric OneLake. The interoperability is possible due to their support for the industry’s leading open standards for analytical storage formats, Apache Iceberg and Apache Parquet.\r\n\r\nSnowflake also announced Snowflake Data Clean Rooms to customers in AWS East, AWS West and Azure West. SNOW leveraged its acquisition of data clean room technology provider Samooha to launch the solution.\n\nConclusion\n\nSnowflake is a risky bet in the near term, given its modest growth prospect and a stretched valuation.\r\n\r\nSNOW’s margins are expected to suffer from higher costs, a challenging macroeconomic environment and stiff competition.\r\n\r\nSnowflake currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for more favorable entry points in the stock. However, investors who already own the stock might expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over a longer term.

        "content": "Markets edged higher on Monday after posting their best week of the year as traders await an update on monetary policy with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell set to speak at Jackson Hole on Friday.\n\nIn the meantime, headlines Monday morning have three key stocks — AMD, Palantir, and fuboTV on the move:\n\nAMD (AMD): Shares of the the chipmaker rose about 2% early Monday after the company announced plans to acquire hyperscale solutions provider ZT Systems in a deal valued at $4.9 billion.\n\nAMD said ZT Systems, which provides artificial intelligence (AI) and general compute infrastructure, will help it \"deliver leadership AI training and inferencing solutions\" and will also help \"cloud and enterprise customers significantly accelerate the deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale.\"\n\nThe deal comes as AMD looks to broaden its AI infrastructure in order to compete with market leader Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of AMD are up just over 2% since the start of the year while Nvidia shares have soared about 150%. Nvidia will report second quarter earnings next week.\n\nPalantir (PLTR): Data analytics company Palantir was in the spotlight on Monday after co-founder and CEO Alex Karp participated in an in-depth New York Times profile. In the interview, Karp, who largely stays out of the spotlight, defended his military partnerships, discussed his political views, and laid out the origin story of Palantir, along with his relationship with co-founder Peter Thiel.\n\nPalantir has faced recent criticism over its work with the military and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Notably, the company does not do business with China, Russia, or other countries that are outwardly against Western ideologies. Joshua Kushner, founder of Thrive Capital and Alex Karp, chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc., attend the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 11, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) (Kevork Djansezian via Getty Images)\n\n\"If you believe we should appease Iran, Russia and China by saying we’re going to be nicer and nicer and nicer, of course you’ll look at Palantir negatively. Some of these places want you to do the apology show for what you believe in, and we don’t apologize for what we believe in,\" Karp said. \"I’m not going to apologize for defending the US government on the border, defending the Special Ops, bringing the people home. I’m not apologizing for giving our product to Ukraine or Israel or lots of other places.”\n\nPalantir shares hugged the flatline on Monday but have climbed more than 85% since the start of the year.\n\nfuboTV (FUBO): Shares of sports streamer fuboTV rallied another 30% on Monday following a Friday ruling which temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA).\n\nStory continues\n\nUS District Judge Margaret Garnett determined in her ruling that the launch of the joint venture would \"substantially lessen competition and restrain trade.\" Furthermore, it would also ensure \"a swift exodus of large numbers of Fubo’s subscribers\" and that \"Fubo’s bankruptcy and delisting of the company’s stock will likely soon follow. These are quintessential harms that money cannot adequately repair.\"\n\nThe preliminary injunction comes after fuboTV filed a lawsuit against the media giants behind the joint venture in February, seeking to block the service. At the time, fubo cited \"the extreme suppression of competition in the US sports-focused streaming market.\"\n\nDisney, Warner Bros., and Fox said they will be appealing the ruling. Shares of those companies were little changed on the news. Year to date, fuboTV stock is still down about 40%.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - AMD on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.\n\n\"AI systems are our number one strategic priority,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.\n\n\"The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,\" Su said.\n\nAMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.\n\nAMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.\n\nZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD's data center chief, Forrest Norrod.\n\nThe closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.\n\nExecutives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company's developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware.\n\nSu said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company's customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nAMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company's adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "title": "Want to Get Richer? 3 Top Stocks to Buy During a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "With volatility returning to the stock market in recent days, patient investors may soon have an opportunity to scoop up shares of some outstanding companies at a discount. Here are three elite stocks to place near the top of your buy list.\n\nCostco Wholesale\n\nConsumers love to buy quality merchandise at bargain prices. Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) has long made masterful use of this simple yet difficult-to-replicate formula to the benefit of its members and shareholders alike.\n\nWith over $250 billion in annual revenue, Costco's massive scale allows it to offer a curated selection of goods at prices its competitors find challenging to match. These ultra-low prices entice people to purchase Costco memberships and remain loyal customers. They also enable the discount retailer to raise its membership fees from time to time, which helps to boost its bottom line.\n\nThese membership fees, in turn, are fueling Costco's earnings growth. The discount retail leader passes these profits on to its shareowners via steadily growing quarterly cash dividends, as well as occasional special dividends. Store count expansion, combined with rising sales at existing locations, should continue to drive Costco's profits higher in the coming years.\n\nVisa\n\nA steadily increasing number of transactions at Costco and other retailers are being completed via digital channels. As the operator of the largest debit and credit card networks, Visa(NYSE: V) is well-placed to cash in on this powerful global trend.\n\nVisa's scale is breathtaking. Its 14,500 banking partners have issued more than 4.5 billion payment cards in over 200 countries and territories, which are accepted at over 130 million merchant locations. Visa, in turn, processed an astounding 297 billion transactions totaling $15.5 trillion during the 12 months ended June 30.\n\nVisa charges relatively small fees for its payment processing services. Yet, when combined with the payment giant's other business lines, these fees collectively amounted to a whopping $4.9 billion in net income in the third quarter alone. Visa's impressive profitability has enabled it to reward its investors with 16 straight years of dividend raises -- a streak that's likely to extend well into the next decade and beyond.\n\nNvidia\n\nLike the global shift from cash to digital forms of payment, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is set to create lucrative opportunities for shrewd investors. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is profiting from the AI gold rush more than any other company, and more good times lie ahead for its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe semiconductor titan's cutting-edge chips power the most advanced AI applications. Tech powerhouses like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla rely on Nvidia's hardware to accelerate their AI workloads in their massive cloud data centers.\n\nWith the AI arms race heating up, demand for Nvidia's industry-leading computing products is soaring. The chipmaker's sales surged by 262% year over year to $26 billion in the quarter ended April 28. Its net income, in turn, increased by a stunning 628% to $15 billion.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang believes that $1 trillion worth of data center hardware will eventually be replaced by accelerated computing platforms. With so much growth still ahead, investors who buy Nvidia's shares today should be well rewarded.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $763,374!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "AMD to Acquire Server Maker ZT Systems in $4.9 Billion Deal",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. agreed to buy server maker ZT Systems in a cash and stock transaction valued at $4.9 billion, adding data center technology that will bolster its efforts to challenge Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival ‘Train Lovers’ Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid Manchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk\n\nZT Systems, based in Secaucus, New Jersey, will become part of AMD’s Data Center Solutions Business Group, according to a statement Monday. AMD will retain the business’s design and customer teams and look to sell the manufacturing division. The deal price includes a contingent payment of $400 million based on certain milestones.\n\nClosely held ZT has extensive experience making server computers for owners of large data centers — the kind of customers that are pouring billions into new artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nThe acquisition will “significantly strengthen our data center AI systems,” AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said in the statement.\n\nThe company has its sights set on Nvidia, the runaway leader in the market for data center gear needed to support AI computing. AMD is adding software and hardware capabilities that will better match the breadth of Nvidia’s offerings and speed the uptake of its chips.\n\nAMD is the second-biggest provider of the graphics processors that have become so vital to developing AI software. And it’s spent more than $1 billion in the last 12 months to expand its reach in that market. In July, the company agreed to buy Silo AI for $665 million to add a maker of artificial intelligence models.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based AMD is seen as Nvidia’s closest rival in AI processors. Its new MI range of accelerator chips will bring in more than $4.5 billion of new revenue this year, the company has projected. That puts it ahead of all other challengers to Nvidia, but still way behind. Analysts expect Nvidia to generate $100 billion in data center revenue this fiscal year.\n\nPart of Nvidia’s expansion has been fueled by offering chips, networking, servers, software and services, all aimed at making AI use more pervasive in the economy. Under Su’s leadership, AMD is showing a commitment to match that reach.\n\nAMD shares rose less than 1% in New York trading on Friday, leaving the stock little changed in 2024. But gains over recent years have pushed its market value to $240 billion, more than twice that of longtime rival Intel Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSingapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem Inside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Next Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chipmaker Stock to Join Nvidia in the Trillion-Dollar Club (Hint: It's Not Broadcom)",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its share price soar on the back of huge artificial intelligence (AI)-related spending from big tech companies. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential infrastructure for training large language models, the backbone of generative AI. As more and more companies invest in the frontier of AI development, Nvidia has been a big beneficiary.\n\nThe chipmaker joined the $1 trillion club last summer and passed a $2 trillion valuation in February. After a brief foray into the $3 trillion territory, the stock sits just below that threshold as of this writing.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker riding the tidal wave of AI spending. Several others have seen big boosts to their business as a result of the requisite data center build-outs, including Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Broadcom's networking and AI accelerator chips have proven increasingly valuable as data centers rapidly expand. Both help big tech companies get the most from their investments and have propelled the chipmaker to a $750 billion valuation.\n\nThe next semiconductor stock to join Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club won't be Broadcom, though. Investors should look up the supply chain to find the next chipmaker to exceed a $1 trillion valuation: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis company wins when chipmakers compete\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the largest chip fabricator in the world. It accounts for roughly 60% of all foundry spending, and there's a good reason: It has the most advanced chip manufacturing processes in the world. That allows it to make more powerful and power-efficient chips for its customers. Both areas are extremely important for AI and other areas, such as smartphones.\n\nImportantly, it's unlikely TSMC's next-closest competitor will be able to unseat the company from its position. TSMC's scale is a massive advantage. With so much revenue coming in, it's able to invest more in research and development. That ensures it remains at the leading edge of manufacturing processes.\n\nBig customers, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and others contract with TSMC to produce the chips they design for sale and for use in their products. Almost anyone who wants to compete with those companies likely contracts with TSMC as well. So, even if Nvidia or Broadcom start losing market share to a competitor, TSMC is unlikely to lose business overall. In fact, competition for TSMC's limited resources is great for its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's seen in its most recent financial reporting. TSMC set a new monthly revenue record in July when it brought in 257 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$8 billion). That's a 45% year-over-year increase for the month. Last quarter, the company saw revenue grow 40% (33% in USD) and net income grow 36%. Two-thirds of its revenue came from its most advanced chip processes.\n\nThere's a lot more growth in the pipeline\n\nTSMC should continue to benefit from several catalysts over the next few years. That starts with management's outlook for the third quarter.\n\nIt expects $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, and it's already ahead of pace with its July sales. At its midpoint, the outlook represents 32% year-over-year growth. Moreover, it expects gross margin to expand to between 53.5% and 55.5%. That suggests the company is exhibiting pricing power amid growing customer demand.\n\nThat demand should keep growing as big tech companies share plans to spend heavily on AI server capacity. Meta Platforms said it expects significant capital expenditures (capex) growth in 2025, even as it sets new records for capex this year. Likewise, Alphabet's management said the cost of overspending is far less than the cost of under-investing in AI, so investors should expect considerable capital investments there as well. Similar sentiments are echoed throughout the tech space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMany investors are expecting strong results from the next Apple iPhone release, which will include support for new Apple AI features. Many existing iPhone users will be unable to use the latest AI capabilities offered by Apple due to hardware restrictions, which could spur a significant round of upgrades over the next year. Strong iPhone demand will mean strong demand for TSMC's chips.\n\nTSMC is preparing for the increased demand. It narrowed its capex forecast for the year to between $30 billion and $32 billion, increasing the low end from $28 billion. The increased spending outlook came with this comment from management: \"At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with the higher growth opportunities in the following years.\"\n\nThe stock has room to rise\n\nDespite TSMC's $875 billion market cap, the stock looks undervalued at today's price. Shares currently trade for a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.5. Meanwhile, strong revenue growth and margin expansion can support earnings growth above 20% per year for the foreseeable future. Analysts currently expect 21.5% earnings growth per year over the next five years.\n\nThat makes TSMC one of the most attractive AI chipmaker stocks on the market. It currently sits about 14% away from the trillion-dollar club, so it shouldn't be long before it reaches the milestone.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Is Buying This Under-The-Radar Tech Stock",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPaul Singer of Elliott Management\n\nWestern Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nPaul Singer owns an $89.7 million stake in Western Digital via Elliott Management as of the end of the June quarter.\n\nWestern Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) is one of the top semiconductor picks of  Cantor Fitzgerald. The company recently reported quarterly results. Cloud segment revenue jumped 20% on a sequential basis. Overall, the company is seeing a rise in profits amid higher pricing and a shift to premium high-performance products. The cloud business, particularly in high-capacity HDDs for data centers, remains strong.\n\nWhat are AI-related growth catalysts for Western Digital? How can an SSD and storage devices company be called an AI stock?\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence and its data demands positively impact both HDD and flash demand. Generative AI apps and machine learning require substantial data storage, a tailwind for Western Digital. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, which is still in its early stages.\n\nDuring the fiscal Q3 earnings call the company’s management talked about AI-related business trends:\n\n“I would say about the AI demand as it’s coming into focus. I don’t think it’s so much in the results just yet, but we’re seeing where it’s going to impact both businesses. And clearly, one of them you just outlined, which is we’re seeing enterprise SSD demand return, we saw some increase in the last quarter. We expect some increase in this quarter. But really, as we look to the second half, we have customers coming to us wanting the kind of SSDs we built and qualified before the downturn. They just want them in much bigger capacity points, 30 and 60 terabyte capacity points. So it’s the same product just taking it and increasing capacity and going through a qualification on that so we’re in that process with customers.\n\nWe also introduced a new SSD that’s more compute focused, which is PCIe Gen 5 product based on BiCS 6, very high performance that plays a little bit different role in the AI training stack and we’re getting very good feedback on that product. It’s being qualified by our starting qualification, we samples. We’re kind of getting rid of the qualification of the hyperscaler and we’re seeing good demand in the enterprise market as well. So we feel like the portfolio set up well as we go into the second half, and we’re seeing a lot of demand show up for people that are very building large amount of infrastructure for model training.”\n\nOverall Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WDC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 High-Flying Stock-Split Stocks Prominent Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They're Buying Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Despite all the attention artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered on Wall Street, it's stock-split euphoria that's been giving AI a run for its money in 2024.\n\nA stock split marks an event that allows publicly traded companies to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that adjusting a company's share price and share count by the same magnitude has no impact on its market cap, and doesn't affect its underlying operating performance.\n\nSplits comes in two varieties, with investors favoring one far more than the other. Reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price, usually with the goal of ensuring continued listing on a major stock exchange. Meanwhile, forward-stock splits reduce a company's nominal share price. The purpose of forward splits is to make shares more \"affordable\" for investors who lack access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince forward-stock splits are being conducted by high-flying companies that are almost always out-executing and out-innovating their peers, this is the type of split that investors favor.\n\nOver the last six months, 13 high-profile companies have announced or completed a stock split, all but one of which is of the forward-split variety:\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT): 3-for-1 forward split Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 10-for-1 forward split Amphenol(NYSE: APH): 2-for-1 forward split Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG): 50-for-1 forward split Mitsui(OTC: MITSY)(OTC: MITSF): 2-for-1 forward split Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM): 2-for-1 forward split Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO): 10-for-1 forward split MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR): 10-for-1 forward split Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS): 4-for-1 forward split Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI): 1-for-10 reverse split Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI): 10-for-1 forward split Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX): 10-for-1 forward split Sony Group(NYSE: SONY): 5-for-1 forward split\n\nEven though stock-split stocks have, since 1980, vastly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 with regard to average annual return in the 12 months following their initial split announcement, billionaire money managers have mixed feelings about this bunch.\n\nBased on the latest round of Form 13F filings -- these filings tell investors what prominent money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter -- two of these stock-split stocks were sent to the chopping block by billionaire investors, while shares of another were scooped up hand over fist.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 top-tier billionaires are sending to the chopping block: Nvidia\n\nThe first stock-split stock that billionaire money managers have been actively showing to the door is the hardware kingpin of the AI revolution, Nvidia. The June-ended quarter represents the third consecutive quarter of significant selling activity by asset managers, with seven billionaires reducing their respective fund's stakes (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nAlthough profit-taking may be playing a key role in this ongoing selling activity -- shares of Nvidia have increased by more than 700% since 2023 began -- it's just as likely that billionaire money managers are becoming concerned about competitive pressures and the role history has played with next-big-thing innovations.\n\nDespite Nvidia maintaining a clear compute advantage with its graphics processing units (GPUs), compute advantage alone may not be enough to avoid losing market share and precious pricing power on its GPUs. With demand overwhelming supply, and Nvidia's production partially stymied by the capacity of its suppliers and design flaws for its next-gen Blackwell platform, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices should have no trouble finding buyers for its chips.\n\nI'll also add that all four of Nvidia's top customers, representing roughly 40% of its net sales, are internally developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. These complementary chips all but ensure reduced reliance on Nvidia's hardware in future years.\n\nHowever, history might be the most damning concern of all. Every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years has endured a bubble-bursting event. Investors always overestimate the uptake and utility of new technologies, leading to eventual disappointment. When the euphoria surrounding AI fades, Nvidia's stock will likely be clobbered. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 successful billionaire asset managers are selling: Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe second high-flying stock-split stock that billionaire investors dumped in droves during the second quarter is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill. A trio of billionaires were sellers, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (8,764,412 shares) Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management (8,384,035 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (614,200 shares)\n\nThe noteworthy name here is Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, who's been a longtime holder of Chipotle's stock (since the third quarter of 2016).\n\nIn many ways, Chipotle has been firing on all cylinders. The company's use of responsibly raised meats and locally sourced vegetables (when possible) have resonated with consumers who desire higher-quality, non-frozen foods, and afforded Chipotle ample pricing power.\n\nAdditionally, the company's management team has remained disciplined in its approach to growth. By continuing to limit the size of the company's menu, Chipotle's staff is able to quickly prep food each day, as well as expedite lines in its restaurants.\n\nSo, why sell? The likeliest reason this trio of billionaires reduced their respective stakes has to do with Chipotle Mexican Grill's valuation. Although comparable restaurant sales growth of 7% in the first quarter and 11.1% in the second quarter is impressive for a chain the size of Chipotle, it doesn't quite justify a forward-earnings multiple of 40. There's only so much innovation that can be squeezed out of restaurant chains.\n\nWe also recently learned that Brian Niccol would depart as Chairman and CEO, effective Aug. 31, and slide into his new role as the CEO of coffee chain Starbucks. Given how successful Chipotle Mexican Grill has been since Niccol's arrival in March 2018, there's liable to be concern about the company's ability to innovate and execute going forward.\n\nThe stock-split stock prominent billionaire investors are buying hand over fist: Broadcom\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the one Class of 2024 stock-split stock that a half-dozen billionaire investors couldn't stop buying during the June-ended quarter. I'm talking about AI networking solutions specialist Broadcom (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,930,970 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (2,096,440 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,880,740 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (1,332,230 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (865,090 shares)\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, Broadcom's sails have been lifted by otherworldly demand for AI networking solutions. For instance, the company's Jericho3-AI fabric can connect up to 32,000 GPUs in high-compute data centers, thereby limiting tail latency and maximizing the compute ability of GPUs.\n\nWhile this does mean Broadcom would have exposure to an AI bubble-bursting event, its sales channels are considerably more diverse than Nvidia.\n\nAs an example, Broadcom is one of the world's leading providers of wireless chips used in next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies spending big bucks to upgrade their networks to support 5G download speeds have led to sizable demand for next-generation wireless solutions amid a steady device replacement cycle.\n\nBroadcom has also not been shy about using inorganic means to diversify its revenue stream. It acquired cybersecurity company Symantec in 2019, and more recently scooped up virtualization and cloud-computing software company VMware. The latter is to support Broadcom's efforts to be a major player in private and hybrid enterprise clouds.\n\nLong story short, Broadcom is better positioned than most AI companies to navigate a bubble-bursting event, should one occur.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings preview: Goldman reiterates Buy on solid AI infrastructure demand",
        "content": "Wall Street anticipates another strong quarter for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as investors’ favorite chipmaker prepares to release its fiscal Q2 2025 results on August 28. The company’s high-end graphics processing chips, which are the benchmark for running generative AI workloads, continue to see robust demand, setting the stage for a solid performance.\n\nAlthough there have been reports of a delay in the Blackwell chip, which could cause some near-term volatility in Nvidia’s fundamentals, Nvidia’s management commentary and supply-chain data in the coming weeks may reinforce confidence in the company’s earnings potential for calendar year 2025, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\n\nThey believe that the market is likely to overlook any negative impacts from a shift in the Blackwell ramp's timing, projecting robust sequential growth in Nvidia’s Data Center revenue. This growth is expected to be driven by strong demand for Hopper-based GPUs, early shipments of Blackwell products, and expansion in Nvidia’s Networking business, even if there are transitory headwinds related to Blackwell.\n\nThe analysts also note that customer demand remains strong among large cloud service providers and enterprises, with Nvidia maintaining a solid competitive position in AI and accelerated computing.\n\nThey highlight several supportive indicators, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) improved outlook for AI demand, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD)'s increase in its full-year Data Center GPU revenue outlook, and positive comments from major U.S. hyperscalers about their plans to expand AI infrastructure investments.\n\nMoreover, Taiwanese original design manufacturers (ODMs) and companies like Hon Hai have reported better-than-expected revenues, reinforcing the view that demand for AI servers is strong. AI server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) also exceeded expectations with its recent earnings and provided strong guidance, driven by demand for its Direct Liquid Cooling solutions from AI-focused cloud service providers.\n\nThe analysts further mention that U.S.-based hyperscalers, which account for more than 50% of Nvidia’s Data Center revenue, have continued to express optimism about Nvidia's future.\n\nSome customers have offered early evidence of how generative AI is already benefiting industries like advertising, indicating a preference to \"over-invest in the near-term and secure a leadership position than under-invest only to miss what is shaping up to be a significant revenue/growth opportunity,” Goldman analysts said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a stock perspective, analysts view the setup for Nvidia as “constructive.”\n\nThe stock is currently trading at 42x next twelve months (NTM) consensus EPS, with a relative premium of just 46%—a significant discount compared to its past three-year median of 151%.\n\n“In short, we believe risk/reward on the stock is favorable with our most bullish scenario pointing to 89% potential upside vs. 61% potential downside under our most bearish scenario.”\n\nThe analysts reiterate their Buy rating and maintain a price target of $135.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings preview: Goldman reiterates Buy on solid AI infrastructure demand\n\nTrend-following hedge funds returning to Japanese equities, J.P.Morgan says\n\nMajor markets mixed on US rate-cut hopes, weak oil demand\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Intel: 2 Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy After a Sell-Off",
        "content": "Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) was one of the biggest victims of a recent tech sell-off, with its share price down 42% over the last month. Fears of a recession caused doubt among tech investors, triggering a dip for dozens of companies' stocks. Market uncertainty combined with weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings from Intel triggered a significant decline in its shares.\n\nUsually, such a dramatic sell-off would produce a bargain stock price. However, the chart below shows Intel's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains considerably higher than its two biggest chip competitors, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). INTC PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart shows that not only does Intel have the highest forward P/E among these companies, but its figure for the metric is also well above its average since 2022. Meanwhile, AMD's and Nvidia's forward P/Es are relatively close to their averages, making them a bargain compared to Intel.\n\nMoreover, recent earnings suggest Intel's position in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market is less secure than its rivals. In the second quarter of 2024, the company missed earnings-per-share estimates by $0.08 and revenue by $150 million. Recent challenges have seen Intel's quarterly free cash flow dip nearly 5,000% over the last year to a negative $3 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia and AMD have arguably more established roles in AI and have delivered promising financial growth thanks to the expanding industry. So, forget Intel and consider these better AI stocks after a sell-off.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's stock dipped about 10% over the last 30 days amid a pullback in tech. The worst declines had its share price down 25% between July 10 and Aug. 5. However, a recovery appears to be underway, suggesting investing sooner rather than later might be best.\n\nThe company's share price is up 18% over the last week alone, adding more than $420 billion in market value. The surge aligns with Nvidia's recent growth trajectory and its potent role in AI.\n\nNvidia accounts for an estimated 70% to 95% of AI accelerators thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are crucial for building and running AI models because they are capable of completing multiple tasks at once. As a result, GPUs can handle the heavy workloads involved in developing large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and other AI networks.\n\nThe company's powerful role in AI has made it the go-to chip supplier for countless organizations. Some of its biggest customers include tech giants like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Meanwhile, the company supplies its chips for consumer-focused products like Tesla's self-driving technology and Nintendo's Switch console.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia recently partnered with California in an initiative backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to train its residents on AI technology. CEO Jensen Huang said the collaboration will promote job creation and \"train 100,000 students, college faculty, developers, and data scientists to harness this technology.\"\n\nNvidia will post its Q2 of fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug. 28. Quarterly revenue and operating income are up 44% and 63%, respectively, in the last 12 months, with the company consistently beating expectations. The coming earnings release will likely follow recent trends, making Nvidia's stock a compelling buy after a sell-off and a better option than Intel.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAfter a market downturn, AMD's share price is down 22% in the last month. However, consistent financial growth and an expanding position in AI make its stock too good to ignore.\n\nThe chipmaker reported its Q2 2024 earnings at the end of last month, with revenue rising 9% year over year and beating Wall Street forecasts by $120 million. AMD delivered a massive win in its AI-focused data center segment, which saw revenue increase by a record 115% year over year and operating income rise more than 400%.\n\nAMD made promising headway in AI in Q2 2024, as increased AI GPU sales led to impressive financial growth. Meanwhile, the quarter also saw the company hit its highest server central processing unit (CPU) market share in decades. Mercury Research shows AMD's server share increased by 5.6 points since 2023, achieving a 24.1% share.\n\nGrowth in server CPUs shows the company gaining on Intel's position in the market. Intel has dominated CPUs for years, with AMD gradually chipping away at its market share. Yet, AMD has managed to make the business far more lucrative. As Tom's Hardware pointed out, \"While Intel earned $3.0 billion selling 75.9% of data center CPUs (in terms of units), AMD earned $2.8 billion selling 24.1% of server CPUs (in terms of units).\" The disparity is staggering and only strengthens the bullish argument for AMD's stock.\n\nAMD's quarterly free cash flow has risen 81% year to date to $439 million, while Intel's has dipped to a negative $3 billion. The figures suggest AMD is more financially stable, with more cash reserves to keep expanding its business. Alongside a better-valued stock, AMD is a no-brainer AI stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The 500-member tumbled 8.5% between its July high and low in early August, with big tech winners suddenly becoming the big losers.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has since recovered three-quarters of its slide, traders remain wary, with the earnings season still underway.

We expect to see more volatility from here.”\n\nAfter months of calm, the selloff earlier this month pushed the VIX to an almost four-year high, with three-month implied volatility on the Nasdaq 100 ETF reaching its highest level since June 2022 relative to the S&P 500 fund. Swings have abated since, but a Cboe gauge tracking Nasdaq 100 fluctuations remains above its one-year average ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium later this week and Nvidia Corp. earnings on Aug. 28.\n\n“The dispersion around earnings could have spooked investors too, and the top heavy nature of the tech ETFs portends to more expensive options,” said Daniel Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler.\n\nIn the past year, the spread between three-month implied volatility on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has averaged 4.9 points. It’s now at 5.6 points.\n\nThe wild card around the next 10 days is, of course, Nvidia’s earnings, and investors will be paying close attention to what Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says about the outlook. While Nvidia is expected to continue to reap a bonanza, it’s not clear if AI will yield big profit-making breakthroughs from the companies doing the spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the stock already up more than 150% this year, the cost of hedging against declines has increased relative to the days ahead of the last earnings report — though it’s down from a high earlier this month.\n\n“That implies risk aversion,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “If ahead of the last earnings release people were more afraid of missing a rally, now they are a bit more nervous about downside.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "content": "Learning from tech's grandmaster.\n\nIt’s not often that one can absorb life and business lessons from an all-time great. But Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO of AI company DataStax, has the distinct pleasure of being in a rarified group.\n\nDuring his time at the computer company NeXT from 1989 to 1993, which Steve Jobs founded in 1985 and sold to Apple (AAPL) in 1997, Kapoor was the self-professed “person that got coffee for the person that made coffee.\"\n\nKapoor said he learned lessons that stayed with him well into his leadership career.\n\n”There were so many things that I saw [from Steve] that I’ve incorporated into what I do, what I’ve done over the last 30 years,” he told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen in here).\n\nThe former IBM (IBM) and Google (GOOG) exec says in business, inspiration is rarely a problem, but actually reaching innovation is hard. Pushing people to innovate and sweat the details is what Jobs did best.\n\n“Innovation doesn’t happen by saying please go out and do this, you have to push people and get them to a place where they will deliver on something they didn’t think they could deliver on,\" Kapoor said.\n\nBefore Jobs died in 2011 from complications tied to pancreatic cancer, he was considered an inspiration and mentor to many in the business and tech fields. Despite his illness, he continued to innovate on products such as the iPad and iPhone.\n\nThat drive at any cost highlights one of the many lessons Kapoor picked up from working near Jobs in the office.\n\n“He always got up in the morning thinking about what people needed, not what people wanted,\" Kapoor added.\n\nNoting that consumers would be stuck with BlackBerry (BB) technology or Nokia (NOK) phones without Jobs, Kapoor stressed Jobs's “relentless obsession for what people needed\" is something that still influences Kapoor's own work.\n\nKapoor also praised Jobs for his dedication to changing the world.\n\n“I believe it’s about making a dent on the universe,” he said. “I learned from Steve [to ask], ‘Are you changing the world? Are you really thinking about it from the user’s perspective, from a societal perspective, and going off and making that happen?” he asked.\n\nThe ability to put those questions to work is part of what inspires Kapoor.\n\n“I love building product businesses that developers love, the products that developers love, and change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for,” he said.\n\nAnother valuable lesson that comes courtesy of Jobs is making “sure you are very clear on what you’re doing this for,” said Kapoor. “A lot of people in Silicon Valley get stuck where they actually build really cool tech. But the problem is it’s technology. It’s a solution looking for a problem.”\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Apple is the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.43 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data. The company is entering the AI age while raking in billions of dollars each day on the back of Jobs's creations.\n\nAs for the privately held DataStax, it has raised a solid $305 million in capital to support its growth plans. The company's last reported valuation stood at $1.6 billion following a $115 million capital raise in 2022.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Is Nvidia the Future of AI or a Bubble Waiting to Burst?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on an incredible run since the start of 2023. The stock has risen around 700% and has been powered by impressive revenue and earnings growth along the way. A direct line can be drawn from this performance to artificial intelligence (AI) demand.\n\nBut when massive hype surrounds a technology, companies involved in it can be caught up in an investing bubble. When this bubble bursts, it could take years (or decades) to recover. So, is Nvidia the provider of the future? Or is it a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nCould Nvidia be on the brink of collapse?\n\nPerhaps the best comparison to today's AI gold rush is the internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Companies like Cisco and Oracle were spearheading the stock market with the networking equipment needed to proliferate on the internet. However, that bubble burst, and it took Oracle nearly two decades to set a new high, while Cisco is still below its all-time high. ORCL Chart\n\nCould this be in Nvidia's future?\n\nOne of the major differences between what happened in the early 2000s and what is happening now with AI is the speed of the buildout. The internet didn't go up overnight, and the demand was less than expected. For Nvidia, which builds the graphics processing units (GPUs) that do the heavy lifting of AI model training, the demand does exceed expectations.\n\nNvidia is selling billions of dollars' worth of GPUs every quarter, a number that has steadily risen over the past few quarters. Furthermore, with the big tech companies purchasing most of these GPUs and telling investors that 2025 will be another year of heavy capital expenditures due to building out the computing power needed for a leading AI model, Nvidia is likely in good shape from a demand perspective.\n\nWhile the demand is there, the stock could still be considered overvalued and stuck in a bubble if the business can't deliver enough growth. But is that the case?\n\nNvidia has premium margins that could come into question\n\nRight now, Nvidia recently traded for about 68 times trailing earnings, which is very expensive. But that's the wrong metric to use here because its business is rapidly evolving. Instead, I'll use the forward earnings ratio (P/E), which uses analyst projections for the next 12 months. It isn't perfect, but it provides a better picture because the market is a forward-looking machine.\n\nFrom that perspective, Nvidia trades at about 43 times forward earnings. Which still isn't cheap but isn't as bad. By using those two metrics, investors can calculate that analysts project about 59% earnings growth over the next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors might look at the first quarter's results and see 629% growth in earnings per share (EPS) and conclude that this will be a breeze, but that's flawed thinking. Starting in the second quarter, Nvidia will be up against tougher year-over-year comparisons, which might not provide the same impressive growth figures investors have seen over the past year.\n\nFurthermore, its profit margins are at unprecedented levels. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThese are levels significantly above their historical ranges, which indicates that Nvidia can charge a premium for its products because it's the industry leader. As big tech companies start to design their own hardware that can exceed Nvidia's GPU performance on workloads specifically set up to be optimized on a custom chip, those margins could fall.\n\nThis has already begun, as Apple recently used Alphabet's tensor processing unit (TPU) to train its Apple Intelligence model.\n\nBut does this constitute a bubble? I don't think so.\n\nNvidia is still delivering great products and strong growth, so it's not a bubble. However, I think it will face increasingly harder challenges over the next year. I consider the stock expensive, with challenges on the horizon. It might overcome them and continue its historic run. Or it could get crushed. I'm not sure which of these outcomes will occur, so I will stay on the sideline for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "300 Billion Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Now",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has pulled back from its peak in June as the stock market seems to be debating the future of the AI boom.\n\nSome investors think the rally overheated as the new technology has yet to produce a \"killer app\" or make any major disruptions in the economy. There was evidence of this when Alphabet and Microsoft stocks both pulled back following their recent earnings reports as investors questioned the level of spending on AI infrastructure and wondered if those tech giants would get a return on those investments.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of AI bulls remaining, and among them is former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. In a recent conversation at Stanford University, Schmidt commented on the evolution of artificial intelligence, saying that companies were planning to spend tens of billions of dollars or even hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure. Microsoft and OpenAI, for example, are planning for a massive data center and supercomputer project, known as Stargate AI, that could cost as much as $100 billion.\n\nSchmidt went on to say, \"(OpenAI CEO) Sam Altman is a close friend. He believes it's going to take about $300 billion, maybe more...\" The \"it\" here refers to meeting their needs for AI infrastructure.\n\nContinuing, he said, \"If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,\" though he added, \"That's not a stock market recommendation.\"\n\nStill, it's a reminder to investors not to take their eye off the long-term goal when it comes to AI as the buildout is only just beginning. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n$300 billion could be just the start\n\nKeep in mind that Schmidt's quote just refers to open OpenAI's infrastructure needs, so if that's correct, the demand in the industry is much greater than that.\n\nIn fact, Sam Altman is trying to raise as much as $7 trillion to expand the world's semiconductor industry in order to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that is as capable or more capable than a human.\n\nAGI is OpenAI's stated goal, and other tech visionaries like Tesla's Elon Musk are working toward it as well. Investors should expect them to continue to build the needed computing power until AGI is achieved. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that artificial general intelligence is five years away, so the market is likely to see AI investment increase during that time.\n\nWhat it means for Nvidia\n\nIf you look past the market volatility and doubts among investors, nothing has changed about the tech industry's expectations for AI. The race among the \"Magnificent Seven\" and other companies will determine the winners in the industry for the next generation and building the necessary infrastructure is crucial.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia remains the far-and-away leader in data center GPUs and other components needed to run AI models like ChatGPT, and it's likely to continue to dominate that market even as competition from AMD and Intel comes online.\n\nNvidia had an estimated 98% share of the data center GPU market in 2023, and the company's data center revenue jumped 427% in the first quarter to $22.6 billion. That growth rate will slow as it laps the initial generative AI investment boom that followed the launch of ChatGPT, but Nvidia will almost certainly grow at a high rate as the race to AGI picks up.\n\nInvestors can debate the proper valuation for Nvidia stocks, but the strength of its business and its future potential are hard to dispute. The demand ramp for its products still has a long way to go, according to the needs of AGI and statements from the likes of Schmidt and Altman.\n\nIn fact, Schmidt's biggest concern about the surge in AI infrastructure was finding enough electricity to power these massive data centers. While that could be a challenge down the road, taking his advice and buying Nvidia's stock now makes a lot of sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "With Its Blackwell Chips Delayed, Should Investors Delay Buying Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "While there has been a lot of excitement surrounding the launch of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) latest chips based on its new Blackwell architecture, both customers and investors apparently will need to wait a bit longer. According to reports, the shipment of the chips will be delayed, although by how long remains to be seen.\n\nGiven the strong demand that was expected for the chips, let's take a closer look at the issue and the impact it may have on the stock.\n\nDesign flaw\n\nAs first reported by the tech publication website The Information, a design flaw in its Blackwell B200 chip was found \"unusually late\" in the production process. The issue is believed to stem from the company being one of the first to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer's new CoWoS-L packaging technology (\"Chip on Wafer on Substrate with a Local silicon interconnect,\" if you're curious) and the placement of the bridge dies connecting two graphics processing units (GPUs) being less than perfect.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has apparently decided to revamp the design of its Blackwell GPUs, which is expected to delay the start of shipments by three months or more, according to some reports. Customers and partners have indirectly confirmed the delays. Meta Platforms says it doesn't expect to receive Blackwell GPUs this year, while Super Micro Computer executives say they don't expect any real volumes from Blackwell until the March quarter.\n\nAlphabet, Microsoft, and Meta all have huge Blackwell orders worth \"tens of billions of dollars\" that they are looking to get filled, according to The Information. Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this year that Amazon was moving its Nvidia AI accelerator orders from Hopper to Blackwell.\n\nWhile Hopper orders will likely help fill some of the void resulting from the Blackwell delay, the risk is that there is an air pocket if these customers just wait on their large orders.\n\nUBS analysts, however, have come out and said that, after speaking to Nvidia customers, the firm expects the chip delay to only be between four to six weeks and that the delay will be \"invisible\" to most customers. This is much shorter than the initial delay that was reported, which has helped lift the stock off its recent lows. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs it time to buy Nvidia stock?\n\nThe length of the delay for Blackwell will likely have a big impact on Nvidia in the short term. A short delay will likely be good for the stock with hardly any impact on its 2025 results, while a delay of three months or more would be looked upon unfavorably, especially after the idea of a shorter delay has already been floated by a Wall Street analyst.\n\nThere also is the question of whether the design flaw could cause a chip failure or whether it was just leading to less-than-expected production yields. Either way, it appears that the company's decision to delay production of the chip and fix any issues is a smart move.\n\nLonger term, the bigger question surrounding the chip issues is whether Nvidia has sped up its development timeline too quickly. The company has cut its planned development cycle for new chip architectures from two years to one. This should keep demand and prices high, but it's also an aggressive schedule with limited room for error or delays. Being at the forefront of new technology and delivering mass production of your products are two separate things that may not always coincide in the future as well. So these are some risks to consider.\n\nThat said, with a number of customers having absolutely huge orders for its chips, demand is not an issue for Nvidia. Customers are currently more concerned about falling behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race than overbuilding capacity. As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, they will need more and more computing power, which means more GPUs will be needed. For example, Meta said its Llama 4 LLM will likely need 10 times the computing power of its previous version to train.\n\nAnd that right there is the biggest reason to own Nvidia. With a dominant market position in the GPU space, Nvidia will continue to be the biggest beneficiary of the continued push for more computing power.\n\nAt the same time, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of about 30 times based on 2025 analyst estimates. For a company with the growth and long-term prospects of Nvidia, that valuation is quite attractive.

        "content": "The stock market may have witnessed some volatility of late, but it is worth noting that the S&P 500 index has clocked healthy gains of 41% since the beginning of 2023. It's thanks to a solid rally in technology stocks that outperformed the broader market on account of catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThis explains why the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has outperformed the S&P 500 since the beginning of 2023 with astounding gains of 74%. The ability of technology companies to capitalize on disruptive trends over time, such as the internet, smartphones, video streaming, social media, and now AI, is the reason why companies in this sector tend to deliver outsized gains.\n\nThat's the reason why investors would do well to buy shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) in 2024, as both companies are taking advantage of the adoption of AI in their respective industries and could turn out to be top-growth stocks in the long run. Shares of both Nvidia and SoundHound are already up 135% so far this year, and a closer look at their prospects will tell us that their bull run could be here to stay.\n\nNvidia's AI-fueled rally is likely to gain momentum\n\nThough Nvidia has been in fine form on the stock market this year, it has witnessed a slight pullback of late. However, all that could change later this month when the semiconductor giant releases its second-quarter results for fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia is set to release its next set of quarterly results on Aug. 28. Analysts are forecasting the company to deliver $28.5 billion in revenue, which is slightly higher than the chipmaker's forecast of $28 billion. Its earnings are expected to more than double to $0.64 per share from $0.27 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see Nvidia beating Wall Street's forecasts once again -- just like it has done in the past four quarters -- because of its dominant position in the AI chip market.\n\nThe company has witnessed terrific demand for its AI graphics processing units (GPUs), which are powering the growth of Nvidia's data-center business. In Q1 of fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 28), Nvidia's data-center revenue rose 427% year over year to $22.6 billion. Its overall revenue shot up 262% year over year to $26 billion.\n\nNvidia's terrific data-center growth is likely to continue in fiscal Q2 and beyond despite recent rumors that its next-generation Blackwell chips are likely to face a delay of four to six weeks before going into production. That's because Nvidia is witnessing robust demand for its existing H100 and H200 processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Colette Kress remarked on Nvidia's May earnings conference call that the company kept increasing the supply of its previous flagship processor, the H100, despite the availability of a new chip such as the H200. At the same time, Nvidia was finding it difficult to meet the demand for the H200 and expects this chip to remain supply constrained next year.\n\nConcerning the company's next-generation Blackwell processors, sources suggest that Nvidia could generate a whopping $210 billion in revenue from their sales next year. That would be a huge increase over the $47.5 billion data-center revenue the company generated in fiscal 2024. All this explains why analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to nearly double in fiscal 2025 (which will end in January next year) to $120.5 billion from $60.9 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nAlso, as the following chart tells us, analysts have been raising their growth expectations for Nvidia over the next couple of fiscal years as well. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nAll this indicates that Nvidia could continue to remain a top growth stock in 2024 and beyond, making it an ideal bet for growth-oriented investors looking to take advantage of the fast-growing adoption of AI.\n\nSoundHound AI is gaining traction within a fast-growing AI niche\n\nSoundHound AI provides a platform to customers to help them develop voice AI solutions, such as chatbots and conversational voice assistants. The company believes that its total addressable market (TAM) could be worth a whopping $140 billion, and the good part is that it is well on its way to capitalizing on this opportunity.\n\nThe company reported an impressive year-over-year jump of 54% in revenue in 2024's Q2 to $13.5 million. SoundHound AI also acquired enterprise AI software company Amelia for $80 million so that it can expand its reach in the generative AI-powered customer-service space. SoundHound says that after the acquisition, it will be serving 200 marquee customers across the globe, including top banks and Fortune 500 companies.\n\nThanks to this acquisition and SoundHound's growing traction in the restaurant and automotive markets, the company raised its 2024 revenue guidance to at least $80 million as compared to the earlier guidance of $71 million. What's more, SoundHound expects revenue to increase at a terrific pace again in 2025 and exceed $150 million.\n\nSoundHound's 2024 revenue guidance indicates that its top line is on track to increase 74% this year, which would be an improvement over its 2023 revenue growth of 47%. Even better, the 2025 guidance indicates that the company is expecting to deliver an 87% increase in the top line next year.\n\nWe have already seen that SoundHound sees a massive addressable market for its voice AI solutions, which is why there is a good chance that it will be able to sustain its outstanding growth in the long run. So, investors looking to buy a growth stock right now can consider adding SoundHound to their portfolios. Its shares have started taking off after its latest results, and based on the company's prospects, they could keep heading higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying 1 Stock-Split AI Stock Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) aficionado Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has generated incredible returns for shareholders of late, so much so that the chipmaker completed a 10-for-1 stock split in June to reset its soaring share price.\n\nEven so, the hedge fund managers listed below trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the second quarter while reinvesting profits in Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), another semiconductor company that recently completed a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management sold 676,242 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 5%. He also increased his stake in Broadcom by 55%, making it his eighth-largest position, excluding options. Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors sold 9.2 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 79%. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Broadcom by 64%, and it now ranks as his 10th-largest position, excluding options. David Shaw of D.E. Shaw & Co. sold 12.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 52%. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Broadcom by 229%, and it's now his seventh-largest position.\n\nThose three money managers run the best-performing hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, so trades made by Englander, Griffin, and Shaw are noteworthy. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Broadcom.\n\nNvidia: The stock-split AI stock billionaires were selling\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in accelerated computing, a discipline that pairs specialized hardware and software to speed up complex workloads, like 3D graphics and AI applications. Nvidia holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics processors and more than 90% market share in data center GPUs. More importantly, the company currently accounts for more than 80% of AI chip sales.\n\nNvidia's success is due in large part to its robust software ecosystem. Its CUDA platform includes hundreds of software libraries (building blocks) that streamline model training and application development across a range of disciplines, such as scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. The CUDA ecosystem has been in development for almost two decades, which has made Nvidia GPUs the go-to option for developers of accelerated computing applications, especially where AI is concerned.\n\nAngelo Zino at CFRA believes Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.\" That brings me to an important point. Despite cutting their positions in Nvidia during the second quarter, two of the hedge fund managers mentioned earlier still have substantial exposure to the stock. Excluding options, Nvidia is the fifth-largest position in Israel Englander's portfolio and the third-largest in David Shaw's portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia shares could be volatile in the near term because it reports earnings on Aug. 28 and because Blackwell GPU shipments have reportedly been delayed for three months. Those chips, which offer much faster AI training and inference compared to the previous Hopper architecture, were supposed to ship later this year. Management will likely discuss the situation on the earnings call, and the stock could move sharply depending on the context.\n\nThat said, Blackwell GPUs will ship eventually, and Nvidia is ideally positioned to benefit as businesses spend more money on AI. Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 37% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 73 times earnings look relatively reasonable. Those figures have a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) of 2, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\n\nInvestors interested in owning Nvidia stock should start with a small position today. If the stock declines when the company reports earnings later this month, consider buying a few more shares.\n\nBroadcom: The stock-split AI stock billionaires were buying\n\nBroadcom breaks its business into semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. The company has a strong presence in both spaces. Within semiconductor solutions, Broadcom is the market leader in networking chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), custom chips for specialized use cases like AI.\n\nWithin infrastructure software, Broadcom subsidiary VMware is the market leader in server virtualization software and hyperconverged infrastructure, a term that refers to software-defined platforms that combine virtualized compute, storage, and networking to help businesses utilize physical infrastructure more efficiently. Forrester Research has also recognized the company as a leader in cloud cost management software.\n\nLeadership in networking chips should help Broadcom monetize AI, but its leadership in ASICs could be a particularly big source of momentum. Currently, ASICs represent less than 10% of AI chips, but Morgan Stanley thinks that figure could reach 30% in five years. That forecast implies ASICs will take share from GPUs in AI computing. Goldman Sachs analysts recently wrote, \"Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Broadcom to grow non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share at 21% annually through 2026. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 37.8 times non-GAAP earnings look reasonable. Patient investors should consider purchasing a small position in this semiconductor stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the Newest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock in Nvidia's Portfolio (Hint: It's Not SoundHound AI)",
        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), there's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and there's everyone else. The chipmaker has become the poster child for AI as its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for AI systems. So, when Nvidia makes an investment in anything AI-related, investors sit up and take notice.\n\nThat's what happened earlier this year with SoundHound AI. In February, investors learned that Nvidia had taken a small position in the voice and audio recognition specialist, which sent its shares skyward, gaining as much as 93% in the week following the revelation.\n\nNow, history is repeating itself. Last month, Nvidia revealed it had acquired a somewhat sizable stake in Serve Robotics(NASDAQ: SERV), which sent the stock into the stratosphere. Let's take a look at what enticed Nvidia to invest in the company and if it makes sense for investors. Serve Robotics sidewalk delivery robot. Image source: Serve Robotics.\n\nServe'd up hot\n\nServe Robotics describes itself as a \"leading autonomous sidewalk delivery company.\" The company went public without much fanfare on April 18, offering up 10 million shares of common stock at $4 per share. The stock initially slipped under the radar and interest was weak, as the stock ended its first day of trading down 22%.\n\nThe company is focusing on what management believes is a $450 billion market using robotics and drones for last-mile delivery. For example, the company estimates that the median distance of food deliveries in the U.S. is 2.5 miles. It further suggests that the average cost to cover that distance using its autonomous robots would be about $1, much cheaper than existing alternatives -- while cutting down on the greenhouse gas emissions caused by automobiles.\n\nServe first launched its fleet of sidewalk delivery robots in Los Angeles in 2020. By the end of the year, these robots had completed more than 10,000 deliveries for food delivery service Postmates -- now owned by Uber Technologies.\n\nUber has a commercial partnership agreement with Serve to deploy as many as 2,000 of its delivery robots by 2025, up from Serve's current fleet of roughly 100. The expansion will see at least 250 robots in Los Angeles by the first quarter of 2025, expanding into new geographic markets beginning in Q2.\n\nNot just Nvidia\n\nIn a regulatory filing that dropped on July 18, Nvidia revealed that it owned more than 3.7 million shares of Serve Robotics stock, amounting to a 10% position in the company, with that stake that was valued at roughly $10 million (at the time). Word of Nvidia's investment stoked interest in the tiny company, driving its shares up 335% (as of market close on Thursday). However, several developments in recent weeks have compounded investor excitement, and it isn't just about Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust this week, Serve announced a partnership with Shake Shack to deliver its food orders through Uber Eats in Los Angeles. Scoring a well-known fast-casual chain like Shake Shack was a coup for Serve, elevating its profile in the food delivery space.\n\nThis announcement came on the heels of Serve Robotics' second-quarter financial results, which were better than expected. The company generated revenue of $470,000, which included $300,000 from auto parts supplier Magna to license its robotic technology. Delivery revenue of $170,000 surged 178% year over year and 80% sequentially. At the same time, gross margin for the segment improved 85% year over year and 64% quarter over quarter.\n\nHelping drive its financial results was a strong operating performance. Serve averaged 385 daily supply hours during the quarter, up 106% year over year and 28% sequentially. The company also increased its daily active robots by 85% year over year and 23% sequentially.\n\nShould investors follow Nvidia?\n\nWhile Nvidia's stake in Serve Robotics is notable, it needs to be put in perspective. At the end of the second quarter, Serve represented less than 2% of Nvidia's AI-focused portfolio. For context, chipmaker Arm Holdings made up about 82%.\n\nWith a market cap of roughly $422 million, Serve Robotics barely rises to the level of small-cap and has yet to generate a profit. As such, the stock will be extremely volatile and far more risky than an investment in Nvidia. There's also the matter of valuation, as Serve's stock is currently selling for 259 times forward sales. For context, Nvidia is selling for 25 times forward sales, a bargain considering its triple-digit growth.\n\nInvestors who really want a piece of Serve Robotics shouldn't buy any more than a tiny stake befitting such a risky bet. Better yet, they can simply buy Nvidia, thereby owning Serve by proxy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Serve Robotics right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Serve Robotics, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Serve Robotics wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amid a 14% Sell-Off, Nvidia Just Hit Investors With a Rude Awakening. What Should Investors Do?",
        "content": "The capital markets got off to a roaring start in 2024. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have given back some of their gains over the last month or so as equities have experienced some pronounced selling activity. As of the time of this article, shares of artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have fallen nearly 14% in the last month.\n\nWhile some of the decline can be attributed to sell-offs in the broader market, Nvidia recently hit investors with some disappointing news. Should investors be bothered by this dilemma, or is this a rare chance to buy the dip in AI's hottest stock?\n\nWhat's going on with Nvidia stock?\n\nThere are a lot of factors influencing Nvidia stock's recent price action.\n\nFor starters, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3% in July -- its highest level in over two years. Moreover, recent commentary from the Federal Reserve continues to have economists questioning whether or not a cut to interest rates is on the horizon or not.\n\nAll things considered, the cloudy macroeconomic picture coupled with some typical election-driven volatility has surely caused some investors to start selling stock and hoard cash amid a pool of uncertainty. Unfortunately, this is only one side of the equation for Nvidia investors. Perhaps most concerning of all is that Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell graphics processing unit (GPU) is facing delays due to design flaws, according to several media outlets.\n\nConsidering companies of all sizes and every industry are doubling down on generative AI investments, Nvidia's Blackwell delay doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Nevertheless, I don't think this is necessarily a reason for investors to hit the panic button just yet. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy the Blackwell delay isn't a big deal\n\nWhile estimates vary, public research suggests that Nvidia owns at least 80% of the AI chip market. So, while a delay to the Blackwell launch may be a lowlight, it's extraordinarily unlikely that Nvidia will lose significant market share as a result of this design blunder.\n\nChief Investment Officer of Harvest Portfolio Management Paul Meeks recently expressed a similar sentiment during an interview on CNBC. He makes a great point in that demand for Nvidia's GPUs is so high that the company will have no real problem selling the Blackwell chips once they actually come to market -- regardless of the delay.\n\n\"I just need to see these stocks stabilize for a couple of sessions at some sort of trough level.\"\r\n\r\nHarvest Portfolio Management Co-CIO Paul Meeks is closely watching the technicals as he discusses why he isn't buying the dip in tech just yet: pic.twitter.com/XqsOM9qABO\n\n-- Money Movers (@moneymoverscnbc) August 5, 2024\n\nAdditionally, each of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies has reported earnings this season except Nvidia. One of the common threads stitching mega-caps together is that spending on AI-powered products and services has steadily risen over the last year. In particular, capital expenditures (capex) have been on the rise among mega-cap tech as demand for cloud computing infrastructure, data center services, and semiconductor chips increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering that the bulk of Nvidia's revenue growth currently stems from hardware operations in chips and data centers, I think the rising investment in capex among big tech companies represents a compelling secular narrative around Nvidia's bright future.\n\nBuy the dip like there's no tomorrow\n\nWhen investors are hit with some distressing news, it's always important to zoom out and consider all the variables.\n\nBack in 1997, Apple nearly filed for bankruptcy. Today, Apple is the largest company in the world by market cap. Even the best companies hit road bumps from time to time. What's more important is how management navigates these challenges in the moment.\n\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) multiple over the last month. While a 14% drop in Nvidia stock may not seem like a lot in the grand scheme of things, the compression this decline has made on valuation multiples in such a short timeframe shouldn't be overlooked. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nOutside of its GPUs, the company is quietly building a software platform to complement the core chip business. Additionally, the company has made a number of strategic investments in areas such as robotics to further diversify its AI ecosystem.\n\nI don't see any of these initiatives as priced into Nvidia stock at the moment. In fact, I think much of what Nvidia is doing outside of GPUs is not yet fully understood. For these reasons, I think the reaction to the Blackwell delay is overblown and view the recent sell-off as a no-brainer opportunity to buy Nvidia stock right now as further gains look to be in store over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 ETF I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "Since they were introduced to the stock market in the 1990s, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been among the most useful tools for investors. They offer all the broad market exposure of mutual funds, but they come in a more investor-friendly package -- their fees are typically lower, and they can be bought and sold in a brokerage account just like stocks. Investing made simple(r).\n\nThere are countless ETFs on the stock market, covering virtually any sector, industry, interest, or theme you could be interested in. Whether it's technology, cannabis, or space exploration, if you want to find an ETF for it, you likely can. That said, not all ETFs are equally helpful, and some are worth avoiding.\n\nOne ETF in particular I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole right now is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) -- even with its recent success.\n\nToo few companies are leading the charge\n\nThis 320-stock ETF contains large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies in the information technology sector. These companies' specialties include semiconductors (29.9% of the ETF), systems software (22.2%), technology hardware and storage (18.1%), application software (13.4%), communications equipment (3.1%), and a handful more.\n\nSince the ETF is weighted by market cap, larger companies exert more influence than smaller companies. Unfortunately, that's part of the problem. Here are the ETF's top three holdings and how much of the fund they make up:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 16.66% Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 16.07% Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 14.63%\n\nThree companies that make up less than 1% of the ETF's companies account for more than 47% of its weight. There's a lack of diversification, and then there's this.\n\nWhen it's great, it's great; when it's not, it's bad\n\nIt's only fair to acknowledge that the ETF has been wildly successful over the past decade, far outperforming the U.S. stock market's three major indexes. In fact, none of the indexes have come even remotely close to the ETF's returns over that span. VGT Chart\n\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are three of the best companies in the world. Microsoft has been at the top of the tech food chain for almost 50 years, Apple is arguably the gold standard for consumer electronics, and Nvidia is one of the companies at the forefront of AI technology.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, \"The same thing that makes you laugh can make you cry.\" The success of the above three companies has pushed the index forward over the past decade, but any down period for the three could drag down the ETF's performance. As an example, let's look at the past month when the three companies experienced a pullback.\n\nStory continues VGT Chart\n\nOf course, Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia aren't solely responsible for the ETF's decline over that span. But considering how much of it they account for and their declines, they bear a decent amount of the responsibility. As they go, so goes the ETF.\n\nDo I expect these three companies to have bad years? Not at all. Are they priced at a premium and susceptible to a correction if market conditions change? For sure.\n\nThere may be a better route for investors\n\nInstead of investing in this ETF and putting its success (or lack thereof) in the hands of a few companies, you should consider a similar but more diversified ETF like the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF(NASDAQ: QQQ). It mirrors the Nasdaq-100, an index that contains the largest 100 nonfinancial companies trading on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nIt's not a pure tech ETF like the Vanguard ETF, but 50% of the ETF is made up of information technology companies, and its top three holdings are the same:\n\nApple: 9.14% Microsoft: 8.32% Nvidia: 7.10%\n\nThis gives you a chance to get the benefits of investing in some of the world's best tech companies without relying too much on their success to boost the ETF's performance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Chip Stock Will Beat Nvidia in the 2nd Half of the Year",
        "content": "There's no question that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the flagbearer for the AI boom thus far. Even after the recent pullback, the stock is still up more than 600% since start of 2023, adding trillions in market value along the way.\n\nHowever, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns, and the AI rally is starting to broaden as investors look for alternatives to Nvidia, which may struggle to get back to its peak this year. One chip stock that looks like it has a good chance of outperforming Nvidia over the rest of the year is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), the fabless chip maker best known for its PC CPUs that is now seeing rapid growth from data center GPUs.\n\nLet's take a few reasons AMD can beat Nvidia in the second half of the year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Its chief rival is faltering\n\nAMD's main competition in the PC, or client market, is Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the chipmaker that has dominated the PC CPU market since its early days and still has a majority of market share in the segment.\n\nIntel just announced its biggest restructuring in years, with plans to lay off at least 15% of its workforce through the end of 2025 as part of a plan to cut $10 billion in costs. The company also reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, issued weak guidance, and eliminated its dividend. In total, the announcement portrayed a company in disarray in spite of CEO Pat Gelsinger's having had three years to mount a turnaround at the legacy chipmaker.\n\nIntel stock plunged on the news, and its retrenchment seems to open up an opportunity for rival AMD.\n\nThe next battleground between the two companies could be the AI PC chip market, and AMD seems likely to have an advantage here. AMD CEO Lisa Su aid that the reviews of its new AI PC products like the Zen 5 platform are \"very positive\" and was bullish on growth in the PC market heading into 2025, calling it \"a good revenue growth opportunity for us.\"\n\nIntel also expressed optimism about its Lunar Lake AI PC chip but acknowledged that it could be a drag on margins because of its outsourced components, meaning it won't be the game-changer that Intel seems to need.\n\nAMD also has much more momentum in the client segment at the moment, with second-quarter revenue in that segment jumped 49% to $1.5 billion. Intel, meanwhile, reported just 9% growth in that segment to $7.4 billion.\n\nExpect AMD to continue gaining market share from Intel in the massive market.\n\n2. Data center revenue is taking off\n\nAMD's Mi300 data center GPU is now available, and it's rapidly gaining traction. Data center revenue jumped 115% in the second quarter to $2.8 billion, making up nearly half of the company's revenue in the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nMi300 topped $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, and its customer base is expanding as Microsoft became the first cloud infrastructure to open general availability to the Instinct Mi300X. Instinct is AMD's data center platform, and AMD said that major server makers such as Dell and Super Micro Computer have Instinct platforms in production.\n\nData center revenue tends to be higher margin than other segments, which should drive AMD's profit higher in the coming quarters as the company expects strong data center growth to continue.\n\nThe company also just acquired Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab, which will help strengthen its development of generative AI technologies such as inference and training, as well as large language models.\n\n3. Nvidia's Blackwell delay also gives AMD an opportunity\n\nNvidia recently found a design flaw in its new Blackwell platform that's causing a three-month delay in new chips. There's still a shortage of data center GPUs, and the news could give an opening to AMD to grab more market share. It could also weigh on Nvidia's results over the next few quarters.\n\nWhile Nvidia's leadership in the data center GPU market isn't in jeopardy, as it's much larger than its rivals such as AMD, the Blackwell delay could also weigh on its stock price and cause some reputation damage. It may be the most meaningful setback to Nvidia since the AI rally began.\n\nThe future for AMD\n\nWith Nvidia now trading at a market cap of $2.7 trillion and its growth now set to slow, its upside potential seems more limited than AMD's, which could double off its current market cap of $220 billion as data center revenue accelerates and it takes market share from Intel.\n\nRecent declines in the gaming and embedded segments should soon bottom out as well lifting overall results. It won't take much to deliver significant bottom-line gains for AMD. If it can top estimates, the stock could soar in the coming months.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Is Going to Be Crushed by Competition Over the Next 2 Years -- but Not for the Reason You Might Think",
        "content": "For much of the last 19 months, the bulls have been in control on Wall Street. All three major stock indexes have catapulted to multiple record-closing highs this year, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) being the primary catalyst.\n\nThe excitement surrounding AI has to do with the capacity for software and systems to learn over time without human intervention. This machine-learning ability should allow AI-driven software and systems to become more proficient at their assigned tasks and learn new skills, thus giving the technology utility in most sectors and industries.\n\nAlthough estimates vary wildly for AI, the analysts at PwC released a report last year (Sizing the Prize) claiming the technology could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy via increased production and consumption-side benefits, by 2030.\n\nNo company has benefited more from the sky-high euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence than semiconductor titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUntil recently, Nvidia's operating execution had been virtually flawless\n\nThe reason investors have flocked to Nvidia above all other AI companies is its hardware. Its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) rapidly became the standard chip used by businesses running generative AI solutions and training large language models (LLMs) in high-compute data centers. Nvidia was responsible for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped for use in data centers last year, per TechInsights.\n\nWhat's more, the company's hardware is in such high demand that it and its next-generation chips are backlogged. When demand for a good or service overwhelms supply, it's perfectly normal for the price of said good or service to climb. A substantial increase in the price of Nvidia's H100 GPU has boosted the company's adjusted gross margin by 13.7 percentage points over the last five reported quarters.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has also overseen a major investment in ongoing innovation that should help Nvidia retain its GPU advantages. The company's next-gen Blackwell chip is aimed at accelerating capacity in six areas, including generative AI, while using less energy than its predecessor chip. Meanwhile, the Rubin platform, which will run on the all-new Vera processor, is set for delivery sometime in 2026.\n\nThese catalysts have helped to lift Nvidia's market cap by $2.4 trillion since the start of 2023, translating into a gain of 695% for investors as of the closing bell on Aug. 13.\n\nWhile things have seemingly been picture-perfect for Nvidia and its shareholders, my prediction is that the going is about to get significantly tougher for Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is about to get crushed by competition -- but likely not in the way you think\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds and/or competitive pressures. Despite maintaining a near-monopoly in AI-GPUs for data centers, Nvidia is liable to be crushed by competitive pressures over the coming two years.\n\nSome of you might be thinking I have no clue what I'm talking about given the well-defined advantages Nvidia's H100 and upcoming Blackwell chips pack over other key hardware players -- and I don't disagree with you. There's a really good chance Nvidia's willingness to spend aggressively on research will allow the H100, Blackwell, and possibly even Rubin platform to remain at the top of the pack, in terms of computing ability.\n\nThe problem for Nvidia is that computing capacity represents only one of the factors businesses are considering when building out their AI-accelerated data centers. That capacity is, undeniably, important...but it's not everything.\n\nDespite efforts by global chip-fabrication leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity is still insufficient to cover Nvidia's needs. CoWoS is a veritable necessity for packaging the high-bandwidth memory needed in high-capacity data centers. In other words, Nvidia's chips might be faster, but the company can't meet all of its orders or deliver anytime soon.\n\nWhen you're talking about first-mover advantages in generative AI and LLMs, at least some businesses aren't going to wait to fill valuable hardware \"real estate\" in their data centers. Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has been ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which has a median price point of around $15,000, compared to the H100, which comes in at around $30,000 per chip. AMD's chip might not have a computing advantage over the H100, but at roughly half the cost and with far less of a backlog, it has AMD sitting pretty.\n\nAMD isn't the only external competitor vying for data center real estate. With reports suggesting Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be delayed by at least three months due to design flaws and supplier constraints, tech juggernauts Samsung and Huawei are entering the picture with AI chips of their own.\n\nBut wait -- there's more.\n\nNvidia's top four customers by net sales, which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" are developing AI-GPUs for their data centers, too.\n\nMore than likely, these chips don't have a chance of outperforming the H100 or Blackwell on the basis of computing capacity. But that's not going to stop Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet from complementing the chips they have purchased from Nvidia with internally designed chips that will ultimately be substantially cheaper and easier to access. Once again, we're talking about Nvidia's hardware losing out on valuable data center real estate. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle\n\nOn top of my forecast that Nvidia's stock can be clobbered by competitive pressures over the next two years, the company will also have to contend with three decades of undefeated history when it comes to next-big-thing innovations, technologies, and trends.\n\nOver the last 30 years, no shortage of game-changing technologies and trends have graced Wall Street. The advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, cryptocurrency, 3D printing, blockchain technology, cannabis, augmented/virtual reality, the metaverse, and now AI are just some of these growth-powering trends.\n\nWith the exception of AI, every other buzzy innovation, technology, or trend in the last 30 years navigated a bubble in its early stages. This early-innings bubble is evidence that investors regularly overestimate how quickly new technologies and trends are going to be adopted at the consumer and/or enterprise level. When lofty targets aren't met and the initial euphoria fades, the bubble eventually bursts.\n\nThere's nothing to suggest that artificial intelligence is a mature technology. In fact, most businesses lack a clearly defined game plan as to how AI will be used to grow their sales and improve their bottom lines. This is all the evidence we need that euphoria surrounding AI has stepped well past the bounds of reality.\n\nIf and when the artificial intelligence bubble bursts (which history suggests it will), no stock will be hit harder than Nvidia.\n\nAlthough long-term investors in Nvidia are still going to be up a boatload if Nvidia retraces 50%, 60%, or even 80%, the next two years are shaping up to be challenging for Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. IBM",
        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom has launched a golden age for chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and its investors. Software and services veteran IBM(NYSE: IBM) also benefits from the same trend, but in a very different way.\n\nWhich one of these tech titans is the better AI stock in the summer of 2024? Let's take a look.\n\nNvidia's generative AI bonanza\n\nNvidia wasn't a very exciting story before the generative AI surge. Two years ago, the company tried its best to distance itself from cryptocurrency mining and the lockdown-boosted consumer interest in video gaming gear was fading out. Nvidia was already shipping tons of AI accelerator chips behind the scenes, but to limited fanfare because nobody had seen ChatGPT yet. If anything, Nvidia's involvement in self-driving vehicle systems looked like a promising growth catalyst back then.\n\nOh my, how times have changed.\n\nIt's common knowledge that ChatGPT's artificial brain was built around Nvidia chips, and the company quickly emerged as the go-to supplier of AI accelerator hardware. One Nvidia A100, H100, or L40S accelerator card costs between $8,000 and $30,000. You need tens of thousands of these products to train a modern large language model (LLM). Those chip sales come in large, lucrative batches.\n\nSo Nvidia's sales soared 262% year-over-year in May's first-quarter report. Data center sales, including the aforementioned AI accelerators, accounted for 87% of these revenues. That's up from 60% in the year-ago period and 45% the year before that.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's earnings and cash flows are skyrocketing. So is the stock price. Nvidia investors have enjoyed a tenfold multiplication of their stakes from the two-year lows in October 2022.\n\nThe stock is obviously up for good reason, but the AI enthusiasm feels a bit overheated. Whether you look at price to sales, price to earnings, or price to free cash flows, Nvidia is trading well above its long-term valuation ratio averages.\n\nLong story short, Nvidia looks overvalued despite its soaring financials. I'd be a buyer again if the stock took a dramatic dip, but I cashed in some of my Nvidia profits in the spring and it's no more than a \"hold\" idea right now.\n\nHow IBM's drastic strategy shift is paying off\n\nUnlike Nvidia, Big Blue isn't a hardware provider these days. I mean, its unique mainframe systems still provide some exposure to the hardware side of the tech world, but the company as a whole has refocused on software and services.\n\nThanks to its exclusive focus on business-class customers, the market was a bit slow to give IBM credit for its AI prospects. Enterprise-scale clients must put new software tools through the wringer of performance, security, and integration tests while also seeking budget approvals from several layers of management. It takes time, but the resulting contracts tend to be robust and long-lived.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's where the company stands today. Many testing processes and approvals have run their course and IBM is starting to generate serious sales from its AI solutions under the Watson banner.\n\nIn July's second-quarter report, IBM reported $2 billion in generative AI orders, up from zero a year ago as the underlying watsonx service was launched in the summer of 2023. Management raised their full-year software growth guidance from mid-single-digits to high-single-digits -- an impressive boost since more than 80% of IBM's software sales are tied to multi-year contracts. And CEO Arvind Krishna expects that growth rate to climb into double-digit territory in 2025 and beyond.\n\nBig Blue's AI growth is more mellow than Nvidia's, but I also expect it to have more staying power. Sudden bursts of chip sales are one thing. A rising tide of long-term software contracts is another animal. I'd much rather invest in the slower burn with longer-lasting consequences.\n\nAnd then there's the valuation angle. Next to Nvidia's lofty multiples, IBM's valuation ratios look like a fire sale: NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nWhy IBM is a better AI stock to buy today than Nvidia\n\nI'm still holding some of my old Nvidia shares but I'm not looking to buy more any time soon. New money is much more likely to go into my IBM position instead, as that tech titan still looks undervalued.\n\nWall Street is slow to forgive IBM for a decade-long strategy shift, though I'd argue that it was exactly the right move at the right time. The next few years should show investors how well the new focus on software, services, cloud computing, and AI will work out in the long run. This is a great AI stock to buy now and hold for decades.\n\nAnd at the same time, Nvidia seems headed for a sharp price correction. Call me back when that stock has dropped at least 30% lower and preferably even more.\n\nWhile Nvidia's rapid growth is impressive, its valuation is too high. Meanwhile, IBM offers a more stable growth story as its radical strategy shift starts to pay dividends, making it an attractive option for new investments.\n\nYou heard it here first.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors have over £53bn across funds that have consistently underperformed, with managers with low or zero exposure to AI-themed stocks and the energy sector lagging.\n\nGlobal equity funds were the most prominent offenders in Bestinvest’s latest ‘Spot the Dog’ report, with 44 funds making the list, a slight improvement from 51 earlier in the year. A third of these global funds are focused on sustainable investing, missing out on gains from the surge in oil and gas stocks.\n\nUK equity funds also featured prominently, with 44 funds flagged, a significant increase from 12 a year ago. Ethical and sustainable funds make up about a quarter of these underperformers, largely due to their lack of exposure to the UK's energy and commodities sectors.\n\nThe report found 137 equity investment funds holding £53.42bn consistently underperformed. You can read the full list here.\n\nThe number of ‘dog funds’ has dropped by 9% since the start of the year, when 151 funds made the list. However, it remains significantly higher than the 56 funds flagged only a year ago.\n\nThe value of assets tied up in these underachieving funds has also fallen sharply, dropping to £53.42 billion—44% less than the £95.26bn reported in the previous edition, primarily due to a few large funds narrowly avoiding the list.\n\nRead more: Where to invest your money when interest rates are falling\n\nTo make it into the list, a fund must have underperformed compared to the market it invests in by 5% or more over a three-year period.\n\nA second filter is that the fund must also have underperformed in three successive 12-month periods in a row.\n\nFund performance can falter for various reasons, ranging from poor decision-making to investment strategies falling out of favour with current market trends. This issue is particularly pressing as investors question why so many funds continue to lag behind their benchmarks, especially given the recent boom in AI, which has invigorated the US stock market and global equities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the rally has been driven by a narrow group of US megacap companies benefiting from AI, making it challenging for fund managers who lack exposure to these few giants to keep up.\n\nThe AI-driven surge in select stocks fails to capture the broader equity market's struggles over the past three years. A notable trend, consistent with previous reports, is the high representation of ESG and ethical funds among the underperformers. These funds account for a fifth of the Spot the Dog list, reflecting the unexpected rise in oil and gas prices due to post-pandemic supply chain issues and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nRead more: Investors flock to tech funds amid AI race\n\nJason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest, said: “The high number of sustainable or responsible funds in the latest Spot the Dog report partly reflects the strong performance of oil and gas stocks in 2021-22. Over the three-year period covered, the MSCI World Energy Index delivered a total return of 98% in GBP, compared to the MSCI World Index's 28%. Conversely, the alternative and renewable energy market has struggled, with the MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index declining by 38% over the same period.”\n\nHollands anticipates a reduction in ESG funds on the list in future reports as the impact of surging energy stocks fades. He also noted the dominance of companies like NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT)—dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven\"—which have driven market performance recently. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index has surged 42% over the past year, with these companies now making up a significant portion of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and MSCI World indices.\n\nRead more: Best UK savings accounts offering above inflation rates\n\nThe previous edition of the report included two of Britain's most prominent funds—Terry Smith's Fundsmith Equity and Nick Train's WS Lindsell Train UK Equity—but both have now dropped off the list. Despite this, the presence of large funds remains a concern, with ten funds over £1 billion in size accounting for £26.81bn, or half of the assets in underperforming funds.\n\nHollands said: “The Spot the Dog report is a timely reminder for investors to regularly review their portfolios. While the report highlights underperforming funds, it also stresses the importance of monitoring investments and considering whether changes are needed.\n\n\"Identifying whether a fund is struggling due to short-term challenges or more deep-rooted issues is crucial for investors deciding whether to hold or sell.”\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

That’s because Nvidia is outpacing its competition, capitalizing on the industry’s explosive growth, and continuously innovating to maintain its dominant position.\n\nAs a refresher, Nvidia is known for designing and manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs) that are widely used in gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and, most notably, artificial intelligence applications.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Industry’s CAGR\n\nArtificial intelligence is still set to expand meaningfully over the next few years. Data from Grand View Research indicates that the AI industry will maintain a 36.6% CAGR from now until 2030.\n\nWhile that’s good news for AI companies in general, it’s even better news for Nvidia. That’s because Nvidia is outgrowing the competition, and an expanding industry gives Nvidia more room to expand.\n\nRecent statements from ex-Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt revealed that many tech giants are ramping up their AI investments. He mentioned that some companies are ready to commit $20-100 billion in AI infrastructure. Many companies will benefit, but Nvidia will win the most from this development.\n\nWhy Companies Rely on Nvidia’s Chips\n\nNvidia has a vast technology lead over its competitors. Some of its offerings have zero competition and are critical for AI infrastructure. That rare advantage helps Nvidia set high prices for its products and services.\n\nWhile competitors are creating their own AI chips and resources, Nvidia is developing strong relationships with big tech companies. Nvidia also continues to innovate with new chips so it can constantly remain a few steps ahead of the competition. Even as tech giants create their own AI chips, they continue to work with Nvidia because the company is second to none in a booming industry.\n\nNvidia is the gateway into an industry that feels as revolutionary as the internet. Tech giants aren’t going to give up on that type of opportunity, even if the cost of entry is high.\n\nDemand Continues to Grow\n\nObserving the guidance issued by other AI companies can give a hint of where Nvidia is heading. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) is a Nvidia partner that has also benefitted from the AI boom, and its Fiscal 2025 outlook should be encouraging for Nvidia investors.\n\nSuper Micro generated $14.94 billion in Fiscal 2024 and projects that Fiscal 2025 revenue will range from $26.0 billion to $30.0 billion. After more than doubling its revenue year-over-year in Fiscal 2024, Super Micro is expected to achieve a similar result in Fiscal 2025. The company also mentioned that a Nvidia Blackwell delay won’t have much of an impact on its sales.\n\nRising demand for Super Micro’s AI products indicates that Nvidia will experience robust demand growth in the upcoming quarters. Nvidia also issued optimistic earnings that suggest more growth is on the way for long-term investors.\n\nNvidia’s Earnings\n\nNvidia’s revenue soared by 262% year-over-year in the first quarter of Fiscal 2025. While it’s an incredible number, it’s even more impressive that investors have been conditioned to expect these types of growth rates from Nvidia. Further, net income jumped by 628% year-over-year, resulting in a 57.1% net profit margin.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang referred to AI as “the next industrial revolution” in the firm’s Q1 press release. Financials certainly paint that picture, as Nvidia is expected to generate revenue of $28.0 billion in the second quarter of Fiscal 2025, plus or minus 2%.\n\nHowever, it’s reasonable to assume that Nvidia crushes that guidance. Not only does Supermicro’s full-year guidance point to booming demand for the industry, but Nvidia beat its own guidance in the first quarter.\n\nThe AI leader announced during its Q4 FY24 results that it expected to generate $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%, in Q1 FY25. As a pleasant surprise, Nvidia closed out the first quarter with $26.0 billion in revenue. That figure is 8.3% higher than Nvidia’s guidance. Assuming Nvidia does something like that again, it’s feasible that the company’s total sales exceed $30 billion in Q2 FY25.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nNvidia is a top stock to buy, according to Wall Street Analysts. Nvidia has earned 37 Buys and four Hold ratings in the past three months, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target suggests 16% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $200 implies that Nvidia can gain an additional 61% from current levels.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nThe Bottom Line on Nvidia Stock\n\nNvidia is the unquestionable leader in the artificial intelligence industry. It should be the main winner in the future as the industry maintains a 36.6% CAGR through 2030. The stock has trounced market indices for several years and briefly became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Nvidia is likely to reclaim that crown.\n\nArtificial intelligence is an innovative opportunity that Huang compared to the Industrial Revolution. While that comparison comes from Nvidia’s CEO, the billions of dollars that pour into Nvidia’s coffers come from many tech giants that recognize the rising potential of AI. Thus, Nvidia is a promising growth stock that should continue to lead the stock market higher.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Big Tech Rout Turns to Dip-Buyer Bounty as Stocks Surge Back",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- It looked like a reckoning was arriving on August 5, when the Nasdaq 100 tumbled over 5% in the seconds after the opening bell, validating fears that a tech bubble was about to burst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nBarely just two weeks and a few rounds of reassuring data later, virtually all those worries are being swiftly swept aside.\n\nThe worst intraday tech-stock selloff since 2022, it turned out, looked to investors like a reset that took some of the froth off valuations — and they have piled back in.\n\n“The August selloff was the closest thing we’ve seen to a buying opportunity for tech in about a year,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “In an environment where growth is slowing, big tech names offer investors an opportunity to be in companies that are not only growing strongly, but which are more insulated from the economic backdrop.”\n\nThe stocks have since staged a sharp turnaround as data signals that the US economy continues to expand and inflation is easing, rekindling the soft-landing speculation that helped power much of this year’s equity-market gains.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has rallied for the past seven sessions, driving it toward the biggest weekly advance since November and back toward the record high hit on July 10.\n\nAt the forefront of the rally were the same heavyweights that had dragged it down. Nvidia Corp. has rallied some 26% off this month’s lows, adding more than $600 billion in market value. Apple Inc. is headwind into the weekend riding an eight-day winning streak that has it within 4% of a record. An index of the Magnificent Seven tech giants has gained nearly 10%.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that concerns about the sector’s longer-term outlook have disappeared. But some of the worries that helped sparked the rout — lofty valuations that were getting harder to justify and fears that the Fed would need to shift into recession-fighting mode — have moved to the background again.\n\n“Given their market positions, exposure to AI, their deep pockets and strong profits, big tech stocks deserve a valuation premium,” said Robert Stimpson, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Oak Associates. “We look at tech as having both offensive and defensive characteristics.”\n\nThe rally drew fuel from numerous quarters. Hedge funds took advantage of last week’s selloff to load up on tech stocks, as well as other sectors such as communication services and consumer staples, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s prime brokerage. Companies themselves were also aggressive buyers, with Goldman’s buyback desk reporting record orders from corporations. Individual buyers dove in, too, logging the biggest net buying activity of the past 12 months, according to data from Vanda Research.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the macro backdrop shifted quickly, with weak job numbers now overshadowed by a surge in retail sales, and could very well swing the other way again.\n\nBut the companies have continued to throw off big profits. While earnings growth from the tech giants is slowing, it remains immense by traditional standards, allowing them to continue to invest heavily in AI. With reports in from four of the five biggest US technology companies — Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. — profit growth for the group is on track to rise 35% in the quarter ending in June, compared with 13% for the S&P 500 Index.\n\nThe investment spending fueled by those profits is boding well for Nvidia, the chipmaker that’s been the biggest beneficiary of the AI build-out. Nvidia is expected to report earnings on Aug. 28 and investors will be paying close attention to what Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says about the outlook.\n\nWhile Nvidia is expected to continue to reap a bonanza, it’s still not clear if AI will yield big profit-making breakthroughs from the companies doing the spending. And those doubts may continue to shadow the stocks despite the recent rally.\n\n“There’s more trepidation when it comes to buying big tech hand over fist, without clear payback periods for AI,” said Ameriprise’s Saglimbene. “That is likely to continue for the next couple of quarters.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Nvidia’s earnings could turn around the ailing AI trade",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence trade has been losing its luster as of late. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), three of AI’s biggest players, are down over the last month, with Google parent Alphabet dropping 14%, Amazon off about 8%, and Microsoft falling more than 7% as of Thursday.\n\nThe stock moves come after the companies, along with fellow hyperscaler Meta (META), confirmed they’ll continue to pour billions of dollars into building out their AI infrastructure over the coming quarters — without providing much insight into when they’re going to turn all of that spending into revenue. That, along with the recent market turmoil, has put a damper on AI company stocks.\n\nBut the most important component of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA), still has to report its earnings. The chip company’s performance could turn around the AI trade more than any hyperscaler. Unlike those software firms, revenue hasn’t been a problem for Nvidia. Still, if it falls short of Wall Street’s already sky-high expectations, it could bring the AI trend down with it.\n\nNvidia’s huge year-over-year gains won’t last forever\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft’s AI spending might be giving investors pause, but it’s helping pad Nvidia’s bottom line. The company’s Hopper AI chips are the most sought-after on the market, and the firm is set to begin ramping up production of its Blackwell line later this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company controls 80% to 95% of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters. That means every time a company says it's spending on AI capabilities, chances are it’s buying up, or at least using, Nvidia’s processors.\n\nBut Nvidia’s second quarter report also marks the start of what will be several quarters of difficult year-over-year revenue growth comparisons. The company’s fiscal Q2 2024 revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 101% year over year. Data center revenue topped $10.3 billion, up 141%.\n\nEach subsequent quarter has seen ever more impressive year-over-year gains for the chip giant. But that party won’t last forever. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported revenue of $26 billion, a 262% increase from the $7.19 billion the company reported in the prior year.\n\nFor its upcoming second quarter report, Wall Street analysts are anticipating revenue of $28.6 billion, a 112% year-over-year jump. And while that still represents an enormous increase in revenue, it’s not as staggering as the growth the company has seen in its previous quarters. And that could turn off some investors.\n\nNvidia is still the AI trade’s bright spot\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia isn’t expected to continue raking in cash, or that Wall Street is down on the company. As of Thursday, 66 analysts had Buy ratings on Nvidia’s stock. Just seven had Hold ratings and only one had a Sell rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s safe to say Wall Street has confidence in the company’s outlook. After all, as UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri pointed out in a recent investor note, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC, which produces Nvidia’s chips, posted strong quarter-over-quarter results in its high-performance computing segment. That should indicate another potentially stellar quarter for Nvidia is in the offing.\n\nNvidia, unlike software companies, also benefits from the fact that its products have a real tangible benefit for its customers now. Hyperscalers are putting the company’s chips to work as fast as they can to develop and power AI models. But AI-powered software is still in a foggy kind of testing phase. Companies are implementing AI enterprise software, but it’s not as though its impact on their employees’ productivity will skyrocket overnight.\n\nWhat’s more, experts say it’ll still take years for AI-powered software like Microsoft’s Copilot or Google’s Gemini to truly pay off for business customers. And while those companies are busy iterating on their products, Nvidia will keep on selling them its hardware.\n\nSo, while the AI trade may have taken a hit over the last month, its biggest winner will continue powering forward.

        "content": "Teradyne Positioned for AI Growth with Strong Robotics and Auto Test Markets, Analyst Upgrades Stock\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C J Muse upgraded Teradyne Inc (NASDAQ:TER) from Neutral to Overweight and a $160 price target.\n\nMuse termed Teradyne one of the sneakier AI plays in semiconductors, adding it to its Top Picks list. He said it has excellent leverage for networking and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and is growing in traction on the Custom Silicon side of the house.\n\nTeradyne is also well-levered to a broader industry recovery given an outsized share in Auto or Industrial test, strong positioning in the robotics market, and a solid exposure in the mobile market, where underutilized capacity has been reallocated to compute over the past few quarters, resulting in a robust setup for capacity builds once demand inevitably recovers, the analyst added.\n\nOver the past five years, Teradyne has essentially traded in line with the SOX and at a slight premium to the front-end equipment suppliers, rerating to a ~20x multiple on average versus a ~15x multiple on average over the prior five years.\n\nHe added that Teradyne has traded more in the 20x-30x range over the past two years, benefiting from multiple expansions across the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe analyst writes that 25x is a more than fair multiple today, with upside potential with a greater appreciation of Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI exposure. Taken together and discounting back, the analyst noted a fair value of $160 today (+22% upside) with a clear path higher after that.\n\nLooking forward, Muse noted a path to $200+ as the discounting mechanism is removed, and the multiple potentially expands as investors seek out AI exposure beyond the core Nvidia, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nGiven the profile of the company’s exposure, scarcity value in AI-leverage, and the path for upside to consensus estimates, Muse expects calendar years 2024 and 2025 EPS tracking to $3.10+ and $5.00+ versus consensus $3.03 and $4.69, and earnings power tracking towards the high end of the company’s target model in calendar year 2026.\n\nPrice Action: TER stock traded higher by 0.93% at $132.96 at the last check on Friday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for TER\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Morgan Stanley Downgrades Overweight Equal-Weight Jan 2022 Morgan Stanley Maintains Overweight Jan 2022 Susquehanna Maintains Positive\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for TER\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTERADYNE (TER): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Teradyne Positioned for AI Growth with Strong Robotics and Auto Test Markets, Analyst Upgrades Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Best of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, META, AMZN)",
        "content": "Last week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\n\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week’s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\n\nLooking back to last week’s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nCan Stocks Continue to Rally?\n\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don’t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\n\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying. The economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\n\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\n\nThus, if we don’t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\n\nStory continues EquityClcck\n\nImage Source: EquityClcck\n\nMETA, AMZN and NVDA Boast Incredible Earnings Growth\n\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\n\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\n\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\n\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\n\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights CME, NVIDIA, Interactive Brokers Group, Robinhood Markets and Block",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 16, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: CME Group Inc.'s CME, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Interactive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD and Block Inc. SQ.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nAccumulate Bitcoin for Long-Term Gains: 5 Stocks in Focus\n\nThe cryptocurrency market suffered a severe blow in the first week of August. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency globally, hit an all-time high of $73,750 on Mar 14. However, the broader market bloodbath last week also saw cryptocurrencies suffering. Consequently, Bitcoin fell to below $55,000.\n\nThis year, Bitcoin gathered momentum after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. The ETFs represent a landmark in Bitcoin's journey, offering both retail and institutional investors a regulated and accessible means to invest in the cryptocurrency. This development not only enhances liquidity but also contributes to price stability.\n\nHowever, the price of Bitcoin saw a steady decline from April. One of the major reasons for the decline in Bitcoin price was the halving event that took place in April. The halving event, which reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half to cap the total supply of Bitcoins at 21 million, typically increases demand and drives up prices. Despite this, Bitcoin saw a significant drop, with its price falling below $59,000.\n\nMeanwhile, following the release of a few weak economic data in July, especially the labor market data, the CME FedWatch currently shows a 100% probability of a 25-basis point interest rate cut in September and a 51.5% chance of a 50-basis point rate cut.\n\nFor November, market participants estimate a 100% probability that the total (year-to-date) rate cut will be 50 basis points and a 62.6% probability that the total rate cut will be 75 basis points. Likewise for December, market participants estimate a 100% probability that the total rate cut will be 75 basis points and a 72.4% probability that the total rate cut will be 1% in 2024.\n\nAt this stage, investors should think from a long-term perspective. The Fed is undoubtedly approaching the end of the higher rate regime. A low interest rate is beneficial to high growth-oriented industries such as technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrency.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, investors should accumulate bitcoin using a buy-on-the-dip strategy. Every dip in the bitcoin price will be a good purchasing point in order to gain handsomely once the Fed's tighter monetary control comes to an end.\n\nStocks in Focus\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five bitcoin-oriented stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2024.\n\nCME Group Inc.'s options give the buyer of the call/put the right to buy/sell cryptocurrency futures contracts at a specific price at some future date. CME offers Bitcoin and ether options based on the exchange's cash-settled standard and micro-Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts.\n\nCME Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 4.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days. CME currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nNVIDIA Corp.is a semiconductor industry giant and one of the biggest success stories of 2023 and 2024. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the NVDA stock usually soars on a booming crypto market. This is because GPUs are pivotal to data centers, artificial intelligence, and the creation of crypto assets.\n\nNVIDIA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100% (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 30 days. NVDA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc. is a global automated electronic broker. IBKR executes, processes and trades in cryptocurrencies. IBKR's commodities futures trading desk also offers customers a chance to trade cryptocurrency futures.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 30 days. IBKR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nRobinhood Markets Inc. operates a financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. HOOD buys and sells Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and other cryptocurrencies using its Robinhood Crypto platform.\n\nRobinhood Markets has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 14% over the last seven days. HOOD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nBlock Inc. is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of the Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin.\r\nIn addition, SQ's decentralized tbd platform allows developers to build decentralized finance applications that run on programmable blockchains. SQ is also one of the largest Bitcoin investors.\n\nBlock has an expected earnings growth rate of 98.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.2% over the last 30 days. SQ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Micron, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 16, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Micron MU, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n2 Stocks to Buy Now on Dip in AI Growth\n\nThe stock market barely budged after July's cool inflation print on Wednesday. The Nasdaq got stuck below its 21-day moving average, which could provide near-term resistance following the rapid rebound off the tech-heavy index's 200-day.\n\nSome Wall Street traders are calling for choppiness over the next few months heading into the presidential election. The stock market might also experience more near-term selling amid increased volatility, coupled with the fact that many tech stocks are up well over 20% YTD.\n\nThankfully, the two biggest market drivers—interest rates and earnings—remain bullish tailwinds, meaning the bulls will likely buy up any significant pullbacks.\n\nToday we explore two great large-cap technology stocks trading at least 30% below their highs that investors might want to buy for long-term upside across artificial intelligence and beyond.\n\nBuy Micron Technology, Inc. Stock, Down 33% from its Peaks?\n\nThe basic pitch: Micron is a semiconductor company benefiting from the AI boom poised to do over 50% sales growth in FY24 and FY25, trading 33% below its all-time highs.\n\nMicron is a memory chip titan, with a growing portfolio of DRAM and NAND offerings. Micron grew alongside the rapid expansion of PCs, smartphones, data centers, and more. Micron also talked about its artificial intelligence growth potential for years. MU is finally in its AI super-cycle.\n\nMU is rolling out chips designed to support the heavy workloads required at AI data centers. Micron is also actively expanding its manufacturing footprint, pumping billions of dollars in capex to build cutting-edge memory fabs in the U.S.\n\nMicron expects the AI arms race will drive record demand for memory chips. MU grew its Q3 FY24 sales (reported in late June) by 82%. AI demand drove 50% sequential data center revenue growth and record high data center revenue mix. Micron expects to post record revenue in FY25, fueled by \"robust AI demand.\"\n\nMU is projected to grow its revenue by 60% in FY24 and another 55% in FY25 to reach $38.63 billion—crushing FY22's $30.76 billion record. On the bottom-line, Micron is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$4.45 per share last year to $1.16 in FY24 and skyrocket 700% in FY25 to reach $9.32 per share.\n\nMicron's FY24 consensus earnings estimate surged 26% since its Q3 release, with FY25's consensus 15% higher. Micron's upbeat EPS outlook helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Micron's robust balance sheet supports its growth efforts and its dividend payout.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron shares doubled the Zacks Tech sector over the past 15 years. MU is also up 42% during the trailing three months to outpace Tech's 20%, including Micron's 33% fall from its June peaks. MU stock's average Zacks price target offers 66% upside from its current price.\n\nMicron stock found support on Wednesday near its previous highs from 2021 and 2022 (see nearby chart). Along with its discounted price, Micron trades at a 55% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and over 60% below its various highs during the last 10 years at 11.6X forward 12-month earnings.\n\nTime to Buy Advanced Micro Devices Stock for Long-Term Upside?\n\nThe basic pitch: Advanced Micro Devices is attempting to gain AI chip market share against its GPU competitor and industry powerhouse Nvidia. AMD, which is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 26% this year and 54% next year, has tumbled over 30% from its March highs.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a standout player in the GPU and CPU industries. AMD's key GPU segment grew alongside the rapid expansion of the gaming industry, data centers, and beyond over the past 10 years. AMD grew its revenue from around $4 billion in FY15 to nearly $23 billion last year.\n\nAMD remains far behind AI chip leader Nvidia. Thankfully, the AI pie is massive and AMD is benefitting immensely from the same AI megatrends as Nvidia. AMD acquired Silo AI—the largest private AI lab in Europe—on August 12 in a $665 million all-cash deal to \"accelerate development and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware.\"\n\nAMD topped our Q2 EPS estimate on July 30. AMD provided slightly downbeat guidance, extending its streak of downward revisions.\n\nStill, AMD is projected to post 13% revenue growth in 2024 and 26% higher sales next year to soar from $22.68 billion in 2023 to $32.18 billion in FY25. Plus, AMD is projected to boost its adjusted earnings by 26% this year and 52% next year.\n\nAMD is going all in on AI to help take advantage of the long-term growth potential. \"The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market, creating significant growth opportunities as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our business,\" CEO Dr. Lisa Su said in prepared remarks.\n\nAMD shares have skyrocketed 3,300% in the past 10 years to destroy Tech's 300% and the Zacks Semiconductor market's 920%. AMD has lagged the chip market over the last three years, with the stock down 5% YTD and 33% from its early March records.\n\nAMD is trying to find support near its 21-month moving average. The stock is also trading at some of its most oversold RSI levels over the past 10 years, while trading between its 21-week and 50-week. Buyers also appear to be trying to prevent AMD from sliding much further below its 2021 highs.\n\nAMD trades at a 45% discount to its five-years highs at 38.5X forward 12-month earnings, putting it right near the Zacks Semiconductor Market. The stock's PEG ratio, which factors in long-term earnings growth, offers a slight discount to Tech and 82% value compared to AMD's recent highs.\n\nAMD might be the Pepsi to Nvidia's Coca-Cola in the AI chip market. But being No. 2 is still a fantastic place to be.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Pre-Markets Drift Lower; July Housing Data Down Sharply",
        "content": "Friday, August 16th, 2024\r\n\r\nIt’s been an eventful week for the stock market — thankfully in a good way. After last week’s near-meltdown, there was palpable fear that the highs of 2024 had already come and gone. And while we haven’t taken out new highs on any of the major indexes, we’re certainly pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis morning, we see a little run-off from the big upswing the past two sessions. The Dow is -55 points and this hour, the S&P 500 -20 and the Nasdaq -95 points. Bond yields on the 10-year and 2-year remain inverted — and the 2-year is now back above 4% slightly — but the longer trend here is still anticipating lower rates.\r\n\r\nFrom now until Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) come out two weeks from this morning, we’ll be relatively dormant on both economic prints and Q2 earnings. NVIDIA NVDA, which reports a week from next Wednesday, while vastly important, exists somewhat on an earnings island unto itself.\n\nHousing Data Shrinks Further in July\n\nThis morning, Housing Starts for July came in beneath expectations. Coming in at only 1.24 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units is the lightest print we’ve seen since way back in May 2020. Expectations had been for 1.34 million new starts, with June’s number revised down from 1.35 million to 1.33 million units.\r\n\r\nBuilding Permits, seen as a proxy for future starts, also was the lowest we’ve seen since the pandemic: 1.40 million is the slimmest figure since June 2020 and below the 1.42 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units. This is below the unrevised June read of 1.45 million.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind these surveys happened around the time Hurricane Debby was bearing down on Florida and elsewhere in the Southeast U.S., where a large portion of new homebuilding business occurs. Now Hurricane Ernesto is busy disrupting construction in the region; late summer is typically a rough time for areas prone to hurricane season.\r\n\r\nAll the downward shift in housing has been on the Single Family side, which fell more than -14% last month. Multi-Family was slightly higher, but with already such abundant supply, we don’t expect this segment to drive new housing in the near future.\r\n\r\nBorrowing costs remained high last month. The silver lining here is that an interest rate cut next month, as expected, would necessarily offer some relief among new housing construction. Not only for borrowing costs for the homebuilders themselves, but in terms of mortgage rates for prospective homebuyers.\r\n\r\nFinally, an antitrust settlement among multi-listing services (MLS) promises to adjust compensation for mortgage brokers, which may lead to lower agent commissions. While professionals in the industry might be expected to feel the brunt of this agreement, it would help further lower lending costs for homebuyers.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "The Nasdaq and tech stocks are poised for significant gains heading into year-end, driven by the accelerating AI revolution, according to a recent note from Wedbush analysts.\n\n\"[The] stage [is] set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end with [the] AI revolution,\" said the firm.\n\nDespite market volatility, growth concerns, and other macroeconomic challenges, Wedbush believes that the tech sector is on the brink of substantial growth, underpinned by the expanding influence of AI.\n\nWedbush highlighted that while there were some \"soft spots\" in recent tech earnings, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s weaker e-commerce guidance and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube ad revenue dip, the overall earnings season was \"generally robust.\"\n\nThis performance, the analysts argue, \"further solidifies the AI tidal wave of spending is coming to the shores of the rest of the tech world.\"\n\nThe firm emphasized the foundational role of cloud and AI technologies in the ongoing \"4th Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nThey state that companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google, and Amazon have demonstrated \"rock solid\" underlying cloud strength, with more enterprises expected to adopt cloud and AI solutions in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nWedbush believes key players like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) have also shown significant AI momentum, further validating this trend.\n\nWedbush also sees Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s upcoming earnings report on August 28th as a critical moment for tech investors. Describing Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang as the \"Godfather of AI,\" they anticipate his insights will showcase the \"massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025.\"\n\nWedbush believes the current AI revolution is akin to the early days of the internet, marking the beginning of a transformative era for tech stocks rather than a speculative bubble. They remain bullish on the sector heading into 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStage is set for Nasdaq, tech stocks to move higher: Wedbush\n\nExclusive-Deutsche Bank's proposed Postbank case settlement offer rejected by plaintiffs\n\nEvergrande onshore unit's administrator seeks details from creditors ahead of meeting\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of +133.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +106.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +25.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $28.24 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +109%. For the current and next fiscal years, $117.82 billion and $152.66 billion estimates indicate +93.4% and +29.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Google’s ex-CEO isn’t licensed to give financial advice, but he thinks you should buy Nvidia",
        "content": "Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google until 2011, is many things, but one thing he is not is a financial advisor licensed to provide investment advice. If he were, however, he made it pretty clear that AI training chip vendor Nvidia is a stock he thinks belongs in every portfolio.\n\nSpeaking to Stanford University students this week, the billionaire angel investor argued that the race to commercialize generative artificial intelligence and other forms of AI was still in its early stage. Even though the easy money might have already been made, in his opinion, there’s still plenty of upside potential in the space.\n\nThat’s particularly true for Nvidia, whose head start in graphic processing units (GPUs) like the benchmark H100, combined with its dominant software ecosystem CUDA, gives it an enormous lead as a data center’s supplier of choice for AI training chips.\n\n“The amount of money being thrown around is mind-boggling,” Schmidt told students. “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me that they need $10 billion, $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion.”\n\nSchmidt added that OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman even believes it will take $300 billion to develop artificial general intelligence, a machine capable of reasoning on its own.\n\n“If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt continued, before quickly adding: “That’s not a stock recommendation, I’m not licensed.”\n\nAMD cannot compete yet with Nvidia's dominant CUDA software\n\nNvidia shares have been the primary beneficiary of the AI gold rush, with its stock nearly tripling this year to hit $135 by mid-July. That has been driven in part by debt-funded “carry” trades, a momentum play where investors borrow in cheap Japanese yen to invest in higher yielding, dollar-denominated U.S. growth stocks.\n\nWith the recent sharp rise in Japan’s currency over the greenback, shares have pulled back from their highs when the company’s $3.3 trillion market cap briefly made it more valuable than any other company in the world.\n\nYet Nvidia still has a chance to mark fresh highs should it smash earnings expectations when it reports quarterly results at the end of this month.\n\nJudging by Schmidt’s conversations with his contacts at Big Tech, he certainly expects demand for its AI training chips to remain robust, if not exponential.\n\nReferring to Percy Liang, a Stanford AI researcher, who has had to resort to Google’s tensor processors (TPUs) due to a lack of availability of Nvidia chips, Schmidt said: “If he had infinite money he would pick the B200 architecture.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe B200 is Nvidia’s next-generation training chip. It is so advanced even its packaging has to be done in the controlled conditions of a clean room, not just the creation of the wafer itself, according to Schmidt.\n\nWhile Lisa Su’s AMD may one day catch up on hardware, he said her company’s software ecosystem doesn’t have the user base of Nvidia, and a compiler to translate CUDA into AMD’s own programming language ROCm to aid developers doesn’t yet work.\n\nNeither Nvidia nor AMD could immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAI skeptic Ken Griffin slashes hedge fund Citadel's exposure to Nvidia\n\nStanford took down the video following criticism leveled at Schmidt after he blamed his former employer blowing its head start on AI on a lackadaisical work ethic that enabled its staff to work from home rather than the office.\n\nGoogle researchers invented in 2017 the so-called transformer neural network that powers most GenAI models, only to “then put it on the shelf,” as Marc Andreessen put it last month. The very name of OpenAI’s own ChatGPT—\"generative pre-trained transformer\"—that launched in late 2022 reveals its Google ancestry.\n\nSchmidt didn’t comment on what kind of time horizon he had for his investment recommendations. It’s safe to say, though, that as an angel investor funding various startups, it’s longer than the average on Wall Street.\n\nThis was evident, for example, in a filing this week from Citadel. Ken Griffin’s hedge fund has slashed its holdings in Nvidia by two-thirds to $19 million at the end of June after selling about half a million shares. Last month Griffin told his firm’s new class of potential talent he doubted GenAI would be as revolutionary as others believe.\n\nSchmidt, whose net worth doesn’t quite match Griffin's but is still estimated at nearly $24 billion, told Stanford students he takes a less targeted approach when shopping for the next AI leader: “I essentially invest in everything, because I can’t figure out who’s going to win.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Sell-Off: Is It Time to Be Concerned?",
        "content": "I'm a longtime Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) bull. But even I'm concerned about what's happening with Nvidia stock right now.\n\nConsider this: Nvidia's stock has experienced its first 20% drawdown since the start of 2023. NVDA Chart\n\nIn other words, the market finally found a gap in Nvidia's armor. Sure, Nvidia has already bounced off its lows and could recover and make new highs, but is it time to worry that Nvidia's flawless longer-term bull run is coming to an end? Let's dive in and see. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat's happening with Nvidia?\n\nSince reaching an all-time high of $140.76 in June, Nvidia shares fell by 27%. That may not seem like all that much. Yet, bear in mind, at its peak, Nvidia boasted a market cap of more than $3.2 trillion -- making it briefly the world's largest public company.\n\nDuring its drawdown, it shed more than $650 billion in value -- roughly equivalent to the total market cap of Tesla, America's 10th-largest company.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia's recent sell-off is a big deal. And not just because of the value it has lost -- after all, that could be recovered in a similarly short amount of time. No, the bigger concerns are why Nvidia dropped so steeply and whether it could have been the result of fundamental weakness for the company and its stock.\n\nLet's see what the numbers say.\n\nTale of the tape: How does Nvidia measure up?\n\nIt's true: Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed over the last few years. So, let's boil down what's behind that success. In my opinion, it comes down to two key factors:\n\nRising sales Rising expectations of future sales\n\nTo put it another way, Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed because its revenue is way up, and expectations of its future revenue keep increasing, too. So, can that continue?\n\nIf you look at Nvidia's revenue over the past two years, it's easy to see why its stock has exploded higher. The company has roughly tripled its revenue from $25 billion/year to over $75 billion/year on the back of massive graphics processing unit (GPU) sales -- the \"brains\" behind artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nBut that's not the only reason for the stock's success. Along with this massive revenue growth, investors have been willing to pay far more for each dollar in revenue based on increased expectations of future revenue growth. That's why Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio has also risen. In 2022, it bottomed under 10 times. However, just a few weeks ago, Nvidia's P/S ratio was an astonishing 42 times. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThe only way to explain this change is that investors expect Nvidia's sales to grow -- rapidly. Indeed, analysts expect Nvidia to double its sales to nearly $120 billion this year. However, this is where concerns begin to bubble up.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat if those same analysts temper their expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth or, even worse, begin to lower those sales estimates? That would call into question the massive valuation premium investors have been paying (as represented by Nvidia's P/S ratio) and, in turn, result in another significant sell-off in the stock.\n\nFor some answers about whether this is possible, let's examine this chart, which shows how Wall Street analysts have adjusted their revenue estimates over the last three years. NVDA Revenue Estimates for 2 Quarters Ahead, 30 Day % Change ChartNVDA Revenue Estimates for 2 Quarters Ahead, 30 Day % Change data by YCharts\n\nThis chart shows how much analysts have adjusted their estimates of Nvidia's future revenue (two quarters away) over the last 30 days. Peaks represent large increases (good for the stock); valleys represent decreases (bad for the stock).\n\nAs you can see, there have been far more peaks than valleys over the last two years. However, those peaks have been decreasing in size. That means that with each quarterly report, analysts have been closer to matching Nvidia's sales guidance. In other words, Wall Street's expectations are starting to catch up to reality. If that trend holds, those factors should reach equilibrium, then perhaps reverse -- company guidance may fall below expectations, and analysts will have to cut their revenue forecasts, resulting in valleys on this chart and a falling share price for Nvidia.\n\nWhat's the takeaway for investors?\n\nTo sum it up, Nvidia's stock has been on a rocket ride for almost two years. Similarly, its sales and sales expectations have taken off, too. Yet, those high expectations have also driven up its stock valuation. In turn, the stock is highly vulnerable to a sharp downturn. Investors should be cautious with Nvidia stock. Even though the company remains well positioned for the long term, volatility in the short term means the stock is not a good match for some investment portfolios right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

See below:\n\nCharter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR): +19.72% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY): +15.48% Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE): +14.80% F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV): +14% Pool Corporation (NASDAQ:POOL): +13.64% Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH): +12.99% PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL): +11.60% Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH): +11.60% Frontdoor (NASDAQ:FTDR): +11.50% YETI Holdings (NYSE:YETI): +10.60%\n\n(*percentages refer to the two trading days that followed the report)\n\nAmong several others!\n\nOur state-of-the-art AI tool picked these stocks over the three monthly updates that encompassed the Q2 earnings season, all of them BEFORE they reported earnings.\n\nNow, given the highly positive financial backdrop presented by these companies, several of them are likely to continue to gain in the months ahead, especially if the economy continues to avoid a recession.\n\nHowever, others may just have passed their prime and have now become hard sells.\n\nWant to find out which?See here which stocks stayed in our August list and which have been removed.\n\nUnlike other models, our AI identifies undervalued names before they become too expensive. Instead of relying solely on momentum models, our approach integrates decades of comprehensive stock market fundamental and technical analysis of a multitude of data sets.\n\nBut hold on, there's even more:\n\nAmong the companies that reported inside one of our strategies, nearly 30% rallied by more than 5% afterward, with more than 20% rallying by 10% or more.\n\nThese results have propelled our strategies to significantly outperform the market since our official launch in November last year (as of today's premarket figures):\n\nTech Titans: +75.61% Top Value: 37.86% S&P 500: 28.52%\n\nStory continues\n\nThese numbers are no backtest; they represent real-world performance, unfolded in real time to our users' benefit.\n\nThat's why savvy investors looking to beat the market are following our AI's monthly updates, keeping up-to-date with the best stocks to buy and sell for each month.\n\nIn fact, our backtest suggests that going for the long run will give you even heftier gains.

        "content": "Warren Buffett once famously said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" With that in mind, here are three tech stocks investors should consider piling into while others have become fearful.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have sold off recently on concern about increasing competition in search as well as a court ruling that the company's Google search engine is a monopoly.\n\nAlthough Alphabet has been found guilty of antitrust practices, a final resolution to the court ruling and what remedies are put in place will likely take quite some time to be implemented. It wouldn't be surprising if it stretches out into 2026. The court ruling focused mainly on the company's payments to smartphone makers to be the exclusive default search engine of their mobile devices, so there will likely be changes to these agreements.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have become worried about the financial effect artificial intelligence (AI) will have on Google's business model as well as what impact AI-powered search engines from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity will have on the company.\n\nBoth of these issues look more than manageable. First, Alphabet has started to innovate on the search front not just through AI, but with features such as visual search and circle to search. The former lets users conduct a search using the smartphone's camera, while the latter lets users circle or even scribble on an image or text to get more information about a subject, without leaving an app.\n\nWith Alphabet's decades of data, a brand synonymous with internet search, a business that throws off huge cash flow, and new monetization opportunities stemming from AI, it will not be easy for a money-losing, sub-scale competitor to make any meaningful inroads into Google's search dominance. While the court ruling likely will make it easier for users to switch default search engines, the company has about two years to make sure not many people will want to by further increasing its technological lead in search.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 19, the stock is a bargain given the growth opportunities in front of it. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, sold off earlier this summer on news of tougher export restrictions on semiconductors to China, as well as comments from presidential candidate Donald Trump claiming that Taiwan had taken 100% of the chip business from the U.S. and that it should pay for its own military.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough there are certainly geopolitical risks when it comes to investing in TSMC, given Taiwan's importance to chip manufacturing and the havoc it would cause if there was a disruption, these risks are likely overblown. Meanwhile, as the leading semiconductor contract manufacturer in the world, the company is set to continue to nicely benefit from the buildout of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe company's revenue rose nearly 33% year over year in Q2 to $20.8 billion, while it recently reported that it had its best sales month ever in July, with revenue rising 45% in the month. The company has been expanding production to meet high demand, and is expected to raise prices by as much as 10% next year for some smaller nodes. This should lead to some very nice growth next year.\n\nTrading at a 20 times forward P/E based on 2025 analyst estimates, the stock is too cheap to ignore given its growth outlook. TSM PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart Image source: Getty Images.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nAfter a strong run, shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have pulled back on worries the stock has run too far too fast and that there would be delays for its newest Blackwell chip. While the latter is probably true, demand for its chips is so high that it likely will have only a minimal impact on its results, as customers continue to scoop up its current-generation Hopper chips instead.\n\nAlthough there is some worry that AI infrastructure spending could slow, the commentary from the the major companies involved in the AI buildout all point to increased investments ahead. At this point, the worry among customers is not overbuilding capacity, but not building enough capacity. Meanwhile, the more advanced large language models (LLMs) become, the more computing power they will need.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms recently said its Llama 4 LLM would likely need 10 times the computing power to train compared to Llama 3. That means the need for a lot more graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia.\n\nWith demand not letting up, Nvidia's stock looks inexpensive trading at under 30 times next year's earnings consensus. This looks like a great time to buy the dip.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Isn't the Top Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock, According to the \"Dean of Valuation.\" Here's What He Says Is.",
        "content": "If I had to pick one reason to invest in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) right now, it would be the company's growth prospects fueled by artificial intelligence (AI). Many investors would no doubt agree with me.\n\nBut not all of them. Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University often called the \"Dean of Valuation,\" disagrees. AI isn't the top reason to buy Nvidia stock, according to Damodaran. However, he thinks another factor could be.\n\nHas Damodaran changed his mind about Nvidia?\n\nEarlier this year, Damodaran posted in X (the app formerly known as Twitter) that Nvidia \"is a bridge too far for me.\" He added that he had halved his position in the stock in the summer of 2023 and was doing so again.\n\nDamodaran built a model to value all the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. He calculated the fair value of Nvidia was $436.34 per share. This was before the company's 10-for-1 stock split, so his fair value translates to $43.63 after the split.\n\nNvidia is now nearly 2.7 times higher than Damodaran's fair value. Has the \"Dean of Valuation\" changed his mind about the stock? Not really.\n\nDamodaran still views Nvidia as too expensive to buy. However, he recently offered a hypothetical reason why the stock might be worth buying for some investors.\n\nWhat could justify buying Nvidia right now\n\nNiels Kaastrup-Larsen interviewed Damodaran for his \"Top Traders Unplugged\" podcast earlier this month. When the subject of Nvidia arose, the NYU professor offered an interesting take.\n\nDamodaran said that AI doesn't justify Nvidia's market cap of close to $3 trillion. Instead, he said, \"It's the expectation that Nvidia will find another business out there that is big and be a first mover there.\"\n\nNvidia has a pretty good track record on this front. Damodaran told Kaastrup-Larsen, \"It's a company that's managed to find new markets and jump into them ahead of everybody else. It did it with gaming. It did it with crypto. It did it with AI.\"\n\nWhy doesn't Damodaran think AI will provide enough growth potential to justify buying the stock at the current price? He explained, \"Even if you believe the Goldman Sachs numbers for AI being a $3 trillion business or a $4 trillion business, the architecture for AI, which is what Nvidia provides, can't be more than a half a trillion of that. And that's actually larger than any of the predictions I've seen for how high the AI chip business has going.\"\n\nNvidia's potential new markets\n\nLet's assume Damodaran is right. What new markets could Nvidia enter to make the stock a great pick now? Several possibilities come to mind, many of which the company is already targeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor example, quantum computing could represent a huge opportunity within a few years. The metaverse is another possibility.\n\nHowever, I think Nvidia's greatest potential is in AI -- but an expansion of AI beyond what's available now. Some experts think artificial general intelligence (AGI) could be developed by the end of this decade. Robotaxis using AI technology could become a massive market within a few years. Edge AI -- running AI models on devices locally instead of in the cloud -- could be a key opportunity for Nvidia, especially with consumer devices such as smartphones and smart glasses.\n\nWhat Damodaran is talking about is called optionality. Nvidia could have lots of optionality in the future. The \"Dean of Valuation\" isn't confident enough in the company's ability to capitalize on its opportunities to buy the stock. But for those investors who are, Nvidia's current pullback could present a great buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "With shares down 14% from an all-time high of $136 hit two months ago, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rocketship rally seems to be unraveling, even as revenue and earnings continue to hit new records. While the chipmaker is still arguably one of the best companies in the world, the market may be losing excitement about the artificial intelligence (AI) industry in general.\n\nLet's explore the pros and cons of the current situation to decide whether investors should buy the dip or avoid this declining stock.\n\nWhy is Nvidia declining?\n\nThe truth is that no stock can continue rising at a parabolic rate forever. After gaining over 600% since the start of 2023, Nvidia was due for a pullback. That said, some emerging macroeconomic challenges could eventually spell fundamental trouble for the high-flying company.\n\nAnalysts at J.P. Morgan think the U.S. economy has a 35% chance of entering a recession by the end of the year. A downturn could wreak havoc on Nvidia's business model, because its high-end AI graphics processing units (GPUs) are essentially tech sector luxury items.\n\nFor starters, these chips are expensive, with Nvidia's H100 costing between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. Thousands of these units are needed to train and run large language models (LLMs). The industry is also notoriously difficult to monetize because of high competition, weak competitive moats, and technical limitations. Corporations would most likely slash their investments in this speculative sector during a recession.\n\nNvidia faces increasingly challenging comparisons\n\nIf Nvidia has anything, it's a spectacular growth rate. First-quarter revenue soared 262% year over year to $26 billion, powered by sales of the company's most advanced data center chips like the H100. Most importantly, these products boast high margins, which allowed Nvidia to increase its operating profit by almost 700% to $16.9 billion.\n\nHowever, a stock's performance is typically based on future expectations, not past performance. It's unclear how Nvidia will manage to top these already breathtaking results, especially without a substantial breakthrough on the consumer-facing software side of the AI industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe company's remarkably high gross margin of 78.4% also suggests it is selling its products at an unsustainable markup over the cost of producing them. This dynamic is sure to draw attention from suppliers like TSMC, which announced plans to raise its production fees in 2025. And while Nvidia is successfully keeping the competition at bay through its rapid update cycle, there is no guarantee that the company can maintain its deep economic moat forever.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe valuation might be unsustainable\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 40, Nvidia doesn't look expensive compared to its astronomical growth rate. For context, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices trades for the same multiple despite only growing sales by 9% in its most recent quarter (Nvidia grew 262%).\n\nThat said, Nvidia's business model has become incredibly overexposed to AI hardware demand, making it tied to a very speculative industry that isn't backed by a track record of revenue and profits. Increasingly difficult comps will also make it harder for the company to sustain its current levels of growth over the coming years.\n\nAll in all, Nvidia stock isn't horrible, and most of the near-term downside might already be priced in. However, I would like to see more progress on the consumer side of the AI industry before buying this dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Dumping Shares of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Nvidia for a Third Straight Quarter -- Here's Why",
        "content": "The most important data release of the quarter occurred earlier this week -- and I'm not talking about the much-anticipated July inflation report.\n\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers an under-the-hood glimpse of which stocks Wall Street's smartest, most-successful, and richest investors have been buying and selling.\n\nDespite the limitations of 13Fs -- e.g., they can be 45 days old when filed, meaning the data you're seeing might be stale for active fund managers -- they provide invaluable clues as to what stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's brightest asset managers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile there's been plenty of buying and selling activity for companies involved in what's currently the buzziest investment opportunity, artificial intelligence (AI), the theme for the latest round of 13Fs is that Wall Street's billionaire investors are continuing to pare down their stakes in AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia has become the hardware backbone of the artificial intelligence movement\n\nSince the page was turned to 2023, shares of Nvidia have catapulted higher by 709%, as of the closing bell on Aug. 14, which translates into an increase in market cap of more than $2.5 trillion. Quite a few billionaire investors and their funds have benefited immensely from this move higher.\n\nThe catalyst behind this historic gain for a market-leading business is the company's data-center hardware. More specifically, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has become the brains powering the split-second decision-making needed in enterprise data centers running generative AI solutions and training large language models. In 2023, Nvidia's chips had a near-monopoly (98% share) of the GPUs shipped to data centers, per TechInsights.\n\nThe beauty of having an in-demand product is the exceptional pricing power that usually comes with it. With demand for the H100 outstripping supply, Nvidia has been able to increase the selling price of its AI-GPU to between $30,000 and $40,000. The end result being a big uptick in the company's adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut not all money managers believe Wall Street's AI leader has enough gas left in the proverbial tank to deliver for investors.\n\nBillionaire money managers sold shares of Nvidia for a third consecutive quarter\n\nAccording to newly filed 13Fs on Aug. 14, seven prominent billionaire asset managers were sellers of Nvidia's stock during the June-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (9,282,018 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,730,000 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (1,545,370 shares) Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management (1,360,215 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (676,242 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (409,042 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (96,963 shares)\n\nDuring the March quarter, eight billionaire investors -- nine, if you include Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies, who passed away in May -- sent shares of Nvidia to the chopping block, while eight select billionaires were also sellers in the December-ended quarter.\n\nAlthough profit-taking following a monstrous run higher is a logical explanation behind this billionaire investor exodus, there are close to a half-dozen other factors that may shed more light on why money managers keep heading for the exit. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive reasons billionaires can't stop selling shares of Nvidia\n\nHistory might just be the clearest reason billionaires are steadily heading to the sideline. Every next-big-thing technology and trend over the last 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble.\n\nPut another way, investor expectations with regard to adoption and utility have far exceeded reality for every buzzy innovation or trend over the last three decades. With most businesses lacking a well-defined blueprint as to how they'll generate a positive return on their AI investments, it's looking likely that AI is the next in a long line of next-big-thing bubbles. If the AI bubble bursts, no stock would, arguably, be hit harder than Nvidia.\n\nThe expectation for a meaningful increase in competition is another reason billionaires may be showing shares of Nvidia to the door. Given AI's massive addressable market, a number of external competitors are entering the picture with AI-GPUs of their own.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales are internally developing AI chips for their data centers. These complementary chips will minimize the \"real estate\" in high-compute data centers for Nvidia's hardware.\n\nThirdly, billionaires are wisely not overlooking the ceiling that regulators have put in place. In 2022, and again in 2023, U.S. regulators imposed export restrictions to China for Nvidia's high-powered AI chips. Following the first round of restrictions in 2022, Nvidia developed the toned-down H800 and A800 chips for the world's No. 2 economy. Unfortunately, these GPUs were added to the export restriction list last year. These restrictions may cost Nvidia billions of dollars in quarterly sales. NVDA Shares Sold By Insiders Chart\n\nA fourth catalyst behind this ongoing selling by billionaires might have to do with the lack of buying we've witnessed from company insiders. There hasn't been an open-market purchase of Nvidia stock from an executive or board member since December 2020. Meanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has been selling his company's stock hand over fist since mid-June.\n\nWhile not all insider selling is bad news -- some sales may be done for tax purposes -- a complete lack of buying activity suggests none of Nvidia's higher-ups believe shares are a good value.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's valuation is an eyesore.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\n\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\n\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\n\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won’t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\n\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\n\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\n\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\n\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands to gain substantially from the surging demand for AI, particularly as more companies and researchers invest in AI development. The continuous growth in AI training within data centers is the main force driving NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s revenue.\n\nAlthough AI technology is expected to advance significantly over the next decade, the current demand already signals a strong outlook for NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s business. UBS analysts anticipate a 27% increase in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) from its current $118 price, which would raise its forward price-to-earnings ratio to 54, indicating strong confidence in Nvidia's future growth.\n\nJim Cramer emphasizes that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s CEO, Jensen Wong, has been confidently stating that purchasing Nvidia chips could potentially quadruple returns. He stresses that this isn't a mere speculation but a reality, and questions how much anyone has actually gained by betting against Wong's predictions over the years.\n\n\"Nvidia's Jensen Wong has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Wong?\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\" Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:135\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), the world's leading semiconductor foundry, dominates the global market with over 50% share, making it a crucial supplier to major tech companies like\n\nApple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL),\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA), and\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMD). Its cutting-edge technology, including 5nm and 3nm chips, keeps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ahead of competitors and ensures consistent demand for its products.\n\nTo manage geopolitical risks and meet increasing global demand, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its manufacturing operations beyond Taiwan, with significant investments in the U.S. and Japan. This strategic move is reflected in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s strong financial performance, with recent revenue reaching $20.82 billion and earnings per share at $1.48, both surpassing expectations.\n\nWhen asked if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is a good long-term buy, Jim Cramer responded positively, saying it’s a solid investment despite ongoing concerns about Taiwan.\n\n\"I think you're fine. I think that there's always going to be a worry about Taiwan. I think that if you go back to what Lisa Su said, she didn't tell you not to worry about it because nobody says that. She says, you know, this one is not going to be a problem, and I'm with her\". Cramer said.\n\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Unsurprisingly the portfolio’s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) and Alphabet. While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\n\nWhile this positioning is painful in the short-term, we see considerable embedded value in our portfolio. We also see considerable risks and uncertainties existing in the AI theme that are not reflected in the Value Latency on offer in many stocks that have surged.\n\nReturning to the AI story, today the portfolio has around 10% of capital invested across TSMC and Alphabet. We think TSMC has a tremendous opportunity to extract more value from the profit pool currently being enjoyed by its downstream customers.”\n\nOverall TSM ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 124\n\nJim Cramer emphasized that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is not just competing with Nvidia; it is dominating the market. According to Cramer, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is capturing a substantial portion of the market, far surpassing\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)'s high-end chip offerings.\n\n\"This is not the Intel of old, even though we want it to be. ...AMD isn't nipping at their heels. AMD is dominating. It's actually taking gobs of market share.\"\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is increasingly attractive due to several key factors. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a strong reputation in gaming, with its GPUs and CPUs being popular among gamers and video editors. This success is evident from a 49% year-over-year rise in CPU sales.\n\nOver the past decade, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has surged nearly 5,000%, reflecting impressive long-term growth. Revenue and operating income have also skyrocketed, up 312% and 169%, respectively. As Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Pinterest Inc’s (NYSE:PINS) ranks 9th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nPinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 64\n\nElliott Management owns a $1.2 billion stake in Pinterest as of the end of June, latest data shows.\n\nPinterest Inc’s (NYSE:PINS) biggest strength and moat is its unique niche audience and the fact that it’s playing on its own turf instead of competing with giants like TikTok or Facebook. Over 500 million active users turn to Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) every month with a clear intention: get inspiration for ideas and buy stuff online for their home or office.  Women make up two-thirds of Pinterest’s user base, and over 40% are Gen Z, the fastest-growing cohort. The company has taken several steps to better monetize its audience. Since 2023, they’ve enhanced click-through rates, with 97% of lower funnel revenue coming from direct links, more than 80% previously. Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) API initiative for third-party integration is also working, with a whopping 40% of revenue coming from that step. The company talked about this during Q1 earnings call:\n\n“One of our most important initiatives began in earnest in 2023 with our efforts to increase adoption of the API for conversions, which provides a server-to-server connection for advertisers to measure and attribute conversions. I’m pleased to report that we’ve grown the adoption of the API to nearly 40% of total revenue, up from 28% of total revenue at our investor day last September.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned previously, revenue from retail advertisers who have adopted the API for conversions tends to grow significantly faster than revenue from those who have not yet adopted. This trend continued to hold in Q1 and underscores our desire to drive more privacy-centric measurement, particularly to lower funnel advertisers where it’s most impactful. We’re seeing a reinforcing effect take place. As advertisers adopt and see the benefits of shopping ads, mobile deep linking, or direct links, they are more incentivized to adopt our privacy-centric measurement.”\n\nAnalysts believe Pinterest’s partnership with Amazon will also boost Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS) revenue. This year the partnership is expected to bring in about $120 million of incremental revenue.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\nPinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) is a social media platform that enables visual discovery and generates revenue mainly through online advertising and e-commerce. Earnings declined after the company saw tremendous user and revenue growth in 2020- 2021 and grew operating expenses as if the pandemic-fueled growth trajectory would continue. Normalized growth trends and a macro slowdown that affected ad spend eventually hurt earnings per share. We believed that Pinterest had a significant opportunity to resume earnings growth because:\n\nPinterest’s stock performed well in the quarter as the thesis played out and the company reported strong results while raising 2023 guidance. We pared back our position during the quarter due to stock appreciation and as the investment becomes less contrarian as our thesis plays out.”\n\nOverall, Pinterest Inc’s (NYSE:PINS) ranks 9th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Pinterest Inc’s (NYSE:PINS), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PINS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple is an important part of the Mag. 7 group which Elliott Management is bearish on.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI initiative Apple Intelligence has started to make sense to Wall Street analysts. Recently, Baird raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $200, citing a potential upgrade cycle in iPhone because of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\n\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) the Best AI Semiconductor Stock According to Cathie Wood?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 8th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCathie Wood’s flagship fund is continuing to face steep losses amid a broader pullback in technology stocks. Wood’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\n\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\n\nCathie Wood Says “Something Is Changing” and the Fed is Now on “High Alert”\n\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a latest video on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a “cathartic” phase and “something is changing.”\n\n“I do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.”\n\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\n“Interest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.”\n\nCathie Wood’s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter. For this article we scanned the fund’s latest portfolio and picked 11 AI stocks it has positions in. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Cathie Wood’s Favorite AI Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nCathie Wood’s Latest Stake Value: $38,411,004\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore said while he likes AMD’s story, he sees “limited upward revision potential for AI from here and we move to EW, with a preference for NVDA and AVGO among large cap AI semis.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Wall Street Just Got Its Most Volatile ETF as Risky Bets Boom",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- In a part of the US market for exchange-traded funds that has become known for increasingly risky products, a new offering has debuted that stands out in the crowd.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nDefiance, a $1.4 billion asset manager, on Thursday launched the Defiance Daily Target 1.75X Long MSTR ETF under the ticker MSTX. The fund looks to offer daily leveraged returns on MicroStrategy Inc. The stock, which has been seen as a Bitcoin proxy because of the company’s holdings of the digital token, has a 90-day volatility of about 97%. That would likely make the new ETF the most volatile in the US, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nFor comparison, the same volatility measure comes in at 66% for Tesla Inc. — another stock prone to sizable swings — and 63% for Nvidia Corp., data compiled by Bloomberg show. For SPY, the giant State Street fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index, it’s 14%.\n\nMSTX is the latest entry in what’s become a robust roster of ETFs that use derivatives to offer juiced-up or inverse returns on single companies. As stocks roared higher for much of 2024, these funds have boomed in popularity, attracting billions of dollars and an array of issuers and new products. But investors in MSTX will potentially face the sharpest swings of them all, says BI’s Eric Balchunas.\n\n“We’re currently in a hot-sauce arms race as more and more issuers look to push the envelope on volatility because there is a market for it,” he said, referring to a moniker he gives riskier funds.\n\nLeveraged single-stock ETFs debuted two years ago, even as US Securities and Exchange Commission officials sounded the alarm on them, particularly for retail investors. While the funds offer a way to tap volatility, they can also compound losses. And though SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the products “present particular risk,” assets in single-stock ETFs have nearly doubled in each of the past two quarters and are currently around $8.5 billion, BI estimates.\n\n“Leveraged funds tend to be used by tactical traders that understand that these funds may or may not come with heightened volatility,” said Sylvia Jablonski, the chief executive officer of Defiance.\n\nThe industry offers funds for all manner of assets, strategies and themes, and companies have been introducing ever-more-complex products to lure cash in a crowded field. Many are also able to charge more for the products given that larger competitors that typically charge less for their ETFs aren’t participating in leveraged and inverse funds, according to BI.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more from BI: ETFs’ Hot-Sauce Arms Race to Serve Up Most Volatile US Fund Ever\n\n“Leverage single-stock products have clearly struck a chord with the trading crowd,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. “Vanilla equity is a high hurdle to attract flows, so this is a new frontier, especially for smaller issuers trying to make a dent in the industry.”\n\n‘Massive Magnet’\n\nEye-popping returns from the likes of T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) — which have earned 330% and 290% in 2024, respectively — have caught investors’ attention. Assets in NVDL, for instance, have soared to $5 billion, from around $200 million to start the year. That growth has inspired other issuers to try their luck.\n\n“It has become a massive magnet for all kinds of experimental products to be launched,” said Balchunas. “NVDL charges 1.15% — you just need one hit like this to be set for life.”\n\nFor investors, a wrong-way bet can be extra painful. While NVDX and NVDL are the top-performing ETFs this year, three inverse Nvidia funds also top the list of worst performers, with losses of more than 70% each. The T-Rex 2X Inverse NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDQ) is down 90% this year, the worst record for a US ETF in the entire 3,600-fund universe.\n\n“There is a reason why the front page of this fund’s prospectus is covered with disclosure in black bold print,” Amrita Nandakumar, president of Vident Asset Management, said of the new MicroStrategy fund. “As an industry, we have a responsibility to ensure that investors understand that funds such as these are meant to be short-term trading vehicles and not long-term investments.”\n\nMicroStrategy became popular with retail investors in recent years thanks to its bets on Bitcoin. The firm’s CEO has said the digital asset was a better investment for the enterprise-software company’s cash than traditional staples such as short-term Treasuries.\n\nDefiance — which is known for its thematic offerings — also recently launched a double-leverage Eli Lilly ETF. It also manages some options-income products and is hoping to introduce a 2x fund based on Broadcom Inc. in the coming days. It has also shuttered some offerings, including the Defiance Treasury Alternative Yield ETF, which it closed last month.\n\n--With assistance from Katie Greifeld.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "NVDA, SNOW, BIDU: 3 “Strong Buy” Tech Stocks to Consider on Weakness",
        "content": "The plunge in technology stocks seems to be reversing course in record time. Still, there are Strong-Buy-rated tech stocks that still haven’t participated in the relief rally enjoyed by most names in the last few sessions. With the confidence of Wall Street analysts and a number of catalysts, the following trio — NVDA, SNOW, and BIDU — deserve a spot atop one’s shopping list before August comes to a close.\n\nTherefore, let’s examine each name using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to determine which highly rated tech stock is the best of the bunch.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares of top AI company Nvidia are moving higher again as a number of analysts recommended buying the latest dip for a shot at a glorious rebound. Given the pace of NVDA stock’s gains, we may very well be looking at higher highs before the third quarter concludes. I’m staying bullish on the stock, primarily because Nvidia didn’t do anything unforgivable to deserve the recent beatdown.\n\nWhile mild Blackwell production delays due to minor design errors may be a slight hair on an otherwise flawless generational growth story, I find that NVDA stock crumbled mostly due to a rapid shift in sentiment. Every once in a while, fear and anxiety take hold on Wall Street, causing some to sell for no real good reason other than shares falling.\n\nIn around two weeks’ time (August 28, 2024), Nvidia’s next quarterly earnings will be on tap. While expectations will be high, some analysts, like those at Bank of America (BAC), believe that recent ROI (return on investment) jitters of investors are “premature and inconclusive.”\n\nNo hyper-growth company can keep at it for the long haul, especially one that’s worth a few trillion dollars. That said, it’s really hard to tell just where we stand in the AI boom. If it’s a multi-year boom (the likeliest timeframe in my view) that entails upgrading every year to the latest chip (Nvidia’s Blackwell line next year, then Rubin), the doubters could continue to be wrong about the stock.\n\nBank of America will probably be proven right in that it’s far too soon in the game to shift gears from thinking about full-on growth and market share gains to ROI. The good news is that investors are staying skeptical and demanding more on the profitability front early on in the game. This skepticism may very well be what prevents AI stocks from becoming a bubble. At around 44 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I just don’t see a bubble in the name unless you think Blackwell and Rubin will flop.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVDA stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 37 Buys and four Holds assigned in the past three months. The average NVDA stock price target of $144.17 implies 22.1% upside potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)\n\nSnowflake is probably one of the most hated cloud and AI software stocks on the market right now. With Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) selling its small SNOW position in the last quarter, there’s just one more big reason to cut one’s losses with the data warehousing and AI infrastructure company. Nonetheless, I’m inclined to stay bullish as Snowflake still stands out as one of the most compelling software ways to play the AI boom.\n\nFurther, the firm’s AI tech and talent seem severely underrated by investors who want to see results today without having to wait for them. As the Buffett sale and association with cyber breaches at AT&T (T) act as overhangs going into the coming quarter (due on August 21, 2024), there’s never been a better time to step in as a contrarian.\n\nApart from its fantastic slate of AI-enabling products (Cortex and Arctic), the company has also been active in exploring acquisitions and partnerships to further bolster its AI capabilities. Recently, Snowflake mulled a potential partnership with private Canadian AI firm Cohere. Such a deal could be a huge win for both companies. Cohere is a lesser-known AI firm seeking to take on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, while Snowflake is hunting down Databricks in the cloud scene.\n\nIf Snowflake can team up with Cohere or buy the company (valued at $5.5 billion in its most recent funding round) outright, the firm may just be able to reverse and gain ground after shedding 68% of its value since its 2021 peak.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for SNOW Stock?\n\nSNOW stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 25 Buys and eight Holds assigned in the past three months. The average SNOW stock price target of $200.97 implies 57.8% upside potential.\n\nSee more SNOW analyst ratings\n\nBaidu (BIDU)\n\nBaidu is one Chinese internet firm that Dr. Michael Burry (from The Big Short) has been buying shares of in recent quarters. At writing, BIDU stock is one of the market’s biggest losers, down over 75% from its all-time high last seen in 2021. At 11.1 times trailing P/E (or 8.5 times forward), Baidu shares may very well be the cheapest way to gain exposure to cutting-edge AI models.\n\nGiven the depressed multiple and its AI capabilities, which may very well be among the best in China, I’m staying bullish. However, I acknowledge that it could take a lot of time and pain before BIDU stock proves its worth in one’s portfolio.\n\nBaidu’s AI model Ernie may not be the best in the world of the most capable. But it doesn’t have to be the best for it to be a growth engine for Baidu. Why? The Chinese government wants citizens to use homegrown AI models that abide by its rules and regulations. Indeed, ChatGPT could blow Ernie out of the water, but it won’t be able to gain ground in the Chinese market.\n\nIn essence, Baidu’s Ernie could be the ChatGPT of China. As AI phones and PCs take off, Baidu could have the most to gain as the Chinese government shuts out global AI firms that will probably struggle to play by the rules in China. Even if it’s not Ernie alone that powers Chinese AI phones of the future, I don’t see much, if any, expectation baked into the stock at these depths.\n\nIts P/E multiple is a fraction of that of American AI firms, thanks in part to the weak state of the Chinese economy and other geopolitical unknowns that can make Chinese investments seem more like a speculative gamble.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for BIDU Stock?\n\nBIDU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average BIDU stock price target of $141.29 implies 63.6% upside potential.\n\nSee more BIDU analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe following tech firms seem primed to buy after the market’s latest dip. Whether we’re talking about Nvidia and the likely continuation of its AI chip dominance, Snowflake and its ever-improving slate of AI tech and tools, or Baidu and Ernie’s shot to be China’s preferred AI model, each name has lots to look forward to in the medium term.\n\nOf the three, analysts see Baidu as having the most room to run for the year ahead (63.6%). Given the geopolitical risks, though, I’d rather go with Snowflake, which also has a respectable implied upside of nearly 58% from current levels. It’s been nothing but negative when it comes to SNOW stock of late. Perhaps a surprisingly decent quarter could spark a double-digit bounce.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "After hitting a high of $140 in June, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have pulled back amid a broader market sell-off, as well as reports that Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chip might get delayed.\n\nDespite all that, UBS is sticking with its $150 price target and \"buy\" rating on the stock. These price targets are usually just an estimate of where an analyst thinks a stock can trade in the near term. Based on the firm's research, investors might be underestimating Nvidia's earnings growth potential over the next few years.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nUBS believes that early shipments for Blackwell could be delayed to the end of January. However, it shouldn't hurt Nvidia's revenue in the near term, since it can sell more H200 graphics processing units (GPUs) to customers using them for artificial intelligence (AI) until Blackwell is available.\n\nThe firm sees strong commitments from AI researchers and growing demand from enterprises as a positive indicator for Nvidia's business. Indeed, the growing demand for training computers with AI is not slowing down. AI models are not as sophisticated as they will be in 10 years, and the growing demand for AI training in the data center is the biggest driver of Nvidia's revenue growth.\n\nStill, if Nvidia confirms a delay of Blackwell in its next earnings report on Aug. 28, it could limit the stock's gains and even cause a temporary sell-off, since it would introduce a new uncertainty to Nvidia's business outlook.\n\nUBS' price target implies 27% upside from the current $118 share price, which would stretch Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings multiple to an expensive 54. At these lofty share prices, Wall Street traders will be looking for any excuse to take a profit and sell no matter how great Nvidia's long-term growth prospects look right now.\n\nGiven the potential for negative news to impact Nvidia's share price in the near term, it doesn't hurt to wait to buy the stock until after the upcoming earnings report.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller’s investment firms trimmed their holdings in “Magnificent Seven” stocks before this year’s ebullient run-up in technology companies gave way to a major downturn in mid-July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nSoros Fund Management sold some of its stake in Alphabet Inc. totaling $58 million, and about $15 million of Amazon.com Inc., according to regulatory filings for the three months ended in June.\n\nDruckenmiller was among investors paring stakes in Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose soaring price accompanied investor fervor for artificial intelligence companies. His Duquesne Family Office sold more than 1.5 million shares, filings show.\n\nDavid Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, meanwhile, cut its holdings of Amazon, Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — three of its largest positions — continuing similar cuts reported at the end of March. David Bonderman’s Wildcat Capital Management also sold out of his Meta position, dumping shares worth $24 million in the quarter.\n\nThe filings point to how investors captured some of the benefits of the run-up before a benign economic outlook took a gloomier turn, with the Nasdaq 100 slumping 14% in the four-week period beginning July 10. The “Magnificent Seven” — which includes Alphabet, Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia — had been emblematic of the rally, reflected in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index, which rose 17% in both the first and second quarters.\n\nSpeaking in a CNBC interview in May, Druckenmiller — who earlier spent more than a decade as Soros’ chief strategist — suggested the artificial intelligence boom may be “over-hyped” in the short term.\n\nFunds with more than $100 million or more must file disclosures about their US holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The disclosures portray holdings of secretive money managers, including at hedge funds and large family offices that clear the threshold. Still, the picture is incomplete as documents omit most derivatives and short positions.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nIconiq Capital, the investment firm best known for managing money for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sold $2.5 million in Apple. Kemnay Advisory Services, a family office that helps manage the fortune of duty-free-shopping billionaire Alan Parker, cut its holdings of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. Soros sold out of its $108 million position in American National Insurance, and $67 million in Aramark. Druckenmiller’s Duquesne reported a new position in Mid-America Apartment Communities, a real estate investment trust that acquires multi-family apartments, worth $92 million and in cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. of $90 million. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. added stakes in cosmetics chain Ulta Beauty Inc. and aerospace company Heico Corp.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with Buffett’s purchases in last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Nvidia, Meta Platforms and AppLovin",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 15, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and AppLovin APP.\n\nMarket Rebound: 3 Stocks for the Next Leg Higher\n\nLast week the market experienced one of the fastest rises in volatility since the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis. The VIX index rose above 60 on Monday morning, which was a 40-point jump from the day before. However, what followed was equally impressive as volatility fell nearly just as fast as it rose, and today the VIX is below 17.\n\nWe know now that the unwind of the Yen carry trade led to a capitulation of the most levered traders and it seems that the worst is already behind us. And it makes sense that we can look forward confidently and use this as an opportunity to pick up shares in the best stocks.\n\nWe have a nice list of bullish factors holding up this market; the economy remains robust while inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve will begin lowering rates soon leading to an expansionary policy and earnings at the best companies in the world continue to grow nicely.\n\nSometimes you must see through the scary headlines and look at the most important variables that drive markets such as Fed liquidity and earnings growth. When investors do it like that, they can see these sharp corrections for what they really are, opportunities.\n\nSome of the best stocks in the world went on sale this last week and here I am going to identify three of my favorites. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and AppLovin have been some of the best performing stocks in the last year and based on their Zacks Ranks, growth forecasts and valuations remain unambiguously attractive.\n\nAppLovin Stock Boasts a Top Zacks Rank\n\nLesser known than the other two, AppLovin is a mobile technology company that specializes in mobile app growth, monetization, and user acquisition through its suite of software and services. AppLovin provides a powerful platform that enables app developers to enhance their marketing strategies, optimize user engagement, and maximize revenue. The company operates one of the largest mobile ad networks in the world and has also expanded into app development, acquiring and partnering with various gaming studios.\n\nAppLovin really has it all, as the stock enjoys powerful momentum pushing it higher, strong growth forecasts and a very reasonable valuation. Additionally, AppLovin has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, boosting the odds of a near-term rally. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates by a significant margin in just the last week. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to grow 20% annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the incredible appreciation the stock has experienced over the last two years it still trades near its lowest relative valuation. Because sales and earnings are growing so fast, the stock has actually gotten cheaper over the last year. Today, APP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.9x, which is right in line with the broad market and well below its three-year median of 64.5x.\n\nMeta Shares Approach All-Time Highs\n\nMeta Platforms is another stock that has put up truly stellar earnings results and price appreciation since the 2022 lows. In the chart below we can see that the price of META is bumping up against its recent all-time highs, and if it clears that level could begin another major bull leg.\n\nAlso visible in the chart is just how well Meta Platforms stock held up during the recent market correction and how quickly it has snapped higher.\n\nAlso worth noting is that Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and improving the near-term outlook of the stock. In the last month FY24 earning estimates have increased by 3.7% and FY25 by 2.6%. Current year sales are expected to grow 19.6% and next year's sales are expected to climb 14%. Furthermore, analysts project EPS to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.9x, which is just above the market average and just below its 10-year median of 25.1x. META also now pays a tidy 0.38% dividend to shareholders.\n\nNvidia Continues to Show Impressive Growth\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, Nvidia is not at the top of the Zacks rank, however it still boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Nvidia has of course been hugely influential to the broader market and the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. The company's vision into what AI could be, and its ability to position itself as the key piece of infrastructure for the technology had set it on a path to more than triple its sales and nearly 7x its EPS in the last two years.\n\nOver the last month the stock experienced its sharpest correction since the big bull run began, but like the others, investors have been snapping up shares during the sell off. Also like the others, Nvidia still enjoys a reasonable valuation, attracting new investors.\n\nWe can also see that the price action in NVDA is looking quite bullish as well, as on Monday, the stock broke out from a descending channel.\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 45.8x. This is above the broad market average and just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Although that may appear elevated to some investors,analysts forecast NVDA EPS to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, simply indicating a valuation priced for tremendous growth in profits.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs markets show signs of rebounding, the potential for the next leg higher is enticing. Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and AppLovin have all demonstrated strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and reasonable valuations that make them attractive picks. However, it's essential to remember that the market is unpredictable and can turn volatile without warning.\n\nWhile the current outlook might be optimistic, investors should always prioritize risk management. Maintaining a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and not overcommitting to any single position can help mitigate potential downsides. The market will ultimately do what it wants, and staying vigilant while focusing on long-term goals is key to navigating these opportunities wisely.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\n\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\n\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\n\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\n\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\n\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\n\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\n\nYTD Return as of August 1: 168%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. In addition to manufacturing world-class GPUs for AI, some of the other AI products of the firm include generative AI, cybersecurity AI, data analytics, conversational AI, and vision AI. The company also markets full stack innovation to turn any organization into an AI enterprise. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, the firm beat revenue estimates by a whopping $1.5 billion. The revenue grew by 262% year-on-year, and the non-GAAP earnings per share jumped from $0.88 to $5.16. The firm was able to deliver these numbers as it dominates the GPU market with 88% market share in the category.\n\nJensen Huang, the COO of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), said during the first quarter earnings call that the industry was going through a major transformation as companies shifted from an existing trillion-dollar traditional data center base to AI data centers. Huang detailed that beyond cloud service providers, generative AI had expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Should You Think About Buying NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Now?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a significant share price rise of 33% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NVIDIA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nWhat Is NVIDIA Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 33%, trading at US$118 compared to our intrinsic value of $88.99. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat does the future of NVIDIA look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you'd like to know more about NVIDIA as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NVIDIA you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in NVIDIA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "2 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Aug. 28",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the single biggest leap in technology since the internet -- or so say its biggest believers. Its effect on the market has been enormous. Led by the poster child of the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AI stocks went on a tear over the last few years that made a lot of people a lot of money.\n\nThe last month or so hasn't been so kind; the Nasdaq Composite is down more than 10% since its peak in early July. The majority of big tech players released their earnings for Q2 2024, and although there was a lot of positive news -- Meta Platforms posted 22% year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter -- investors were somewhat spooked by the larger-than-expected spends the companies are planning to make on AI infrastructure.\n\nThis, in combination with broader market fears -- here's hoping the Federal Reserve can nail that \"soft landing\" -- hit Nvidia hard. Its stock is down over 22% since July 10. But you know what? I think this is great news. It's a buying opportunity for those who still believe in the stock, and I do. With the company set to release its Q2 numbers on Aug. 28, here are two reasons to buy before it does.\n\n1. Big tech doesn't plan to slow its spending soon\n\nDuring the latest round of earnings calls, CEOs from the big tech players fueling Nvidia's monster returns fielded questions about their companies' expectations for future capital expenditures (capex), specifically those relating to AI. Alphabet, for instance, spent about $32.3 billion in capex in 2023. This year, the company could hit $50 billion. That's a massive increase, and it's not alone. Check out this chart showing the net change in capital expenditures from Alphabet et al. over the past year. META Capital Expenditures (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIf there is an end to massive spending on AI infrastructure, it is some ways off. AI is too big an opportunity, and no company wants to be left behind. As Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai put it in the earnings call, \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Although there is more to AI infrastructure than the chips Nvidia provides, they are arguably the most essential part, and Nvidia is likely to be flooded with cash for some time. Of course, Nvidia must work to maintain its market share, but it is in a strong position to do so.\n\n2. There are signs that AI is delivering real-world value\n\nBut can AI deliver the kind of real-world value that justifies its enormous cost? I think the jury is still out, but Meta's recent earnings make me more confident. As I mentioned earlier, Meta posted 22% revenue growth from a year ago and a whopping 73% jump in earnings per share. During its recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed this jump in part to AI. The company used AI to improve its content algorithm, which led to more engagement. This translated into more use, which meant more advertising revenue.\n\nZuckerberg spoke of his plans to have AI craft entire marketing campaigns -- both strategy and the creative assets themselves -- for advertisers. This could open up a whole new revenue stream for the company. The idea is just one example of the powerful, revenue-generating promise of AI. The more evidence of real-world value, the more companies will be willing to continue to spend on AI, and that is good news for Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Boring Stocks Will Outperform Nvidia Through 2025",
        "content": "I'm about to suggest two real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that I think will beat the returns of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) over the next year and a half. These are not just any REITs; they have relatively \"boring\" business models even by real estate standards.\n\nHear me out. I completely understand that Nvidia stock has nearly tripled over the past year alone and is up by a staggering 2,960% over the past five years. And the gains have been well-deserved. Nvidia has been at the center of the AI revolution, and its sales show why it has done so well for investors.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is an expensive stock. It trades for about 35 times trailing-12-month sales and for 43 times forward earnings. Even given its growth momentum, this is a lofty valuation.\n\nPlus, over the next couple of years, I believe the momentum in the market will shift in favor of dividend-paying value stocks.\n\nA falling-rate environment could be a tremendous catalyst for income stocks\n\nWithout getting too deep into an economics lesson, falling interest rates are generally a positive catalyst for income-focused stocks, especially REITs. The short explanation is that when risk-free interest rates (like Treasuries and CDs) rise, it tends to put upward pressure on stock yields as well. Since price and yield have an inverse relationship, rising interest rates tend to push REIT prices downward. In a falling-rate environment, the opposite is true.\n\nIn addition, REITs tend to rely on borrowed money more than most other sectors, and falling rates mean lower borrowing costs.\n\nAfter cooler-than-expected inflation data and some disappointing employment reports, the median investor expectation is for a total of two full percentage points of Federal Reserve rate cuts between now and September 2025. And I think this could be a big catalyst for some beaten-down REITs.\n\nTwo stocks that could be big winners\n\nI own about 10 different REITs in my portfolio and think they all have the potential to outperform in a falling-rate environment. But two REITs in particular that could be major beneficiaries are Easterly Government Properties (NYSE: DEA) and Vici Properties(NYSE: VICI).\n\nWe'll start with Easterly Government Properties, and in full disclosure, I don't personally own shares of this one -- not yet anyway. If you aren't familiar, this is a REIT that owns a portfolio of properties, all occupied by a single tenant -- the United States government and its subsidiaries. The VA is the largest tenant, and the FBI also has a major presence in the portfolio.\n\nMost of Easterly's properties are essential components of the agencies that operate within them, and generate reliable, growing income year after year. Easterly currently has a dividend yield of just below 8%, and the stock itself has been beaten down by more than 40% since the rate-hike cycle started in early 2022. But this is an extremely rate-sensitive REIT. Not only does the stable nature of its rental income make the stock trade more like a bond, but Easterly is one of the more debt-reliant REITs on my radar, so falling rates could be a big upward catalyst.\n\nStory continues\n\nVici Properties' tenants are rather exciting businesses. This is a REIT that is the largest owner of gaming properties in the market. It owns several iconic Las Vegas Strip properties, as well as a portfolio of high-quality regional-gaming assets. But from the perspective of Vici's investors, the company leases its properties to gaming operators, typically with 40- to 50-year lease terms. Its income, for the most part, is highly predictable.\n\nLike Easterly, Vici has been especially rate-sensitive partially because of the stable nature of its income. But unlike Easterly, Vici has a ton of liquidity that it can use to expand its portfolio of experiential real estate assets over the next several years, and a lower-rate environment would certainly be more conducive to growth. Management has already established an impressive track record of value-adding growth, and there could be plenty more in the years to come.\n\nA bold prediction\n\nTo be perfectly clear, this is meant to be a bold prediction. I believe both stocks will deliver market-beating returns through at least the end of 2025, and that after an incredible run, Nvidia could cool off a bit. And my thesis is dependent on the Fed cutting rates rather quickly, so if this doesn't happen, I could certainly be wrong. But regardless of what happens in the near term, both Easterly Government Properties and Vici are solid, well-run businesses and could deliver strong income and total returns for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Easterly Government Properties right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Easterly Government Properties, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Easterly Government Properties wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The world is becoming increasingly digital, particularly as artificial intelligence becomes more prominent. At the heart of this transformation are semiconductors and the companies that make them. Chip stocks are an appealing opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the technology of tomorrow.\n\nGraphics processing units are the key ingredient for powering generative AI applications. As artificial intelligence evolves, the demand for high-performance computing power is also growing.\n\nSemiconductors are the engines driving this revolution, powering complex algorithms that can generate new content, design innovative products, and even predict market trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd this no flash in the pan. Chip stocks represent companies that are capitalizing on a fundamental shift that will define the next era of technological advancement.\n\nGranted, the tech industry and chip stocks took a downturn in the last couple of weeks as investor fears of a bubble resurfaced. But I don’t see it that way.\n\nIn fact, I see this as an opportunity to capitalize on market weakness and to buy the best chip stocks at a discounted rate.\n\nI’m using the Portfolio Grader to find the best chip stocks that are playing a key role in generative AI. By investing in these chip stocks, you too can ride the wave of innovation into the future.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Iphone 11 with the logo of Nvidia Corporation which is a company specialized in the development of graphic processing units. Nvidia stock, NVDA stock\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can’t talk about chip stocks without first addressing Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company has roughly a 90% market share in making GPUs that power generative AI applications.\n\nIts stock soared over the last two years, and at one point this year was responsible for roughly one-third the return of the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia stock is down 10% in the last month, but there’s a big date coming up – on Aug. 28, Nvidia will report earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nIf history is any indication, this is a date that will push NVDA stock higher once again.\n\nNvidia’s 2025 Q1 revenue was up 262% from a year ago. And while that’s an unsustainable growth rate over the long term, Nvidia is still projecting $28 billion in revenue for the quarter. And if can beat those figures, NVDA stock is going to skyrocket again.\n\nBut investors should also keep a close eye out for any guidance updates that Nvidia issues. This is a time to be optimistic about Nvidia, but that doesn’t mean being reckless.\n\nNVDA stock is up 134% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) products are used for data centers, networking, storage, software, wireless and industrial products. It has an earnings report coming up soon as well, as the company is expected to announce third-quarter results on Sept. 5.\n\nAnalysts are expecting Broadcom to report earnings of $1.21 per share. And as Broadcom has a track record of quarterly EPS beats, investors can justifiably anticipate a strong quarter.\n\nBroadcom has been on a winning streak following its acquisition of VMware, which gave Broadcom access to VMware’s hybrid cloud platform to provide corporate customers with the power of a cloud network with data centers on site.\n\nBroadcom also uses Nvidia GPUs to let its customers run AI models, which is critically important for many companies.\n\nBroadcom’s upcoming earnings release should be solid. But as I recently suggested, there’s no need to over-invest in Broadcom stock. Maintain a reasonable position size, just in case high hopes lead to a letdown from Broadcom.\n\nAVGO stock is up 40% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), also known as TSMC, is just as essential to generative AI as Nvidia. I don’t think you can understate the company’s contributions.\n\nWhile Nvidia and other semiconductor companies are responsible for creating and designing GPUs, they don’t actually make them. That’s the responsibility of fabricators like TSMC, which is the most prominent semiconductor fabricator in the world.\n\nTSMC has a 61% market share in the global semiconductor foundry market. Demand for its services is increasing as companies such as Nvidia design more powerful chips for TSM to produce.\n\nIt’s also a good bet for investors who are looking to hedge their bets amid increasing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nChip companies in China are designing less-powerful processors specifically so they can retain TSMC as a chip producer, according to published reports.\n\nTSMC is increasing its investment in Arizona, where it agreed in April to use $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding to build a third fabrication plant in the Phoenix area.\n\nFor July, TSMC reported 45% year-over-year growth. That comes off a strong second quarter earnings report that included revenue of $20.82 billion, up 32.8% from last year.\n\nTSM stock is up 65% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes products for memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND and NOR technology. But its place on this list of chip stocks with a hand in AI is won for its partnership with Nvidia.\n\nMicron makes the world’s leading High-Bandwidth Memory 3E, or HMB3E, architecture.\n\nIt provides higher bandwidth than previous generations of memory, while being smaller and using less energy. Nvidia uses the HBM3E architecture in its latest graphics processing units, including the new H200.\n\nThe company also recently announced the development of PCIe Gen6 data center solid-state drive technology as part of its portfolio of memory and storage products to support increased demand for AI.\n\nSSD drives represent the new generation of storage devices in computers because they have transfer data faster than hard disk drives while also having shorter boot times and increased bandwidth.\n\nMicron created a chip that operates AI applications in Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) laptops. The chip will be used in Lenovo’s ThinkPad P1 Gen 7 laptops.\n\nThe company’s innovations are reflected in its earnings reports. Earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 showed revenue of $6.8 billion versus $3.75 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nMU stock is up 14% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nApplied Optoelectronics (AAOI) Stock Photo ID: 1659535744 Industrial technology concept. Container terminal. Logistics. Communication network. Secured logistics. GFAI stock.\n\nSource: metamorworks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow we are getting into some smaller companies on our list. But they still are strong AI plays, and it’s important for any portfolio to be diversified. After all, it doesn’t make sense to put all of your holdings into Nvidia or TSM.\n\nOne chip stock to consider closely is Applied Optoelectronics (NASDAQ:AAOI). The Texas-based company makes and supplies fiber-optic networking products, including diode lasers, photodiodes, subassemblies and more. Its customers are in China, Taiwan and the U.S., and its products are used in data centers and telecom products.\n\nRevenue in the second quarter was $43.2 million, up from $41.6 million a year ago. But notably, data center revenue was up to $34.3 million from $27.5 million.\n\nThat’s because the company put more resources into that growing field and less into telecom and CATV – both of which saw shrinking revenue for the quarter.\n\nI like AAOI as long as Applied Optoelectronics continues to focus on its data center growth. And the third quarter is expected to see even better results, as the company is guiding for revenue between $60 million and $66 million for Q3.\n\nAAOI is deeply discounted right now, off 58% for the year, but I’m projecting a much better second half. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAXT (AXTI) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder.

        "title": "7 Meme Stocks to Buy on the Dip: August 2024",
        "content": "Don’t expect “meme mania” to make a comeback soon, but there may be good reason to consider a few of the meme stocks to buy on the dip. Largely, stocks that have experienced meme-like rallies, but aren’t primarily in the meme stocks categories.\n\nShun names like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME). Instead, consider other hot stocks popular among retail investors.\n\nRather than depending on another “meme wave” to surge higher, these stocks have strong rebound potential. This time, because of company-specific catalysts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor instance, with some pre-revenue meme stocks, the announcement of major commercialization progress could send them “to the moon” once again.\n\nOr, for more established stocks with meme-like qualities, the reporting of better-than-expected fiscal results and guidance may be what gets them moving in the right direction once again.\n\nThere are also some meme stocks to buy on the dip that could be considered value plays, that have big upside potential if they experience a sentiment shift.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is an early-stage company in the electric vertical take-off and landing business, aka the “flying taxi” business. Although Archer has yet to generate material revenue, it has made significant progress so far this year in getting to the commercialization stage.\n\nAs I recently discussed, such progress has included further investment from strategic partners, among many other benchmark successes. Still, while ACHR stock surged on some of this news last month, shares have since pulled back sharply.\n\nShort interest has increased, as bearish investors bet that an economic slowdown stymies further progress for Archer. However, things continue to move in the right direction for the company.\n\nHitting even a small milestone can drive an outsized move higher for shares. With this in mind, you may want to consider buying ACHR on the dip.\n\nThis stock has been a popular meme play in the past, and could soon be popular among retail investors once again.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a beverage company. Best known for its eponymous energy drink, Celsius has experienced a high level of growth so far this decade. Generating just $75.1 million in sales during 2019, over the trailing twelve months, total revenue has come in at nearly $1.5 billion.\n\nYet after years of strong growth, as well as strong price performance for CELH stock, shares have entered a severe slump more recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter peaking at prices nearing $100 per share, CELH has since dipped down below $40 per share. However, with this sharp pullback, one can argue that the stock is now reasonably-priced, compared to future growth forecasts.\n\nAlthough there’s now increased skepticism that Celsius’ growth streak will continue, factors like the company’s aggressive expansion overseas suggest that high organic growth could persist.\n\nIf it does, it may lead to further strong growth of the company’s bottom line. Sell-side forecasts call for Celsius Holdings to report 23.1% earnings growth next year, and 44.2% earnings growth in 2026.\n\nA CELH comeback could pay off in a big way for those who get earl. Hence, consider it one of the meme stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) technology company. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be more of a “Mag 7” stock than a meme stock, but it’s popularity among retail traders makes it a name to consider for the purposes of this list.\n\nA big reason behind NVDA’s latest pullback has to do with increased concerns that the AI boom will soon slow down.\n\nBig Tech companies will walk back their AI infrastructure plans, resulting in less stellar growth levels for NVDA.\n\nThat said, while that may still be the overall sentiment today, this could change in a big way just a few weeks from now.\n\nAt the end of this month, Nvidia will report its latest fiscal results.\n\nAs Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Team recently argued, NVDA stock could experience a post-earnings surge.\n\nAt least, if the latest results and updates to guidance both exceed expectations, and calm down, AI slowdown fears.\n\nMuch like what happened with Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), another top AI stock, better-than-feared results and outlook could drive another wave of euphoria for NVDA among retail traders.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you thought I was stretching it including NVDA as one of the meme stocks to buy on the dip, you may find me including Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) on this list as a far reach.\n\nHowever, hear me out. Shares in the media conglomerate may not have been “meme kings” like AMC and GME once, but it’s possible many some traders piggybacked a short-lived momentum trade with this stock’s predecessor back in 2021.\n\nPARA stock could become popular with retail traders if it successfully transitions from television-focused to streaming-focused business models. With Paramount Global, a pending merger with Skydance could be key for executing this transformation.\n\nIf the Skydance merger, plus related turnaround plans, prove successful, the impact on PARA’s price performance could be tremendous. Shares today trade at a heavily-discounted 6.8 times forward earnings.\n\nEven a market rerating to say, 10-15 times earnings would mean a significant rebound in price. Meme investors approaching this opportunity may need to be a bit more patient, but the potential payoff could make it really worth it.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike NVDA, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) became popular among Main Street and Wall Street investors alike during the 2023 and 2024 waves of “AI stock mania.”\n\nTrading in the low-$80s per share at the start of the generative artificial intelligence growth boom, SMCI stock at one point surged by over fifteen-fold, to an all-time high of $1,229 per share.\n\nMore recently, though, waning enthusiasm for the AI growth trend has led to a significant drop in price for Super Micro Computer. The stock now changes hands for around $575 per share.\n\nYet while SMCI may look like a “falling knife” on a stock chart, pretty soon you may want to make it a meme stock to buy on the dip. Following its sharp price decline, the stock now trades for only 16.6 times earnings.\n\nAlthough much of this has to do with concerns about slowing growth and falling margins for the AI server maker. Still, with expectations now heavily walked-back, there may be a greater chance for Supermicro to positively surprise with subsequent results.\n\nThis could make it popular among both meme traders and the so-called “smart money” once again.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs you may recall, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) shares experienced numerous waves of “meme mania” during the height of the meme stock phenomenon in 2021.\n\nIn more recent years, however, shares in this fintech and neobank has both tumbled and struggled to make a recovery.\n\nBut while SOFI stock has been plodding along for several years, now may be the time to make it one of the meme stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nNow scaled to the point of profitability, SoFi could continue to report outsized increases in its bottom-line because of its high level of operating leverage.\n\nAnalyst consensus calls for SoFi’s earnings to rise fourfold next year, and by another 87.5% during 2026.\n\nThe company’s continued strong fiscal performance, including the recent reporting of “beat and raise” results late last month, strongly suggest that SoFi can meet these forecasts.\n\nPerhaps, even beat them. The high end of forecasts call for an even greater degree of earnings growth. Two years out, this stock could report earnings of between 50 and 75 cents per share. Not too bad, given how SOFI currently trades for around $6.75 per share.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this year, at the height of SoundHound AI’s (NASDAQ:SOUN) meme popularity, I was skeptical about the company’s AI growth bona fides.\n\nHowever, giving the situation a second look, I can now see a reasonable bull case for this AI audio company’s shares.\n\nThis changing view on SOUN stock all has to do with recent acquisition news. Last week, SoundHound AI announced plans to acquire enterprise AI software company Amelia.\n\nPut simply, there’s a lot to like about this transaction. As stated in the deal news release, this $80 million acquisition is poised to be accretive to earnings, with big potential for major revenue and cost synergies.\n\nSOUN has already bounced back slightly on the Amelia news, but further upside may lie ahead. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald have already raised their price target on the stock from $5 to $7 per share.\n\nHowever, the company’s shares previously traded at prices north of $10 per share during prior meme waves. Considering this, upside potential with this $5 meme stock on the dip may be far greater than you think.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI Bubble or Deep Value? 3 Semi Stocks to Watch After Last Week’s Plunge",
        "content": "Is there an artificial intelligence (AI) stock bubble that’s only starting to burst, or is the latest sell-off nothing more than a healthy, much-needed correction? That’s the big question on investors’ minds as they contemplate buying the dip in previously heated growth plays that are starting to show signs of bottoming out.\n\nOf course, only time will tell if the weakness in the names that began back in July is the start of something far worse. Given the real productivity gains to be had from AI, though, I’m inclined to believe the latest dip in semiconductor and AI names is just a correction, albeit a wildly painful one.\n\nEither way, overpaying for growth stories or momentum can always entail short-term pain. Let’s examine three semiconductor stocks that are worth watching as they turn a corner after one of the nastiest month-long spills of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have been nosediving alongside the semi group in recent months, shedding close to 43% of their value in around a month. That’s an excruciatingly painful crash that weighed heavily on chasers of the semi design firm.\n\nDespite the implosion, ARM stock is still up around 80% year-to-date (YTD). So, while the crash was sudden and vicious, it wasn’t quite as sizable as the parabolic rally that preceded it. As Arm Holdings outmuscles x86 architecture in modern PCs, it moves forward with launch plans of its very own chip next year. The latest ARM stock crash has created a great entry point for investors seeking more of a front-row seat to the AI boom.\n\nSure, the latest quarterly royalty revenues came up short, thanks to softness in IoT. However, the long-term narrative remains impressive, especially if you believe Arm Holdings is the way of the future.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has been quick to recover, with shares now up close to 15% from August lows. Undoubtedly, the $727 billion semi giant is starring at a massive $150 billion AI chip opportunity, at least according to the bulls over at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).\n\nAccording to the big bank, the fast-recovering semi firm seems to be experiencing “accelerating AI fundamentals” along with strength in its “non-AI semiconductor business” lately.\n\nThough it seems unlikely that growth will accelerate in an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fashion, it’s hard not to be excited about the firm as it expands its reach in one of the most explosive markets out there. Time will tell if the chip giant has reached some sort of growth inflection point. Either way, 24.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) seems way too cheap, given how the firm has positioned itself on AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares are still down 25% from recent highs after tumbling alongside most other AI and semi stocks in recent months. Though the company’s impressive new slate of Arm-powered PC chips has the potential to power growth as more people upgrade to the AI PC age, the company could lose major business from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) if the San Diego-based tech titan is successful with its own modem project.\n\nUndoubtedly, Apple experienced great difficulty in swapping out Qualcomm modems for its own. The iPhone maker still hasn’t given up, though. Recently, Wolfe Research stated that an Apple modem “is indeed coming.” It’s uncertain how much progress Apple has made since it extended a new modem deal through 2026. But, there’s a big risk that another extension will be off the table come 2027.\n\nEven if the Apple modem is ready to go in 2027 or 2028, Qualcomm has plenty of time to diversify its business to offset the impact of lost sales. Therefore, the 21.6 times trailing P/E multiple seems like a bargain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple.

        "title": "Prediction: These 4 Future Technologies Will Be Millionaire-Makers -- and Here Are the Top Stocks to Buy Now to Profit From Them",
        "content": "If hockey great Wayne Gretzky received a quarter every time his most famous quote was cited, he'd probably have more money than he made during his sports career. That quote, of course, is: \"I skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\"\n\nAlthough Gretzky's statement has become a cliché, it remains great advice for investors. Looking ahead is much preferable to looking to the past.\n\nIt could be easier to \"skate to where the puck is going\" with investing than many might think. I predict that these four future technologies will be millionaire-makers -- and here are the top stocks to buy now to profit from them.\n\n1. Artificial general intelligence (AGI)\n\nTremendous progress has been made in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. But what's potentially coming could make today's chatbots look primitive. Some experts predict artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be achieved before the end of this decade. Others think it will take several more decades.\n\nThere are different definitions of AGI. However, most focus on AI that has human-level intelligence with the ability to learn on its own. AGI holds the potential to transform businesses in every sector and industry.\n\nSeveral technology giants are already racing to develop AGI. It's impossible to know which one will be the first to achieve success or which will be the biggest winner. However, I think one company will profit tremendously from AGI in nearly any scenario: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for powering AI apps today. The company's heavy investments in research and development should keep it on top. AGI will likely require more powerful processing than current AI models. Nvidia's revenue and profits should skyrocket whenever the technology becomes available.\n\n2. Islet cell therapy\n\nIslet cell therapy involves transplanting islet cells from a pancreas into a patient's liver. These transplanted islet cells produce insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. The therapy holds the potential to cure type 1 diabetes (T1D).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) is the leader in developing a cure for T1D using islet cell therapy: The big biopharmaceutical company's pipeline features two T1D programs in phase 1/2 clinical studies: VX-880 and VX-264.\n\nVertex's early testing has already demonstrated tremendous potential for VX-880 in curing T1D. VX-264 is even more promising because it doesn't require the use of immunosuppressants as VX-880 does.\n\nStory continues\n\nAround 3.8 million patients in North America and Europe have T1D. A cure would almost certainly generate billions of dollars in sales. In the meantime, Vertex has huge growth opportunities with its cystic fibrosis franchise, gene-editing therapy Casgevy, and non-opioid pain drug suzetrigine, which could win U.S. approval by Jan. 30, 2025.\n\n3. Quantum computing\n\nQuantum mechanics can make your head spin. Tiny particles can exist in multiple states at the same time and be connected (or entangled) with other particles even if they're far apart. But it's also at the heart of quantum computing, a new type of computing that's significantly more powerful than current computers.\n\nMany companies are scrambling to develop quantum computers. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is arguably in the best position as of now. Google has set six key milestones in its quantum computing roadmap. It's already achieved two of them.\n\nGoogle believes it could develop a \"useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" by the end of this decade. The opportunities for quantum computing are enormous, including transforming drug development, designing new materials, modeling climate systems, and powering AI models.\n\n4. 6G wireless networks\n\n5G wireless networks have increased bandwidth significantly compared to previous wireless technologies. However, the future will be focused on 6G. This next generation of wireless technology will support data exchanges of up to 1 terabit per second (100 times faster than 5G networks).\n\n6G should open up multiple new opportunities. Holographic communications could be possible. Augmented reality and virtual reality could become more realistic. As you might expect, many companies should benefit from 6G. I think Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will be among the biggest winners.\n\nThe introduction of 6G technology would almost certainly kick off a massive iPhone upgrade supercycle. This would further boost Apple's revenue and profits through increased adoption of the company's services.\n\nWhen will 6G be available? A broad commercial rollout is expected by 2030. While that's still several years away, Apple's launch of Apple Intelligence, which bundles new generative AI features, could fuel growth in the meantime.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Though it took time for this innovative technology to go mainstream and mature, the internet, ultimately, altered the growth trajectory for Corporate America in a positive way.\n\nFor three decades, Wall Street and investors have been eagerly awaiting the next leap forward in technology that would do for businesses what the internet did in the mid-1990s. After a long wait, artificial intelligence (AI) looks to be the answer. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe massive addressable market for AI stems from the ability of software and systems to learn without human intervention. This machine learning capacity can help AI systems become more efficient at their tasks, or potentially learn entirely new skills, over time.\n\nThe game-changing potential of AI isn't lost on Wall Street institutions, analysts, or money managers. Most pundits expect this revolutionary technology will make investors richer -- but some price targets are more outsized than others.\n\nBased on the prognostications of three Wall Street pundits, the following trio of widely owned AI stocks offer as much as 1,200% upside!\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 91%\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that at least one Wall Street expert believes will soar is data-center hardware leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nDespite Nvidia gaining more than $2.2 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities believes it could effectively become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company. His Street-high $200 price target, which was issued following Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 forward split, suggests that 91% upside exists, based on the $104.75 share price the company ended at on Aug. 9.\n\nLike most Nvidia optimists, Mosesmann believes it'll maintain its dominance of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers. With demand for the company's chips handily outpacing supply, it's had little trouble increasing the selling price for its GPUs and boosting its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut Mosesmann is equally excited about Nvidia's CUDA platform. This is the toolkit developers use to build large language models. In Mosesmann's view, Nvidia's software will work hand-in-hand with its AI-GPUs to keep clients within its ecosystem.\n\nHowever, history is very much working against Mosesmann's prediction. We haven't seen a next-big-thing innovation in 30 years avoid an early stage bubble. With most businesses lacking a clear game plan for AI, it's pretty evident this technology is still early in its maturation process. In short, there's a high probability of a bubble-bursting event sooner than later with artificial intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's historic run-up also requires flawless execution, which simply isn't sustainable. Less than two weeks ago, it was reported that delivery of the company's next-generation GPU platform, known as Blackwell, would be delayed by at least three months due to design flaws. Even with this chip being sold out well into 2025, a delay opens the door for external and internal competitors to secure valuable data center \"real estate.\"\n\nMore than likely, we've already witnessed Nvidia's stock peak. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 195%\n\nA second leading AI stock that can skyrocket, according to the forecast of one Wall Street analyst, is customizable rack server and storage specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nLess than a month after Super Micro was added to the benchmark S&P 500, Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah issued a sky-high $1,500 price target on the company. With shares of Super Micro having retraced to \"just\" $508 and change, as of the closing bell on Aug. 9, Baruah's price target implies a near-tripling may await.\n\nBaruah believes the company is perfectly positioned within the AI space to capitalize on growing enterprise demand for high-compute data centers capable of running generative AI solutions and training large language models.\n\nAdditionally, its addition to the S&P 500 should allow for multiple expansion that, ultimately, drives its share price to $1,500 -- or $150 on a split-adjusted basis. On Aug. 6, Super Micro became the latest high-profile company to announce a stock split.\n\nWhile there's no denying that triple-digit year-over-year sales growth for a long-established infrastructure company is impressive, there are also reasons for investors to be cautious. For instance, Super Micro Computer incorporates Nvidia's ultra-popular H100 GPUs into its rack servers. The problem for Super Micro is that Nvidia can't meet all of its demand. This means it's at the mercy of its suppliers.\n\nThere's a bit of a precedent for expectations getting ahead of reality for Super Micro Computer, as well. The company's stock rocketed higher in the mid-2010s on the expectation that it would be a key infrastructure player in the enterprise cloud boom. Unfortunately, the lofty expectations of Wall Street and investors weren't met.\n\nAlthough Super Micro Computer may continue to surprise in the short run, I find it highly unlikely that Baruah's high-water target of $1,500 comes to fruition.\n\nTesla: Implied upside of 1,200%\n\nHowever, the crème-de-la-crème of upside price targets for AI stocks comes courtesy of Ark Invest CEO and Chief Investment Officer Cathie Wood.\n\nIn June, Ark's Monte Carlo analysis anointed a (drum roll) $2,600 price target on electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) by 2029. This implies a market cap of roughly $8.3 trillion, which is more than double the value of world's largest publicly traded company at the moment.\n\nWood and her team arrived at this lofty price target by placing immense emphasis on Tesla's AI-powered robotaxi business. Five years from now, Wood expects Tesla to generate $1.2 trillion in annual sales, with 63% of revenue, and 86% of the $440 billion in forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), coming from robotaxis.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, a glaring flaw with Ark Invest's Monte Carlo model. Namely, Tesla doesn't have a single robotaxi on public roads, despite claims from CEO Elon Musk in April 2019 that his company would have \"over a million robotaxis on the road\" the following year. Tesla has been unable to move past Level 2 autonomy, which is going to make it virtually impossible for the company to achieve even a fraction of what Wood's Monte Carlo analysis has predicted.\n\nPerhaps the bigger issue here is that Tesla's valuation has been inflated by promises made by Musk that haven't been kept. In addition to failing to deliver on \"over a million robotaxis,\" Musk has suggested that Tesla's EV are \"one year away\" from full autonomy every year for a decade. If this laundry list of unfulfilled promises and hype (e.g., Optimus) are backed out of Tesla's valuation, shares could easily lose three-quarters of their value, if not more.\n\nTo make matters worse, competition has picked up in a meaningful way for the company's EV business -- i.e., the operating segment that's historically generated most of its cash flow and operating income. The price war Tesla kicked off in 2023 to spur demand for its EVs cratered its operating margin and has been unable to halt the rise of global EV inventory.\n\nLast but not least, Tesla's pre-tax income has become increasingly reliant on unsustainable sources. Nearly 66% of the company's pre-tax income in the June-ended quarter was derived from regulatory tax credits sold to other automakers and interest income on its cash.\n\nSuffice it to say, nothing justifies Tesla's current $200 price tag, let alone Wood's $2,600 moonshot call.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated and reshuffled a lot since the start of last year. A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) has shed light on the vast potential of tech stocks, rallying investors and boosting the Nasdaq Composite by more than 60% since Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) secured its position as the world's most valuable company by market cap in 2011 and held that spot consistently until this year. The tech giant temporarily lost the top position between January and June of 2024 when Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) surpassed Apple, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly achieved a market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nHowever, Apple's market cap of $3.3 trillion has seen it once again become the world's most valuable company. Yet, Microsoft and Nvidia continue to nip at its heels and could overtake the company for good in the coming years.\n\nMicrosoft's diversified business model and increasingly established position in AI indicate it could have a more reliable position in tech. Meanwhile, Nvidia's nearly unrivaled dominance in the chip market appears to be the gift that keeps on giving as demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to soar.\n\nSo, here are two stocks that I predict will be worth more than Apple five years from now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's market cap was $360 billion at the start of 2023 and is now $2.6 trillion, delivering an impressive growth spurt.\n\nThe company has consistently outperformed Apple in stock growth over the last five years, with its share price up 2,600% compared to the iPhone maker's 330% rise. And that trend is unlikely to slow anytime soon. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis chart shows the massive difference in financial growth Nvidia and Apple have experienced over just the last year. While these companies are both leaders in tech, their businesses differ significantly.\n\nNvidia is profiting from soaring demand for chips, specifically its GPUs. These chips power many products, from cloud platforms to AI models, personal computers, game development engines, and more. Meanwhile, Nvidia has achieved an estimated 70% to 95% market share in GPUs.\n\nTechnological advances are only likely to continue increasing the demand for powerful chips as companies work to improve their hardware and software offerings. Conversely, Apple has struggled to attract new customers to its products over the last year, with its iPhone and Mac revenue down 10% and 8%, respectively.\n\nApple is working to expand in AI and will launch a major software update this fall called Apple Intelligence. The update will overhaul its operating systems, introducing various generative features. The company hopes Apple Intelligence will convince millions of consumers to upgrade their devices, as the features will only be accessible with newer products. While the software could boost earnings for the current fiscal year, how Apple will profit from AI over the long term remains to be seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia maintains a crucial role in the industry as a leading chipmaker, a position that will likely see it surpass Apple by market cap over the next five years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nFor years, Microsoft has played second fiddle to Apple on the list of most valuable companies. Apple has consistently outperformed the Windows company in stock growth, rising 330% since 2019 compared to Microsoft's 195%.\n\nHowever, that trend has shifted in 2024. Microsoft's share price is up 12% year to date, with Apple's up 8%. It's not a huge difference, but Microsoft's head start in AI and potent position in software will likely see it continue to outperform its rival.\n\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion in spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft's diverse business model grants it multiple ways to monetize its AI products, thanks to homegrown brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Bing, Xbox, and LinkedIn.\n\nSince the start of 2023, the company has introduced generative features across its product lineup. This includes new productivity tools on Windows and its Office productivity suite, a revamp of Bing, and multiple AI solutions on its cloud platform Azure. Microsoft has also begun recouping some of its hefty investment in AI, attracting new members to Azure and Microsoft 365. Their respective segments have enjoyed year-over-year sales rises of 12% and 20% in 2024. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft is outperforming Apple in earnings growth. Over the last three years, Microsoft's quarterly revenue and operating income have risen far higher than Apple's.\n\nMicrosoft became a behemoth in tech thanks to its success in software. The emergence of AI has given it the opportunity for its unique skill set and product range to shine. The company arguably has more growth potential in AI, which could allow it to overtake Apple in market value before the end of the decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire investor David Tepper held about steady in the Chinese companies that he scooped up earlier this year, even as he trimmed his stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and US tech giants.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nWhile Tepper’s Appaloosa Management cut its stake in Alibaba by about 7% in the second quarter, the Chinese e-commerce giant remains the fund’s biggest position, accounting for 12% of its $6.2 billion equity portfolio, according to a 13F regulatory filing Wednesday.\n\nTepper also tweaked his investment in other Chinese companies, adding stakes in JD.com Inc., KE Holdings Inc. and two Chinese exchange-traded funds, while reducing positions in PDD Holdings and Baidu Inc. All told, the Chinese shares and ETFs made up 26% of the fund’s equity portfolio.\n\nTepper — who founded Appaloosa in 1993 — continued to slash his exposure to US tech companies, including Amazon.com, Microsoft Corp., and Meta Platforms Inc. His holdings in Nvidia Corp. fell by 84% during the quarter to $85 million, or 1.4% of the portfolio.\n\nTepper, along with Scion Asset Management’s Michael Burry, has become one of the few prominent China stock bulls among hedge fund investors. He loaded up on Chinese stocks in the first quarter – more than doubling his stake in Alibaba — as an equity rout prompted state-backed funds to step up purchases to prop up the market.\n\nRead: Michael Burry Raises Alibaba Stake, Cuts Stock Portfolio in Half\n\nSince then, Chinese stocks have been struggling to gain momentum as the years-long housing slump sapped consumer confidence. The MSIC China Index gained just 0.4% this year as one of the biggest laggards in the global market, trailing the S&P 500’s 14% return.\n\nLike Tepper, Burry — who rose to fame for his bet against the US housing market in 2008 — stuck to his bullish bets on China, even as he slashed his overall equity portfolio in half in the second quarter. Burry boosted his stake in Alibaba and Baidu last quarter, while paring back on JD.com. The three Chinese companies made up 46% of his $52 million equity portfolio.\n\nAlibaba and JD.com will report latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. Alibaba has returned 4.8% this year, including dividend, while JD.com lost 7.7%.\n\n--With assistance from Yiqin Shen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

While the chips that these companies make are indispensable for running AI workloads, they have to be housed somewhere, and this is where data centers come into play.\n\nIn fact, for the data center space, AI has only accelerated the growing demand this industry is seeing. Prior to AI GPUs and accelerators, enterprise computing chips made by the same companies that are now making AI chips were seeing hefty demand. This demand led to gaming GPU companies effectively being transformed into enterprise computing firms, with sectors such as the SaaS and cloud computing industries relying on these products. For some SaaS stocks, you should check out 10 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThis pre AI demand for data centers is visible in statistics too. Data from Jefferies shows that the demand growth for data centers has jumped by between 10% to 20% for the last 15 years, or before AI GPUs hit the market. As expected, AI has accelerated this demand, with the demand for data center space outpacing 30% in most markets for the past two years. This growth in real estate requirements also means that while the computing industry might be able to scale up by providing products like networking gear and cables, tertiary industries like energy generation will take some time to catch up.\n\nIf you're a believer in AI, then the optimistic line of thought would suggest that these tertiary firms will only grow in the future as they scale up their operations to meet the growth in AI data centers. After all, data from Goldman shows that a query made to ChatGPT consumes ten times as much energy as a Google search query - understandable since ChatGPT is parsing through data and drawing insights to generate a response. By 2030, AI is expected to grow data center power demand by as much as 160%, as data centers potentially account for 4% of global energy consumption and Europe in particular needs more than $1 trillion to power its AI grid.\n\nNaturally, since the US is responsible for ushering in AI, AI energy consumption in America is higher than that in other countries. According to the Boston Consulting Group, by 2030, AI power consumption will account for 16% of all of America's energy use. It is expected to grow by 15% to 20% annually and touch as much as 130 GW, or the amount of electricity that's used by 100 million homes. AI chip companies are also aware of these trends, with the latest AI chips promising to improve energy efficiency by 25x. Improving AI performance at the semiconductor level is important especially since some areas where data centers are growing are being forced to turn to coal power to reduce the power gap.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than in Northern Virginia, where data centers process 70% of the world's internet traffic. With more than 300 data centers that churn out more than $700 million in taxes annually, the region's computing centers are expected to require a whopping 11,000 megawatts of electricity annually by 2035 according to estimates by the local regulator. This demand has also spurred a $5.2 billion effort to lay down new transmission lines and keep coal power plants open for longer than initially planned.\n\nNot only does AI need real estate and power, but it also needs water. Since energy can neither be created nor destroyed, all the megawatts of power that AI chips need have to go somewhere. For the chips, it is dissipated in the form of heat, and cooling this requires copious amounts of water. Estimates show that not only does training GPT-3 evaporate a whopping 700,000 liters of drinkable water, but global AI demand by 2027 could end up using anywhere between 4.2 billion to 6.6 billion cubic meters of water.\n\nComing back to real estate, it might be the easiest way for the AI savvy investor to cash in on the world's thirst for computing. Citi believes that the \"development and construction of hyper-scale data center capacity will grow meaningfully over the next 7 years,\" as global industrial giants expand into the data center space. Not only are industrial firms actually converting their warehouses into data centers, but Citi adds that the associated power demand for these computing facilities will grow between the mid teens annually until 2030.\n\nSo, as these Wall Street firms lay out a maze of industries that will profit from AI, we decided to look at the top data center stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top data center stocks to buy, we ranked the US listed holdings of Global X's data center ETF and the stocks chosen by Jefferies and Citi by the average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked out the stocks with the highest upside.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 25%\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target: $125.43\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q1 2024: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the hottest stock in the AI sector right now. However, the fact that its shares are up by 135% over the past twelve months means that further upside is limited. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the data center industry due to its plethora of GPUs and bundles. Not only does it sell standalone GPUs, but it also sells them in clusters that are tailor made for AI use. The GPUs' tight integration with their CUDA software means that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers enjoy a significant advantage when it comes to squeezing the most performance from the products. However, the very fact that it sits at the top of the AI supply chain leaves NVIDIA vulnerable to competitors and customers designing their own chips and regulators deciding that it has abused its competitive power. However, analysts are certain of robust demand for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s products until at least 2025 end.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"Nvidia contributed to portfolio performance in the second quarter as investors continued to view positively the new product roadmap for the rest of the year. The company sees accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises. Nvidia’s GPU semiconductors continue to be the industry-leading building blocks of the accelerated computing data center architecture to drive AI compute and applications.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 13th on our list of the best data center stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Dividend Investor Who Earns $4000 Per Month Shares His Top 7 Portfolio Holdings\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nLiving off dividends sounds fantastic, but it isn't easy. To earn significant dividends, you must put a hefty amount into stocks/ETFs with high yields and constantly watch out for risks and losses. The last thing you'd want in your dividend investing journey is losing money.\n\nThousands of successful investors share their experiences and advice on Reddit's daily dividend investing discussion boards. We came across an interesting discussion in which a Redditor shared that he makes about $4,000 a month in dividends. He provided a complete breakdown of his portfolio, historical returns, and principal investment.\n\nTrending: Don’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThe Redditor claims to make $4,000 monthly with an initial investment of $150,000. Most portfolios comprise risky covered call ETFs with extremely high yields and income funds. We picked some of the most important funds from the portfolio and explained their income generation strategy.\n\nYieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF\n\nYieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:AIYY) is a covered call ETF that provides investors with indirect exposure to C3.ai, Inc. How do such ETFs generate income? The ETF sells call options on the shares it owns (in this case, C3.ai) and generates premiums, which are distributed to investors.\n\nThe YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF\n\nThe YieldMax™ AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (AMDY) is another covered call ETF that generates monthly income at a distribution rate of about 38%. The last payment was about $0.4306 per share. The ETF provides indirect exposure to AMD shares.\n\nThe S&P 500 Enhanced Options Income ETF\n\nThe S&P 500 Enhanced Options Income ETF (JEPY) is one of the reliable high-yield income ETFs that generate a healthy distribution per month. It's another covered call ETF, but instead of focusing on a single company, JEPY provides exposure to the broader S&P 500 index. JEPY is suitable for investors looking for stable income with low volatility.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Enhanced Options Income ETF\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Enhanced Options Income ETF (QQQY) generates a sizable distribution, albeit with risks. The ETF sells in-the-money put options on the Nasdaq 100 daily, meaning the options' strike price is above the index’s current market price. This strategy sacrifices capital gains from the share price appreciation of the Nasdaq in return for a high options premium.\n\nQQQY is suitable for investors looking for higher income and willing to accept a cap on potential market gains. The ETF has a distribution rate of about 71%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast — No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.

Analysts believe NVDY is suitable for those who believe in the long-term potential of Nvidia but want to hedge against potential declines in the chipmaker's shares.\n\nThe Defiance S&P 500 Income Target ETF\n\nThe Defiance S&P 500 Income Target ETF (SPYT) invests in ETFs that track the S&P 500's performance and sells daily credit call spreads on the Index. This means the ETF sells a call option and buys another one at a higher price, earning income from the premium received. The ETF has a distribution rate of about 20% and pays monthly.\n\nRex Fang & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF\n\nRex Fang & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI) generates monthly income by writing call options on top Big Tech companies. The fund aims to use Big Tech \"volatility\" to generate income. The ETF owns 15 stocks, including Salesforce, Tesla, Adobe, Amazon and Nvidia. The ETF's distribution rate is about 25%.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "Is META Stock the Next Big Bet? Signs of a Comeback Spark Investor Interest.",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock saw a 14% increase last week, outpacing the 4% return for the S&P 500. This strong performance was driven by a positive market response to Meta’s earnings report, highlighting second-quarter results in its core advertising business.\n\nThe stock’s recent rally marks a significant turnaround from the previous quarter, when concerns over Meta’s AI investments led to a sharp decline in its share price. The high stock price growth reflects growing street optimism about Meta’s capacity to execute its AI initiatives while continuing to deliver strong results in its core business areas.\n\nMoreover, this recovery suggests that the market is beginning to accept the financial value of Meta’s investments in AI. These are starting to yield tangible benefits. Further, the market’s positive response to Meta’s Q2 earnings indicates that Meta may outperform its Magnificent 7 peers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and may continue its upward trajectory. This outperformance will likely attract prolonged street interest that may support the stock’s momentum, making Meta stock a strong buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvertising and User Engagement Strength\n\nMeta’s core advertising business remains a core driver of its performance. The business contributed $38.3 billion in revenue for the quarter, a 22% annual increase. Given the challenging macro conditions, this growth is decisive, indicating that Meta’s advertising platforms deliver value to advertisers. The company progressively leveraged its vast user base. The user base now includes 3.27 billion daily active users across its apps, which derives engagement and ad top-line growth.\n\nFurther, the strong performance of Meta’s advertising business is highly supported by the 10% increase in ad impressions. There was also a 10% rise in the average price per ad. These metrics highlight the sharpness of Meta’s ad targeting and delivery mechanisms. MEta saw growth in ad revenue across different geographic regions (particularly Asia Pacific and Europe). This underscores Meta’s platforms’ global reach and appeal to advertisers in diverse markets.\n\nThe company is focused on improving the quality of ad recommendations and enhancing user engagement through AI-driven advancements. This has been critical to maintaining Meta stock’s progressive market valuation in digital advertising.\n\nMassive User Base and Engagement\n\nMeta’s user base continues to grow, with the number of people using its Family of Apps on a daily basis averaging 3.27 billion in June, an increase of 7% year-over-year. This represents a significant increase in user engagement, driven by the company’s efforts to enhance the user experience across its platforms. The growth is robust in regions like Asia Pacific and Europe. Here, ad revenue increased by 33% and 26%, highlighting Meta’s global appeal.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the company has had a lot of success in attracting and retaining users. This is especially true among young adults, as observed in the growing popularity of platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. For instance, WhatsApp now boasts over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., While Threads is approaching 200 million monthly active users globally. These platforms are becoming increasingly important to Meta’s overall ecosystem. They contribute to higher user engagement and offer new monetization opportunities. Its focus on enhancing the user experience through AI-driven content recommendations has been instrumental in deriving Meta stock’s high price growth.\n\nAI Investments and Growth Potential\n\nThe company plans to spend $37 billion to $40 billion this year in capital expenditures, and its aggressive investments in AI are beginning to bear fruit. These significant advancements boosted AI-driven content recommendations and ad targeting. For instance, the company has rolled out a full-screen video player. Similarly, a unified video recommendation service across Facebook integrates Reels, longer videos, and live content into a single experience. This initiative already increased engagement on Facebook Reels. This indicates the potential for further growth as Meta continues to refine its AI models.\n\nFinally, Meta’s AI advancements extend beyond its core business. It also extends to new experiences and products like Meta AI and AI Studio. These platforms allow users and businesses to create personalized AI agents, offering new ways to engage with content and communities. The potential for widespread adoption of these AI-driven tools could significantly boost Meta’s revenue streams. This is particularly true in the business messaging and creator economy segments. Lastly, the company’s lead on open-source AI is reflected in the release of Llama 3.1, which positions Meta as a leader in the AI industry and justifies a buy rating for the stock.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in META. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in AAPL.\n\nYiannis Zourmpanos is the founder of Yiazou Capital Research, a stock-market research platform designed to elevate the due diligence process through in-depth business analysis.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), expressed his views on a range of topics in a discussion led by Professor Erik Brynjolfsson and students at Stanford University.\n\nAmong other things, Schmidt suggested that investors should \"know what to do in the stock market\" if bearing in mind that ~$300 billion in hardware capex will go to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOn why Google is lagging behind in the generative AI technology race, Schmidt pinpointed the company's emphasis on work-from-home arrangements and flexible hours as the key reason for its current position behind competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSchmidt, who led Google from 2001 to 2011 and served as executive chairman until 2015, highlighted a shift in the company's priorities, suggesting that Google has placed a greater value on work-life balance than on leading the competitive AI industry.\n\nHe contrasted this approach with that of startups, where a more intensive work ethic is common.\n\nWhen Brynjolfsson sought clarification on this issue from the current CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, he did not receive a definitive response.\n\nThis prompted Schmidt's explanation, where he criticized the remote work culture and praised the return to office work in 2022 for its professional benefits and its role in developing managerial skills among younger workers.\n\nHe argued that for new companies aiming to compete with established startups, a more traditional in-office work model is essential.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt suggests investors should buy Nvidia stock\n\nEarnings call: Hudbay Minerals reports steady progress and growth plans\n\nEarnings call: Lument Finance Trust posts a GAAP net income of $0.07 per share\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Market Rebound: 3 Stocks to Buy for the Next Leg Higher",
        "content": "Last week the market experienced one of the fastest rises in volatility since the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis. The VIX index rose above 60 on Monday morning, which was a 40-point jump from the day before. However, what followed was equally impressive as volatility fell nearly just as fast as it rose, and today the VIX is below 17.\n\nWe know now that the unwind of the Yen carry trade led to a capitulation of the most levered traders and it seems that the worst is already behind us. And it makes sense that we can look forward confidently and use this as an opportunity to pick up shares in the best stocks.\n\nWe have a nice list bullish factors holding up this market; the economy remains robust while inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve will begin lowering rates soon leading to an expansionary policy and earnings at the best companies in the world continue to grow nicely.\n\nSometimes you must see through the scary headlines and look at the most important variables that drive markets such as Fed liquidity and earnings growth. When investors do it like that, they can see these sharp corrections for what they really are, opportunities.\n\nSome of the best stocks in the world went on sale this last week and here I am going to identify three of my favorites. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and AppLovin (APP) have been some of the best performing stocks in the last year and based on their Zacks Ranks, growth forecasts and valuations remain unambiguously attractive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAppLovin Stock Boasts a Top Zacks Rank\n\nLesser known that the other two, AppLovin is a mobile technology company that specializes in mobile app growth, monetization, and user acquisition through its suite of software and services. AppLovin provides a powerful platform that enables app developers to enhance their marketing strategies, optimize user engagement, and maximize revenue. The company operates one of the largest mobile ad networks in the world and has also expanded into app development, acquiring and partnering with various gaming studios.\n\nAppLovin really has it all, as the stock enjoys powerful momentum pushing it higher, strong growth forecasts and a very reasonable valuation. Additionally, AppLovin has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, boosting the odds of a near-term rally. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates by a significant margin in just the last week. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to growth 20% annually. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the incredible appreciation the stock has experienced over the last two years it still trades near its lowest relative valuation. Because sales and earnings are growing so fast, the stock has actually gotten cheaper over the last year. Today, APP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.9x, which is right in line with the broad market and well below its three-year median of 64.5x. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Shares Approach All-Time Highs\n\nMeta Platforms is another stock that has put up truly stellar earnings results and price appreciation since the 2022 lows. In the chart below we can see that the price of META is bumping up against its recent all-time highs, and if it clears that level could begin another major bull leg.\n\nAlso visible in the chart is just how well Meta Platforms stock held up during the recent market correction and how quickly it has snapped higher. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAlso worth noting is that Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and improving the near-term outlook of the stock. In the last month FY24 earning estimates have increased by 3.7% and FY25 by 2.6%. Current year sales are expected to grow 19.6% and next year’s sales are expected to climb 14%. Furthermore, analysts project EPS to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nMeta Platforms is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.9x, which is just above the market average and just below its 10-year median of 25.1x. META also now pays a tidy 0.38% dividend to shareholders. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNvidia Continues to Show Impressive Growth\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, Nvidia is not at the top of the Zacks rank, however it still boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Nvidia has of course been hugely influential to the broader market and the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. The company’s vision into what AI could be, and its ability to position itself as the key piece of infrastructure for the technology had set it on a path to more than triple its sales and nearly 7x its EPS in the last two years.\n\nOver the last month the stock experienced its sharpest correction since the big bull run began, but like the others, investors have been snapping up shares during the sell off. Also like the others, Nvidia still enjoys a reasonable valuation, attracting new investors.\n\nWe can also see that the price action in NVDA is looking quite bullish as well, as on Monday, the stock broke out from a descending channel. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 45.8x. This is above the broad market average and just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Although that may appear elevated to some investors,analysts forecast NVDA EPS to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, simply indicating a valuation priced for tremendous growth in profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs markets show signs of rebounding, the potential for the next leg higher is enticing. Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and AppLovin have all demonstrated strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and reasonable valuations that make them attractive picks. However, it's essential to remember that the market is unpredictable and can turn volatile without warning.\n\nWhile the current outlook might be optimistic, investors should always prioritize risk management. Maintaining a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and not overcommitting to any single position can help mitigate potential downsides. The market will ultimately do what it wants, and staying vigilant while focusing on long-term goals is key to navigating these opportunities wisely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback",
        "content": "\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"was a suspenseful horror hit in the late '90s. Millennials may remember the movie and its sequel starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. The story follows four teenagers involved in a hit-and-run accident and a killer seeking revenge for an apparent murder the teens committed. A year after the accident, the teens begin receiving ominous messages from the mysterious killer.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with CMG.\n\nToday's stock market has a bit of that same feel. Recall it was last summer when the S&P 500 was in the throes of a correction. Equities peaked in late July during the heart of the second-quarter earnings season and would go on to bottom the following October. The pullback was nearly as textbook as it could get considering that U.S. large caps dipped 10% over the course of three months before resuming a broader uptrend.\n\nTroubling headlines in early August\n\nInvestors are now receiving ominous messages and reminders about volatility. Last week, the VIX Index soared above 65 for a moment following a turbulent weekend of bearish news that included confirmation of a large sell of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A),[1] reports of a delay in Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chips,[2] turmoil in the Japanese stock market and its yen carry trade unwind[3] and the potential for war in the Middle East.[4] All of that followed a disappointing U.S. jobs report after the Federal Reserve decided to put off its first rate cut, likely until September.[5]\n\nWhile the reasons may be much different from this time in 2023, investors likely feel as if the bears are stalking them for past misgivings as we venture further into a historically weak period on the calendar. And we see selling pressure among a handful of once-hot individual stocks that announced splits earlier this year.\n\nThe appeal of stock splits\n\nThe media often discuss stock splits in a positive light. After all, the reason a management team elects to divide its existing shares into multiple shares is commonly as a result of a previous run-up in the stock. A traditional split can increase trading liquidity, and it may have certain psychological benefits as investors may perceive a lower-priced stock as more accessible, even if the company's fundamental value hasn't changed. Stock splits can even be implemented to make shares more affordable for employees in certain stock-based compensation plans.\n\nMore splitters\n\nTraditional stock splits were back in vogue last quarter. Second-quarter 2024 featured 29 split announcements the highest in three years. It's not surprising considering that markets were in rally mode, led by strength in U.S. large caps. The third quarter is already tracking well with 10 split announcements as of Aug. 7.\n\nSecond quarter marked a three-year high in traditional stock-split announcements Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nDigging into the anomaly\n\nResearch shows that stocks that split tend to beat their primary index, but the alpha trend has waned over the years as the anomaly has become more widely understood. BofA Global Research reports that since 2010, stocks that have split have posted a 12-month forward return five percentage points above the index. While that's strong, it's far short of the 10-percentage-point-plus positive gap seen in previous decades.\n\nStocks that split have historically outperformed Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: BofA Global Research\n\nMore recent figures from Goldman Sachs, using FactSet data, reveal that in the past five years, the stock-split halo has been even less powerful. Average excess returns among splitters are essentially flat in the following week, month and three-month periods.\n\nThe stock split announcement effect has disappeared recently Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Goldman Sachs\n\nA changing market\n\nWhy aren't we seeing the outperformance of yesteryear? Well, information is more easily available today and the advent of fractional-share trading along with markets that are perhaps more efficient at least partially negates the halo effect of a stock split. There are also fewer splits as higher share prices are now accepted, and many large companies are not as concerned about needing to appeal to retail investors due to large institutional shareholder bases.\n\nStock-split stars hit the skids\n\nTurning to recent market action, let's follow four of this year's highest-profile stock splitters. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), NVDA, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) each announced splits, the first being Chipotle back on March 19. Nvidia followed with a 10:1 on May 22, then came MicroStrategy's 10:1 on July 11 and Super Micro joined the party on Aug. 8.\n\nThrough last Wednesday, all of those stocks were mired in steep drawdowns. Notice in the graph below that the best performer was Chipotle down 22% from its mid-June peak. Nvidia was the poster child for the artificial intelligence-fueled bull market from late 2022 through the first half of 2024, but the mega-cap is now well into bear-market territory. MicroStrategy, often included in the same conversation as crypto, tested its March peak last month, but has since plunged more than 30%. Super Micro, another AI play, reacted harshly after its quarterly earnings report and stock-split announcement on Aug. 6.\n\n2024 drawdowns: CMG, NVDA, MSTR, SMCI down sharply from year-to-date highs despite split announcements Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Koyfin Charts\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere's a feeling of deja vu in markets today. The S&P 500 fell about 10% from late July through early fourth quarter last year, and that followed downside price action over a similar stretch in 2022. This year, the bears have asserted themselves after the bulls controlled the first half. Shares of companies that recently announced stock splits are well off their highs, generally not benefiting from the historical trend of outperformance.\n\n1 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway Slashes Apple Stake, The Wall Street Journal, Karen Langley, August 3, 2024, https://www.wsj.com2 Nvidia Investors Grapple With Delay to Next Generation AI Chip, The Wall Street Journal, Tom Dotan, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com3 Why the Yen Carry Trade Unwind Has Further to Go, The Wall Street Journal, Chelsey Dulaney, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com4 Mideast Braces for More Violence Amid Warnings of Iranian Attack, The Wall Street Journal, Laurence Norman, Benjamin Katz, Feliz Soloman, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com5 Market Selloff Upends Fed Rate-Cut Calculus, The Wall Street Journal, Nick Timiraos, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital, an early backer of Nvidia Corp., is starting a fund focused on artificial intelligence to capitalize on “insatiable demand” he’s predicting for the next decade.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nThe Maverick Silicon fund, the first sector-specific vehicle in the firm’s 30-year history, will invest in mid- and late-stage private companies that focus on computing infrastructure to support the AI ecosystem, Ainslie wrote in a letter to investors.\n\nMaverick, which manages $7.4 billion, put its own cash in the new fund on July 1 and will allow clients to invest ahead of its second close, which is expected before year-end.\n\nA spokesperson for the Dallas-based firm declined to comment.\n\nAinslie, whose firm first invested in Nvidia two decades ago, reiterated his bullish views on AI and dismissed arguments that the recent swoon in tech stocks is a repeat of the 1999 dot-com bust. He wrote that he’s increasingly fielding questions about the parallels between that period and today’s markets, and advised younger traders not to make the comparison.\n\n“While I appreciate that many investors only know about the internet bubble from history books (excuse me — I mean podcasts) as opposed to life experience, this question puzzles me,” he wrote. “The dynamics of the two market environments are quite different.”\n\nAinslie, 60, said many investors are discounting the technology’s long-term potential and are misguided in their worries that the amount of cash companies are pouring into AI infrastructure won’t justify future returns.\n\n“We are only in the infancy of AI,” and each year companies will be able to better use AI to boost revenues and save capital, Ainslie wrote.\n\nCompanies that improve the speed and efficiency of AI computing infrastructure will be “extremely well-positioned to create meaningful value as demand for compute power will continue to be enormous in the coming years,” he wrote.\n\nStill, Ainslie is less optimistic about a corner of tech he thinks will fare poorly with the rise of generative AI: cloud-based application software.\n\nCompanies will spend less on that technology as they prioritize investments in generative AI instead. That shift means they’ll “substitute humans with AI processors” — painful for app software vendors that determine pricing based on the number of people their clients employ, Ainslie wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile he didn’t identify companies he’s betting against, Ainslie said short opportunities include “historically beloved names with tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization at risk.”\n\nMaverick’s main hedge fund gained 12% this year through June, while its long fund advanced almost 14%, according to the letter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Can DELL Stock Regain Momentum After 27% Dip in One Month?",
        "content": "Dell Technologies DELL shares have dropped 27.1% in the past month. It has suffered from the recent pullback in technology stocks due to rising apprehensions over AI-driven growth. \r\n\r\nDELL shares have been on a downward trajectory due to anticipated weakness in PC sales. President Joe Biden’s plan to impose harsher trade restrictions on China to limit the manufacture of powerful semiconductors has been detrimental to Dell Technologies, as well as other chip stocks like NVIDIA NVDA, AMD, ASML and Micron.\r\n\r\nPer IDC’s latest report, DELL is the only vendor that witnessed a shipment decline in the second quarter of 2024. DELL’s shipment is likely to have declined 2.4% year over year. It, along with HP HPQ, also lost market share, per the IDC report. \r\n\r\nHP (third-quarter fiscal 2024) and Dell (second-quarter fiscal 2025) are set to report their quarterly results on Aug 28 and 29, respectively.\n\nDell Stock Rides on Strong Portfolio, Partner Base\n\nYear to date, Dell Technologies shares have returned 30.6%, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 15.2% and the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s gain of 13.1%.\r\n\r\nExcept for NVIDIA, Dell Technologies shares have outperformed peers, including HP, Apple AAPL, Hewlett Packard and Lenovo.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDELL’s outperformance can be primarily attributed to the strong demand for AI servers driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI (GenAI) applications. \r\n\r\nDell AI Factory launch has been a key catalyst. It combines Dell Technologies solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Hugging Face.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies is benefiting from an expanding partner base. NVIDIA has played a pivotal role in developing the Dell AI Factory. The collaboration integrates Dell Technologies’ portfolio with NVIDIA’s AI Enterprise software platform and Tensor Core GPUs, enhancing compute power and simplifying AI application development and deployment for faster time to value.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies is collaborating with NVIDIA to build an AI Factory for Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s xAI, which is planning to build a supercomputer by fall next year. It is going to assemble half of the racks for this supercomputer, while the other half will be built by Supermicro.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies and Ericsson are collaborating to develop tailored network cloud infrastructure plans and advise communications service providers on their cloud transformation journeys. The commercial introduction of Ericsson Cloud RAN software on Dell PowerEdge servers with continuous testing and lifecycle management is noteworthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong AI Shipment to Aid Top-line Growth\n\nDell has shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the past three quarters. It expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2025, driven by a strong portfolio of AI-optimized solutions and an expanding partner base. \r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, Dell expects revenues between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion, indicating growth of 8% year over year at the mid-point of $95.5 billion. It expects the Infrastructure Solutions Group to grow by more than 20%, fueled by AI.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $96.76 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 9.43%. \r\n\r\nDell expects operating expenses to decline by low single digits for the fiscal year, thereby benefiting the bottom line. Earnings are expected to be $7.65 per share (+/- 25 cents), up 7% at the mid-point for fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Dell’s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.82 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and indicating 9.68% year-over-year growth.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. Price and Consensus Dell Technologies Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nDell Technologies Inc. price-consensus-chart | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote\n\nDELL Shares Undervalued\n\nThe Value Style Score of B suggests that DELL is undervalued at this moment. \r\n\r\nDell Technologies stock is trading at a significant discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 11.34X compared with the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s 28.99X, making the stock an attractive pick for investors.\n\nP/E Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nDell’s robust portfolio and expanding partner base are key drivers that make the stock attractive for long-term investors.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Growth Style Score of D suggests that DELL’s growth prospects are lackluster in the near term. A contraction in fiscal 2025 gross margin of roughly 150 basis points is hard to ignore for growth-oriented investors.\r\n\r\nMoreover, DELL shares are trading below the 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nDELL Shares Trade Below 50-Day SMA Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDELL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. However, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Leading the AI Revolution",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Stocks That Will Change the World. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIf we were to try and summarize one of the biggest ways how to make money on the stock market, it’d include buying stocks of firms that have changed the world. The biggest and most valuable companies of today didn’t start that way, and those who had a chance to invest in them decades back are considerably well off and some are even among the richest people in the world.\n\nIn fact, the two biggest technologies that have changed the world since the 1970s are personal computing and the Internet. Within these, the former is older and started through the launch of products such as Windows and the Mac. The two companies that make these products are up by 405,920% and 166,238% on the stock market since their shares were listed. So, if you, or anyone you know, had bought $1,000 of shares back then, your investment would be worth $4 million or $1.7 million today.\n\nAlong with personal computing, the Internet is the second world changing technology that has not only reformed the way in which businesses operate and regular people live their lives but also left a slew of billionaires in its wake. Starting from the dotcom era of the 1990s, the few companies that did survive the ‘pop’ are among the largest and most valuable in the world today. These have managed to use the power of the Internet to change the way people shop and access information. The former, founded by Jeff Bezos, whose latest net worth is estimated to sit at $190 billion, is up 185,389% since its stock started trading.\n\nA $1,000 investment back then would be worth $1.9 million. Similarly, the world’s largest search engine company and the world’s biggest social media firm, are up by 5,939% and 1,254% since their stock started trading in the 2000s. It’s a testament to the power of world changing technologies to drive stock prices that these quad digit percentage returns appear to be ‘meager’ when compared to the six digit returns of the world changing stocks that have been trading since the 1970s and the 1990s.\n\nBut what about 2024? After all, while these disruptive stocks have made their mark on Wall Street history, it is highly unlikely that they will yield similar returns in the future. Well, one disruptive technology that has caught the world by storm is artificial intelligence. Spurred by the public launch of the chatbot ChatGPT, AI’s proponents swear that it will transform the world just like the Internet did. This transformation is being spearheaded by big tech, as the largest technology companies in the world fork out billions of dollars in AI spending.\n\nData shows that during the first half of 2024, the four biggest AI players spent a whopping $106 billion in spending as part of a game theory-esque roulette that Mark Zuckerberg described as risking “building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.” As for the future, analysts expect that AI spending over the next five years could touch a whopping $1 trillion. This spending has also driven the shares of the world’s pre eminent AI GPU maker (and the youngest game changing stock) to rise by 261,775% since they started trading.\n\nLooking at these gains makes it even more important that we try to wager a guess at what future industries can change the world. One way to somewhat simplify our research is to look at what investment newsletters are saying. The writers of these newsletters are often on the hunt for high growth sectors since correctly identifying them leads to a boost of credibility that drives subscriptions and eventually leads to revenue. On this front, we looked at some such industries as part of our coverage of 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\n\nWithin these industries, two that stand out are quantum computing and nuclear energy. For those out of the loop, quantum computing is an expansion of current computing as it significantly increases the data that a computer can compute. However, quantum computing stocks are laggards in the stock market. We covered top hedge fund quantum computing stock picks during our coverage of 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In. Out of these 12 stocks, 10 either have quantum computing returns baked into their stock price or are too important in the industry to ignore. Analyzing their year to date performance reveals that out of these ten quantum computing stocks, four are in the green and this drops to three if we focus only on pureplay quantum computing stocks. These three stocks rank 5th, 7th, and 12th on our list, and they are up by 2.7% to 129.75%, year to date.\n\nFor nuclear energy, let’s look at the stocks that are part of the list of the 12 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Buy Today. In this list, roughly seven nuclear energy stocks have considerable exposure to power generation. Their one year share price appreciation ranges between 79.8% to 11.38%, and the top three performing stocks are ranked 3rd, 5th, and 12th. As a refresher, nuclear energy is popular these days because of its potential to provide clean energy to AI data centers.\n\nFinally, another sector that might change the world is robotics. Some Wall Street analysts are gushing over the sector as they believe that humanoid robots in particular can unlock a $30 trillion opportunity. This is on the back of these robots being able to perform jobs that humans are unwilling or unsuited for, and even Elon Musk is bullish on them as he believes that his car company could benefit from this unstoppable demand and become worth $25 trillion as a result. For more details, you can check out $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that can change the world, we started with our coverage of 10 Stocks That Will Change the Future, analyzed their performance, and fine tuned the list to align with today’s hottest industries. Then, we scanned media reports for sectors such as AI, self driving, gene editing, weight loss drugs, and robotics. From these reports, a stock was chosen if it was mentioned in three or more reports. This yielded a final list of five new stocks.\n\nFor these stocks, we have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q1 2024: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the most popular stock in the media when it comes world changing technologies. This is because it can transform the world through artificial intelligence and robotics, according to media reports. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers products such as its GR00T model to make AI powered humanoid robots and the Thor system on chip processor for robots.\n\nThis means that the firm provides an end to end platform that directly targets the robotics industry and is more relevant than say, Rockwell Automation’s products. On the AI front, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s GPUs are industry leaders in performance and offer users the key ability to fine tune performance via CUDA. At the same time, the firm’s AI leadership, which has also led to a tight GPU supply and higher prices, could spur big tech into action and develop its own products to relieve some of the pressure. Additionally, any worries about product execution, as evidenced by the recent reports of Blackwel GPU delays, could lead to headwinds for the shares.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s management shared details for Blackwell during the Q1 2025 earnings call:\n\n“At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling.\n\nBlackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper’s launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads and data center environments in the first year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics and digital biology.”\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of stocks that will change the world. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Was Cathie Wood Right About NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nCathie Wood’s flagship fund is continuing to face steep losses amid a broader pullback in technology stocks. Wood’s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\n\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\n\nCathie Wood Says “Something Is Changing” and the Fed is Now on “High Alert”\n\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a latest video on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a “cathartic” phase and “something is changing.”\n\n“I do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.”\n\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\n“Interest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.”\n\nCathie Wood’s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter. For this article we scanned the fund’s latest portfolio and picked 11 AI stocks it has positions in. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Cathie Wood’s Favorite AI Stock?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nCathie Wood’s Latest Stake Value: $51,601,052\n\nCathie Wood missed on the NVDA opportunity as she sold about 62% of her stake in the last quarter of 2022, when the AI rally was just getting started. As of the end of June, she still owns a $51.6 million stake in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Automation Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other automation stocks.\n\n2023 was the year of generative AI, mainly because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and the resulting response that followed. Now, 2024 is the year in which companies have truly started using this ever-evolving technology. McKinsey revealed that AI supported the companies in both aspects: cost decreases and revenue jumps.\n\nAutomation Technologies- Key Trends\n\nIn 2024, the integration of automation technologies continues to revolutionize every aspect of supply chain management. This led to unprecedented levels of efficiency and agility. The global integrated automated supply chain is expected to reach US$25.6 billion by 2033, from US$13.4 billion in 2023, according to industry data by Market.us.\n\nFrom removing warehousing bottlenecks to inventory management and demand forecasting, supply chain automation reshaped traditional practices and redefined the dynamics of the logistics industry.  In inventory tracking, advanced warehouse management systems, which are powered by AI and ML algorithms, focus on optimizing inventory placement, route planning, resource allocation, etc.\n\nInventory tracking and management are being revolutionized through the usage of automation solutions, such as RFID tagging, barcode scanning, and computer vision. Real-time tracking technologies are offering granular visibility in inventory movements. This allows businesses to monitor stock levels, spot discrepancies, and manage understocking/overstocking. Manufacturers are now getting inclined towards smart factories.\n\nSmart factories reflect and demonstrate Industry 4.0 principles. They tend to leverage 5G, IoT, AI, and other advanced technologies. Experts believe that smart factories allow predictive maintenance and decision-making.\n\nAdoption of Advanced Automation\n\nA new theme is emerging in the field of automation, which is automated decision-making. Its adoption rapidly expanded beyond traditional sectors such as manufacturing and logistics. Demand for decision intelligence stems from data-driven and well-informed decision-making requirements which enhances corporate competitiveness and efficiency.\n\nAutomated decision-making is now being accepted by critical domains including healthcare and finance. In healthcare, automation supplements the clinical decision-making processes, improves patient-care delivery, and manages resource allocation. It involves leveraging AI and ML algorithms to assess patient data, medical images, and genomic sequences, and customize patient care.\n\nStory continues\n\nLikewise, in finance, automated systems continue to reshape top-notch operations like risk assessment, fraud detection, and investment management. AI algorithms assess large datasets of financial transactions and market trends to optimize investment strategies. In 2024, the software development industry is all set to embark on a remarkable transformation with cutting-edge innovations.\n\nQuantum Computing and Robotics\n\nThe latest technologies in software that are expected to reshape the landscape include quantum computing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),big data, data analytics, 5G technology, robotics, etc.\n\nQuantum computing continues to rapidly advance, evolve, and reshape scientific and industrial landscapes. Unlike classical computers—which use bits as the smallest information unit—quantum computers make use of qubits. These exploit quantum mechanics principles to perform complex and difficult calculations. For example, at the time of drug discovery, quantum algorithms simulate molecular interactions in a more accurate and refined way as compared to traditional methods. The integration of quantum computing with AI is another critical emerging trend.\n\nThe unprecedented advancements in robotics and AI are expected to bring revolutionary positive transformations. More and more sectors continue to understand the benefits of adopting robotics and AI. Globally, the robotics market should achieve healthy revenue growth, with a projected value of US$38.24 billion this year. The strongest segment in the robotics market is expected to be service robotics, which should lead in market volume. Service robotics find its application in sectors, like Healthcare, Medical, Military and Defense, Logistics, etc. while industrial robots are used in Automotive, Electronics, Food & Beverage, etc.\n\nThe trends driving the robotics market are supported by developments in emerging technologies. These include 5G, AI, Edge Computing, IIoT, cloud, open-source, etc. Since AI in robotics continues to evolve, more and more industries are exploiting the latest technologies. Therefore, manufacturers are making data-driven decisions. Some industries use self-learning robots to execute work processes.\n\nSmart factories are using AI-enabled robotics to execute smarter, reliable, and efficient processes. They help in production optimization. AI-powered robotic technologies, which include computer vision and tactile sensing, are utilized to help automate certain tasks. For example, reinforcement learning is used for better industrial assembly. The adoption of robotics, smart automation, and high-tech manufacturing will help workers with manual labor and reduce repetitive tasks.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best Automation Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 33.65%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms.\n\nRecently, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stated that leaders in robot development continue to adopt the NVIDIA Isaac™ robotics platform. This platform finds its application in research, development, and production of the next generation of Al-enabled autonomous machines and robots. BYD Electronics, Siemens, Teradyne Robotics, and Intrinsic, which is an Alphabet Company, are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics Platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots.\n\nIn another development, Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) plans to use NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s artificial intelligence software in autonomous mobile robots. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) will integrate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Al robot development platform, dubbed Isaac, in its Otto autonomous mobile robots. This is meant for manufacturing facilities.\n\nShares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a decline of over ~18% over the past 1 month. Much of this decline came after reports emerged claiming that the Biden administration might put further restrictions on the exports of semiconductor equipment to Chinese markets. Apart from this, uncertain macroeconomic news (Bank of Japan increasing interest rates, disappointing employment numbers for July, etc.) weighed over broader market sentiments, pressuring NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock. There was also news that the company’s launch of chips, which are based on new Blackwell architecture, might get delayed by ~3 months due to design flaws.\n\nWall Street analysts believe that this short-term news should not shake the long-term view of the company’s performance. The Biden administration has not put any sort of restrictions up until now.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) recently announced that it plans to ramp up the production of Blackwell chips in 2H 2024. Experts believe that the company’s current-generation Hopper chips should still sell strongly by 2024 end. By that time, Blackwell chips can become a strong contributor to its sales.\n\nAnalysts at Argus upped their target price on the company’s shares from $110.00 to $150.00. They gave a “Buy” rating on 11th June. As per Insider Monkey’s 1Q 2024 data, 186 hedge funds had stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nPatient Capital Management released its second quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Here is what the firm said:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year.

With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best automation stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Summer has proven itself to be a wild season for markets, with high highs, low lows, and serious talk of more volatility and woes.\n\nBut the recent market slide doesn’t mean investors should call it a day and pull all their money out of markets.\n\n\"Consider potential opportunities during periods of crisis or dislocation,” Kathryn Kaminski, chief research strategist of AlphaSimplex told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (watch video above or listen here).\n\nThe former visiting scientist at MIT’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering studied markets, trading, and emotions. She also has firsthand experience with financial crises and investor reactions; she began her investment career in 2008 in a world reeling from the Great Recession.\n\nRather than react rashly, “the key thing right now is to watch the data and see if this could be a real crisis that unfolds where we have a bigger recessionary move,” she added.\n\nKaminski says it's good practice to stick with key investing themes such as AI, with a longer-term perspective.\n\nTo be sure, calm guidance from Kaminski is being put to the test this month.\n\nMarkets saw a surprise, mass sell-off on August 5 as fears of slowing US growth and the unwind of the Yen carry trade rocked sentiments.\n\nThe day saw Dow Jones Industrial Average lose 2.6%, the S&P 500 tanked 3%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 3%.\n\nAll three major indices are still trading below their mid-July record highs, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nThe same for popular names like Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock is off by 13% since mid-July.\n\nIn June, Kaminski says, she “started to get concerned” when markets “started to see some pretty severe cross-asset sell-offs.\" Remarking that commodities moved from long to short signals and bonds moved from short to long signals, “both of these are classic risk-off potential recession trades,” she said.\n\n“Corrections often hint that a crisis could be impending,” Kaminski acknowledges, even though she is on the hunt for those aforementioned solid investable themes.\n\nUltimately knowing where to turn is anybody’s guess as September comes into view.\n\nIn an August 12 client note, Mislav Matejka, head of global equity strategy for J.P. Morgan, warned of potential further weakness as summer continues.\n\nThe laundry list of worries includes weakening economic activity, a resumption of negative earnings revisions, elevated geopolitical uncertainty, and concentration risk.\n\nMatejka calls out that the Fed “will start cutting, but this might be seen as reactive and behind the curve.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“Lean on diversification,” Kaminski says.\n\nSounds about correct for this topsy turvy environment.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Arista Networks, NetApp and NVIDIA",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 14, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, NetApp, Inc. NTAP and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nMarket Volatility Continues: 4 Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip\n\nLast week, Wall Street witnessed one of the most eventful weeks in 2024. Markets were rattled on Aug 5, following the release of disappointing July payrolls data, reigniting fears that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nHowever, stocks have recovered most of the losses since then in a dramatic rebound that has greatly fizzled fears of a recession in the near term, following the release of a fresh jobless claims report that came in better than expected. However, the market volatility is far from over.\n\nOn Aug 5, the Dow gave up more than 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 finished 3% lower to record its worst day since 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 3.4%. The massive selloff was sparked by fears that the Fed may have held interest rates higher for too long, which has started taking its toll on the economy.\n\nTech stocks, which were so long driving the market rally, were the worst suffers of last week's market rout, with $1.5 billion of market capitalization being wiped out of the \"magnificent 7\" stocks.\n\nHowever, markets have since made a solid rebound. On Aug 8, all three major indexes rallied, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq jumping 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The S&P recorded its best close since November 2022.\n\nOnce again, the rally was driven by tech stocks. Markets closed the week on a high, recovering nearly all the earlier losses. However, the volatility is far from over as the Federal Reserve said that it will closely monitor inflation data before going ahead with the rate cuts.\n\nInflation has declined sharply over the past couple of months and investors are now awaiting the key consumer price index (CPI) reading for July.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is gearing up for its rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 25-50 basis point rate cut in September, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nLower interest rates typically help growth stocks, particularly tech stocks. Given this situation, it would be a wise decision to buy stocks at a bargain.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have chosen four top-ranked tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., NetApp, Inc. and NVIDIA Corp. that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world's largest social media platform. META's portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions.\n\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.5% over the past 60 days. META currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nArista Networks, Inc. is engaged in providing cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments. ANET offers 10/25/40/50/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches and routers optimized for the next-generation data center networks. Arista uses multiple silicon architectures across its products.\n\nArista Networks' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 4% over the past 60 days. ANET presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetApp, Inc. provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. NTAP assists enterprises in managing multiple clouds environments, adopting next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Kubernetes, and contemporary databases, and navigating the complexity brought about by the quick development of data and cloud usage.\n\nNetApp's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.6% over the past 60 days. NTAP presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA's focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.4% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Analysts Think NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is the Best Beaten-Down AI Stock to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Analyst Ratings. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nInvestors remain cautious following a major global selloff that shook the markets last week on recession fears. Analyst warnings around sky-high CapEx of tech companies and lack of visibility over returns are also expected to keep tech valuations in check in the coming weeks.\n\nLast month, Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, while talking to CNBC, highlighted a report from Goldman Sachs that said returns of AI investments might fail to meet investors’ expectations.\n\n“The amount of capital investment in this sector, which is billions of dollars now, is so large that it’s almost unimaginable that we are going to get a rate of return over the next few years that justifies the amount of investment,”  McNamee said.\n\nTalking to Bloomberg, JPMorgan Asset Management’s Aisa Ogoshi said that there is some “adjustment” coming for tech stocks as she expects the AI-centric rally to diversify to other sectors.\n\n“The key is to keep an eye on the earnings trends. It’s easy to  panic in these times but really, just sit down and look at the numbers and reassess our positioning.”\n\nAsked whether she plans to reduce exposure to AI stocks in the coming days, the analyst said she’d be more “selective” when it comes to AI plays and will increase the quality of stocks in the portfolio.\n\nFor this article, we chose 11 trending AI stocks based on the latest news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Trending AI Stock On Latest News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nBofA said in a latest note that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the tech stocks presenting an attractive buy-the-dip opportunity.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 11 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Receding AI Stock Euphoria Has Bulls Seeing Some Opportunities",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Skeptics had long warned that artificial intelligence-related stocks were in a bubble. Now that some of the froth has come off, bulls see an opportunity.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Manchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\n\nShares in makers of AI hardware and infrastructure — including Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer Inc., ARM Holdings Plc. and Nvidia Corp. — have come under huge selling pressure in recent months, bringing their valuations back down to earth. And with most of their big customers planning to continue spending billions of dollars on AI, some say that it’s time to selectively get back in.\n\n“The AI moves were certainly dramatic, but they’ve moved back to where they can stabilize for the balance of the year,” said Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management. “Momentum indicators have gone from overbought to oversold, and now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions.”\n\nThe combination of lower multiples and enduring AI demand — demonstrated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s robust July sales — suggests that the worst may be over for AI hardware. And there are already signs of a rebound: Nvidia shares are up 17% from an August low, while Bank of America Corp.’s most recent client data showed inflows into tech for the first week in four.\n\n“The excess appears to be wrung out,” according to Truist Advisory Services co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner. He recently upgraded tech stocks, writing that “in a cooling economic environment, we expect investors to come back to tech given some of the secular tailwinds stemming from artificial intelligence and its premium growth prospects.”\n\nUpcoming results from Dell and Nvidia will be a crucial test of whether the selloff is really over. Dell, which became a market darling because of its high-powered servers that can run AI workloads, saw its stock plunge more than 50% from a May high to last week’s low, leaving its forward earnings multiple cheaper than the S&P 500.\n\n“The euphoria in Dell has come off, and it is a real, diversified business that has long demonstrated consistent earnings growth, which makes it a more attractive way to play the space,” said Derek Schug, head of portfolio management at Kestra Investment Management. Analysts at Barclays agree — they upgraded the stock on Tuesday, saying the selloff has removed AI hype from the valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, there’s an ongoing debate about how to value the future AI opportunity for hardware names. That’s been encapsulated by data center server maker Super Micro, which more than quadrupled in market value in the first weeks of 2024 before the shares collapsed almost 60% as investors questioned whether the move was justified.\n\nThe company’s quarterly report last week offered fodder for both bulls and bears. While results missed estimates, causing a sharp selloff, its sales forecast for the year blew past expectations. The shares, which are now trading at less than half of their 2024 peak of more than 40 times forward earnings, have been bouncing back for the past few days.\n\nBut even after the recent selloffs, some may see AI hardware valuations as too steep. Arm is the most expensive stock in the Nasdaq 100 in terms of forward sales, while Nvidia is in third place.\n\nAnd with customers like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. under pressure to show that their AI investments are paying off, there are concerns that spending may slow in future quarters.\n\nCurrent capex plans bode well for AI-related hardware, but “there has been greater skepticism around the near-term return on investment from the massive increase in capex, essentially creating worries of a demand ‘cliff’ in the next 12-18 months,” according to DJ Cross, portfolio manager at American Century Investments.\n\n“We will likely have to live with the increased volatility.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nIntel Corp. is on track for its worst year since at least 1983, tumbling 59% and erasing $125 billion in market value. The rout means that the chipmaker’s market value is now hovering at 2009 levels — valuing the firm at about $87 billion. The latest selloff came after the company’s forecast for third-quarter revenue missed the average analyst estimate.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nIntel, which is slashing jobs and expenses in a bid to turn around the business, sold its holdings in chip technology creator Arm Holdings during the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing. Apple Inc.’s main manufacturing partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. said it expects revenue to grow in the current quarter and for the rest of year, after reporting a profit rise boosted by demand for servers powering AI applications. A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations. Sea Ltd.’s shares rose their most since March 2023 after raising its online retail sales outlook, suggesting the Southeast Asia e-commerce leader is successfully countering hard-charging rivals TikTok and Lazada.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPremarket\n\nRiskified Postmarket\n\nCisco Lumentum\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Kamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?

        "content": "It's been a wild couple of weeks for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader have moved by 5% in seemingly every session as investors struggle to value the dominant data center GPU maker.\n\nNvidia shares soared since the start of 2023 as its hardware is fueling the generative AI boom. Now there are legitimate questions about the economy's strength, the potential influence of AI, and how quickly Nvidia can grow.\n\nConsequently, the stock has fallen 23% since the Nasdaq Composite peaked a month ago. However, one analyst sees the sell-off as a buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNew Street Research calls Nvidia a buy\n\nLast week, New Street Research upgraded its rating on Nvidia from neutral in response to the sell-off. The research firm noted the stock had fallen 26% from its June peak, underperforming peers that are also competing in data center AI.\n\nIt sees the sell-off as a buying opportunity and gave the AI stock a price target of $120, implying upside potential of 15%.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nNvidia shares have pulled back as the AI rally became overheated, but there's a good argument that the stock is oversold. The brief scare over a potential economic recession seems to have passed for now. Nvidia's momentum remains strong, though the company may be experiencing a delay in its new Blackwell platform.\n\nThe latest update from Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation, the world's biggest chip manufacturer, showed July revenue that increased 45% from a year ago and 24% from June, a sign that the last month of Nvidia's second quarter was strong in the semiconductor industry and for AI chips.\n\nNvidia will report second-quarter earnings at the month's end and looks set to deliver another round of strong growth. After the recent pullback, the stock looks more reasonable at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 40.\n\nIf market sentiment improves and Nvidia's second-quarter numbers are strong, the stock could be significantly higher by the month's end. Over the longer term, the stock should continue to outperform if it can retain its AI leadership.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Market Meltdown or Massive Opportunity? 7 Stocks to Watch",
        "content": "Every investor is well aware of the volatility sweeping the markets over the past few weeks. The same investors are trying to understand whether a market meltdown or massive opportunity is ahead. While no one knows with 100% accuracy there are several stocks investors should watch to get a better grasp of the future market direction.\n\nThese stocks represent certain narratives and overarching trends moving the markets. Certain classes and categories of stocks will perform better during this period of volatility. Investors can better position themselves by understanding those broad movements and their repercussions.\n\nWhether the current period is a market meltdown or a massive opportunity remains to be seen. As I write this the S&P 500 is up by nearly 2.5% on the day. It fell by nearly as much the day before.  Recession fears, employment data, Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and more are making the market exceptionally volatile. Current volatility is an extension of overall volatility that has increased in the modern era. With that said, let’s make sense of current volatility through the lens of seven stocks to watch.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA logo on phone and blurred AI chip on the background. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlan on continued volatility in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. The company –  arguably the world’s most important – is set to release earnings on August 28. In 2024 Nvidia’s shares have appreciated by as much as 185%. They’ve corrected over the last month, falling by nearly 20% as fears around artificial intelligence reach a fever pitch. Year-to-date gains now stand at approximately 110%.\n\nThe central theme of upcoming volatility over the next few weeks will be the release of Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chips. There’s a lot of controversy around that delay. When the news was released some analysts reacted negatively while others claimed Nvidia’s dominance made any delay a non-event. Days after the rumor began to spread, Nvidia flat-out denied any such issues.\n\nNvidia instead noted that sampling of the chips has begun and an H2 production ramp-up is on track. The conflicting claims set up a period of market intrigue over the next few weeks in the lead-up to earnings on August 28. Nvidia looks likely to continue to rebound given its claims about Blackwell production and the fact that many analysts are bullish should any delays occur.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap stocks including Wolfspeed (NASDAQ:WOLF) deserve investor attention at the moment. The upcoming Fed pivot in September should catalyze small-cap stocks higher again as it did in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nWolfspeed is a small-cap firm that didn’t particularly benefit from the July rotation into small caps and away from large-cap tech. However, due to likely September rate cuts and its unique business, Wolfspeed is a stock to consider buying.\n\nWolfspeed is a leader in the high-tech growth industry. The company is a leader in the silicon carbide (SiC) market. SiC is a material with superior properties relative to the silicon commonly used throughout the semiconductor industry. Silicon carbide has higher thermal conductivity and can operate at higher voltages and temperatures than traditional silicon.\n\nThat has led many to believe that Wolf Speed is a massive emerging opportunity with a first-mover advantage through its leadership position in the material. Silicon carbide chips have applications in growth markets including EVs, 5G, IoT and more. While it’s easy to see Wolfspeed’s appeal given those facts, losses are growing at the firm. It’ll benefit greatly from cheaper lending soon so for bold investors Wolfspeed could be a huge opportunity.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Close-up of Coca Cola drink cans lying on paper background. KO stock\n\nSource: Tetiana Shumbasova / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Coca-Cola’s (NYSE:KO) stock has thrived over the last month as fears over a market meltdown increased. The company has become one of the most well-known defensive positions and a bastion of safety during market turbulence. The earnings machine seems to weather any storm long or short.\n\nThe most recent storm over the last month has seen KO shares rise by 9%. Despite the strong performance investors have reason to believe KO shares won’t rise much further.  I say that because a technical indicator, the relative strength index, indicates that KO shares are overbought at the moment. The so-called RSI Is considered to indicate overbought territory at a level of 70 or higher. Coca-Cola’s shares currently have an RSI above 97.\n\nThat’s a reasonable indication that the markets will soon move away from Coca-Cola or at least fewer will move into Coca-Cola. Although KO stock has a little bit of room to go until it reaches the consensus target price, suggesting upside, those who wait for prices to fall will benefit from higher dividend yields. The current RSI suggests that may be a better option.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going to continue to be one of the most interesting trades in the stock market as it commercializes AI. Shares have performed very well since the June 10  introduction of its AI, called Apple Intelligence. That was, up until the last few weeks as the broader AI play lost steam.\n\nWhile Apple was late to the game and its timing arguably unfortunate, there’s a lot to like about AAPL in the $210s. First of all, the consensus price for the stock is nearly $240 with some analysts believing it could reach $300.\n\nAll of that upside is predicated upon the successful launch of Apple Intelligence. Apple intelligence will require iOS 18 set to launch in September. However, Apple intelligence will not be available at the launch of iOS 18. Instead, it will be available with later updates of iOS 18.\n\nUsers will need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to access those AI features. Apple is likely to charge $20 for access to its most advanced AI features.\n\nThe point here for investors is that Apple is likely to receive a spike in revenues due to iPhone upgrades, Apple Intelligence subscriptions, and a boost to consumer spending as rate cuts are enacted.\n\nUFP Technologies (UFPT) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nUFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT) is another small-cap stock to watch. As noted earlier in this article, there is an ongoing rotation into small-cap stocks. My colleague Joel Baglole noted that the rotation lost momentum since the beginning of August but that UFP Technologies Is one of the more interesting small-cap plays.\n\nThe stock is up nearly 650% over the past five years and more than 82% in 2024 alone. The company recently released earnings that once again bested expectations. Revenues and earnings per share both came in much better than expected.\n\nThe medical devices firm is very well positioned to grow rapidly. UFP Technologies has been on an acquisition spree of late Acquiring three companies in July ending with the July 16 acquisition of Marble Medical.\n\nThose acquisitions – combined with lower lending rates – could catalyze the company into another level of growth spiking prices in the process, making it one of the stocks to watch.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) will continue to be one of the most interesting firms to watch as the following weeks in the stock market unfold.\n\nInvestors are already aware of how quickly Palantir has evolved into a profitable firm and one that is squarely entrenched in the enterprise AI opportunity. A lot has been said about that but the thrust of it is that Palantir continues to prove its doubters wrong.\n\nThe company has been profitable for over a year and continues to be. It is also quickly emerging as a commercially oriented AI firm providing an in-demand AI platform to the private sector. Beyond that, Palantir is a well-known public side firm with deep ties to the government. Those ties are getting stronger as the company just announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to bring AI to government agencies.\n\nThat sent Palantir stock surging higher by 10% during intraday trading. It’s highly likely that Palantir will continue to grow among stocks to watch given its strengthening ties in the public side and rapid growth commercially.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nInvestors should avoid Pinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) over the coming weeks and months. The reasoning for that assertion is relatively straightforward and is related to recent Q2 earnings results.\n\nResults themselves were actually strong with pinterests revenues coming in 1% higher than anticipated. However, the markets are always forward looking. Unfortunately, Pinterest projects Q3 growth in the range of 16 to 18%. Analysts were looking for 19% at the consensus level.\n\nSo, it’s clear that Pinterest will have a lot of work to do this quarter in trying to assuage fears of slowing growth. That is not the only issue confronting the firm nor is it the only reason to believe the stock will trade sideways or worse.\n\nPinterest shares are more expensive than all but 8% of the competition based on its P/E ratio. That P/E ratio is currently at the 10-year median level. However, Pinterest doesn’t look particularly strong at the moment so I see no reason to assume investors will want to buy it at these prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stocks Are All the Rage on Wall Street -- But Only 1 Is a Clear-Cut Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Wall Street seemingly has two loves at the moment: anything that has to do with artificial intelligence (AI) and companies conducting stock splits. What you might not realize is that these two trends are intersecting for a trio of companies.\n\nA stock split is a tool publicly traded companies have at their disposal that allows them to alter their share price and outstanding share count. Keep in mind that these changes are purely superficial, with stock splits not affecting a company's market cap or its underlying operating performance.\n\nThough stock splits come in two varieties -- forward (reducing the nominal share price) and reverse (increasing the nominal share price) -- most investors tend to flock to companies completing forward-stock splits. Since high-flying businesses are out-innovating and out-executing their competition, forward splits are almost always being conducted from a position of operating strength. This can rarely be said for publicly traded companies enacting reverse-stock splits.\n\nOver the trailing-six-month period, 13 prominent businesses have announced or completed a stock split, all but one of which was of the forward-split variety. Three of these completed or anticipated stock-split stocks are companies leading the charge for the artificial intelligence revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia, Broadcom, and Super Micro Computer have all declared historic stock splits\n\nThe excitement surrounding the rise of AI is palpable. According to the analysts at PwC, AI is forecast to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. This enormous addressable market suggests there can be multiple big-time winners thanks to this leap forward in technology.\n\nOn May 22, hardware leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) kicked things off by declaring a 10-for-1 forward split -- the largest forward split in its history. Shortly after its split was effected following the close of trading on June 7, Nvidia's stock would touch a market cap of $3.46 trillion, which briefly made it the most-valuable publicly traded company on Earth.\n\nNvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) has become the standard in high-compute enterprise data centers looking to train large language models (LLMs) and run generative AI solutions. A veritable market share monopoly on the \"brains\" behind AI-accelerated data centers, coupled with exceptionally strong pricing power due to AI-GPU scarcity, has powered Nvidia's stock higher.\n\nAI networking specialist Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) was next in line to join the \"Class of 2024\" stock-split club. The company's board approved a 10-for-1 split (its first-ever) on June 12, with an effective date following the close of business on July 12.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom's networking solutions (e.g., the Jericho3-AI fabric) have gained notoriety for connecting large numbers of AI-GPUs in enterprise data centers in order to reduce tail latency and ensure that businesses are getting as much compute capacity as possible out of these chips. In other words, Broadcom is helping to further expedite the split-second decision-making that's needed of AI-driven software and systems.\n\nLastly, customizable rack server and storage specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) joined the club by announcing its first-ever stock split on Aug. 6, also 10-for-1, which'll go into effect after the close of trading on September 30.\n\nSuper Micro's server solutions have been in high demand as businesses build out the physical infrastructure necessary to train LLMs, runs generative AI solutions, accelerate quantum computing, and so much more. Super Micro more than doubled its sales in fiscal 2024 (ended June 30) to $14.94 billion, and is widely expected by analysts to generate sales growth of 75% to north of $26 billion in the current fiscal year.\n\nTwo of these three AI stock-split stocks aren't worth buying\n\nBut in spite of the euphoria surrounding stock-split stocks, not all leading businesses involved with the AI revolution are worth buying.\n\nThe harsh reality of next-big-thing innovations is that they have a history of disappointment. Over the last three decades, every buzzy innovation, technology, or trend that lured investors in with big dollar signs succumbed to an eventual early stage bubble.\n\nThe reason bubbles continually form on Wall Street when new technologies or trends arrive is because investors (both professional and retail) have a habit of overestimating how quickly new innovations will be adopted and utilized. Investors are consistently overoptimistic and fail to take into account that innovations, technologies, and trends all need time to mature.\n\nOne of the telltale signs that artificial intelligence isn't close to being a mature technology is the lack of concrete plans offered by tech companies as to how they'll use AI to grow their sales and increase their profits. While select companies may have some broad stroke expectations in place, the vast majority of businesses lack a true AI game plan. This all but ensures the AI bubble is going to burst at some point in the future.\n\nIf history is accurate and the AI bubble does burst, no company would be hit harder than Nvidia. The bulk of its valuation gains and recent sales growth have come on the heels of its AI hardware and AI-GPU scarcity. Once this scarcity wanes, which should be expected as external and internal competition for data center \"real estate\" picks up, Nvidia's stock could have a long way to fall.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is in a similar predicament. Almost the entirety of its recent sales leap has been based on businesses building out their data centers. If the AI bubble bursts, or if businesses come to the realization that they don't understand how generate a positive return on their AI investment, Super Micro's future server orders, and its stock, are going to suffer.\n\nTo add, Super Micro's rack servers incorporate Nvidia's leading H100 GPUs, which are currently backlogged. The longer supply constraints exist, the more likely it is that Super Micro will fail to live up to its potential. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis is the only AI stock-split stock worth buying right now\n\nAmong Wall Street's trio of AI stock-split stocks, Broadcom is the cream of the crop from an investment standpoint.\n\nWhile it's true that Broadcom has notably benefited from an increase in demand for its AI-driven networking solutions, it had an extensive and diverse revenue stream, complete with a mammoth backlog, prior to the emergence of artificial intelligence as the hottest thing on Wall Street.\n\nFor example, Broadcom is one of the leading providers of wireless chips, along with other accessories, used in next-generation smartphones. Telecom companies spending big bucks to upgrade their wireless networks to support 5G download speeds have spurred a multiyear device upgrade cycle that's lifted demand for Broadcom's wireless solutions.\n\nBroadcom has its fingers in multiple cookie jars beyond smartphones, as well. It provides financial services software, cybersecurity solutions, and optical products used in next-gen vehicles and industrial equipment, to name just a few things.\n\nBroadcom's management team has also used acquisitions as a means to expand the company's product and service ecosystem and grow its bottom line. This includes the acquisition of cybersecurity solutions provider Symantec in 2019, as well as the $69 billion deal to purchase VMware in November 2023. Buying VMware is particularly important to furthering Broadcom's strategy of helping businesses overcome the challenges of customizing private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments.\n\nThe key point here is that the potential bursting of the AI bubble doesn't turn Broadcom's world upside down in the same way that it would for Nvidia and Super Micro Computer. While Broadcom would, almost certainly, see AI networking sales slow or contract, many of its other sales channels would be unaffected.\n\nAt 24 times forward-year earnings, Broadcom is, admittedly, not the steal of a deal it was as recently as two years ago. But with its earnings per share expected to grow by an annualized rate of 18% over the next five years, its valuation offers room for multiple expansion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After Aug. 28",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a $2.6 trillion company, and it currently represents 5.8% of the value of the S&P 500 index. In June, Nvidia stock was sitting on a 150% year-to-date gain, which was responsible for one-third of the entire return in the S&P 500.\n\nBoth Nvidia and the index have been in a slump since mid-July, but there is a seismic event coming up on Aug. 28 that could reverse both of their fortunes. It's the date Nvidia reports its financial results for the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 31), and if past quarters are any indication, it could be an absolute blowout.\n\nNvidia designs the most powerful data center chips for processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and demand from some of the world's largest tech giants continues to outstrip supply. Therefore, investors are waiting on the edge of their seats for the company's latest sales results; here's how I predict Nvidia stock will react after they hit the wires. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nNvidia dominates the market for AI data center chips\n\nNvidia's graphics processors (GPUs) for data centers set the benchmark for AI development. GPUs are designed for parallel processing, which means they can complete multiple tasks simultaneously. They can handle high throughput and typically have a significant amount of built-in memory, which makes them ideal for processing large volumes of data. That is key when it comes to training AI models and performing AI inference.\n\nAI applications could drive a productivity boom across the global economy worth trillions of dollars in the coming decade, according to many Wall Street forecasts. As a result, data center operators are replacing much of their traditional CPU-based infrastructure with GPUs to meet demand from AI developers. Nvidia's flagship H100 GPU has been the go-to choice since last year, but the company is racing to beat its own benchmarks when it comes to performance.\n\nNvidia's new H200 can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy. Then there is the GB200, which is based on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, and it could perform AI inference at a whopping 5 times the pace of the H100. Blackwell-based chips will start shipping to customers at scale in 2025.\n\nNvidia has a tight grip on the data center GPU market. It had an estimated 98% market share in 2023, and even though that will shrink this year as viable competition comes online from other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices, demand is likely to continue outstripping supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from Nvidia's upcoming quarterly report\n\nNvidia generated a record $26 billion in revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), which was a 262% increase from the year-ago period. It blew Wall Street's $24.6 billion projection right out of the water. The result included $22.6 billion in data center revenue alone, which represented 427% growth on the back of surging GPU demand.\n\nNvidia also delivered an incredible result at the bottom line, with $6.12 in earnings per share. It was a 461% increase and it came in comfortably above the Street's $5.59 prediction.\n\nWall Street also underestimated Nvidia's guidance. The company told investors it expects to show $28 billion in second-quarter revenue when it reports on Aug. 28, whereas the Street pegged that number at $26.6 billion.\n\nAnalysts have since played catch-up, and their consensus estimate has been revised higher to $28.5 billion, which signals Nvidia's own forecast might even be too conservative. We'll know for sure in two weeks.\n\nNvidia stock could soar with the help of its Q2 results\n\nWhile the performance of a stock on any given day is mostly just noise, here's how Nvidia reacted to each of its last two earnings reports:\n\nNvidia reported its results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter after the bell on Feb. 21, and its stock soared 16.4% the following day. Nvidia reported its results for the fiscal 2025 first quarter after the bell on May 22, and its stock closed 9.3% higher the following day.\n\nBut the longer-term trend is crystal clear. Nvidia was a $360 billion company at the beginning of 2023, right before AI fever swept Wall Street, and its stock has surged more than 700% since then. In other words, a string of incredible earnings reports has created sustained upward momentum in its stock price, and I think Q2 will contribute to that trend.\n\nIf Nvidia exceeds Wall Street's sales estimate, its stock could jump by at least 9% the following day, as it did after its Q1 results. The response could be even more positive given the recent dip in the stock. However, investors should be more focused on the longer term.\n\nIf Nvidia manages to deliver $3.75 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026 (which starts in February 2025) as Wall Street expects, its stock would have to soar by 108% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 58.2.\n\nGranted, that P/E ratio is quite expensive relative to the Nasdaq-100, which trades at a P/E ratio of 29.6, but it might be temporarily justifiable given Nvidia's lightning-paced growth.\n\nI say \"temporarily\" because this dream run will come to an end, eventually. Competition is growing in the market for AI data center chips, and as is the case with every technology, the further development of AI past a certain point will yield diminishing returns, which will shrink demand. It's difficult to predict exactly when that will happen, but investors should be wary of holding the stock blindly in the hope of earning the same returns Nvidia delivered in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Rebound Adds $420 Billion Market Value in Four Days",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- It’s been a rough six weeks for Nvidia Corp. shareholders. A historic dip that erased record market value from the company was followed by a four-day stretch of stomach-churning volatility. Now, though, signs are emerging the worst might be over.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test How Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares have surged 17% in the past four sessions, adding nearly $424 billion in market value to one of the biggest companies in the world. The rebound has propelled the broader market higher as well, with Nvidia accounting for roughly 22% of the S&P 500’s gain over that span, double the contribution of any other single stock. The gauge has since notched its best stretch since early July, a welcome reprieve to investors who on Aug. 5 were hit by the worst one-day rout in almost two years.\n\n“There was a lot of positive news for Nvidia out of the hyperscalers this earning season, but the carry trade impact was so massive it didn’t matter,” said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief investment officer of Spear Invest. “Now that that technical pressure has abated, there’s been a return to the fundamental story, and that’s why we’re seeing this spike.”\n\nThe rally in Nvidia took options traders who have been betting on more losses in the chipmaker off guard. The cost of protection against a 10% decline in the stock over the next 60 days is near the highest since May 2023 relative to contracts profiting from a 10% rally, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nOf course, a 17% advance in a stock that rallied more than 1,000% in 15 months before quickly giving back a quarter of the gains isn’t going to allay all the worries that caused the most recent selloff. Investors remain on edge about the health of the American economy and the wisdom of tech companies plowing hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence over the next several years with little profit to show for it.\n\nBut for now, the selloff has attracted legions of dip buyers. Hedge funds to retail investors are bullish on the long-term trajectory of artificial intelligence and may be positioning ahead of what’s expected to be a solid quarterly earnings report from Nvidia, due at the end of the month. Results from megacap technology companies so far show that some of Nvidia’s largest clients — Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — all said they plan to continue investing billions into AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe selloff also brought down Nvidia’s valuation to a level that might look more enticing to investors. Shares currently trade at about 36 times forward earnings, down from about 44 times in June. Overall, the Nasdaq 100 Index trades at about 25 times future earnings.\n\n“Even if you expect competition going forward, the valuation doesn’t look expensive,” Delevska said, adding that her preferred valuation metric, which measures equity value over earnings, is near a seven-year floor.\n\nOther beaten-down semiconductor names are also seeing investor interest Tuesday. Shares of Broadcom Inc. climbed 5.1% and have contributed the most to the Nasdaq 100’s daily gains, save for Nvidia. Applied Materials Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. all traded higher Tuesday.\n\nStill, Nvidia shares remain down about 14% from the June 18 record, the day it overtook Microsoft to briefly become the world’s most valuable company.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market close.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Kamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) surged higher on Tuesday, jumping as much as 6.2%. As of 1:33 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 5.7%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the chipmaker and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher were reports that delays of the Blackwell AI processor likely won't be as bad as originally feared.\n\nBillions at stake\n\nEarlier this month, reports suggested that Nvidia's much anticipated Blackwell B200 AI processor, which is scheduled to begin shipping later this year, would ship as much as three months late, thanks to a design flaw, according to a report that first appeared on the website The Information.\n\nWith billions of dollars in potential sales of the next-gen AI processor at stake, investors were justifiably concerned, sending the stock lower in the wake of the report.\n\nHowever, things may not be as bad as all that. Analysts at UBS have researched the matter and contend the shipments of the Blackwell chips are delayed by \"maybe four to six weeks at most, putting them at the very end of January 2025.\" Demand remains strong and will likely be filled by Nvidia's H200 processor during the shorter delay, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. UBS went on to suggest that research labs and enterprise customers alike continue to invest heavily in AI, \"both bullish indicators.\"\n\nA long road ahead\n\nIt's important for Nvidia investors to keep in mind that the company's growth -- particularly as it relates to AI -- will come in fits and starts. Furthermore, a look at Nvidia's stock chart reveals an important lesson. Even as the stock has gained 24,000% over the past decade, there have been numerous declines of 50% or more.\n\nInvestors with the ability to withstand the occasional gut-wrenching volatility that comes with owning this high-growth stock have been richly rewarded. Additionally, one must ignore the day-to-day machinations of the stock market in order to reap those rewards.\n\nNvidia might seem expensive at 42 times forward earnings, but I'd argue it's a reasonable price to pay for a company generating triple-digit growth and in pole position in the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $668,029!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "There are better stocks to buy instead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Although the chipmaker has been an absolute workhorse and promises to radically alter the artificial intelligence landscape, let’s be real and admit NVDA stock is not cheap.\n\nThe leading AI stock trades at 64 times earnings, 34 times sales, and 70 times free cash flow (FCF). Those are all nose-bleed valuations. Essentially, if you were to buy Nvidia outright, it would take you 64 years to earn back your investment through its profits. As the popular meme says, ain’t nobody got time for that!\n\nThat’s why I say there are better stocks to buy instead of Nvidia. The chipmaker is an excellent company, but there is concern that the melt-up in AI stocks may have run too far too fast. NVDA stock has fallen 22% from its recent high. As the market rotates away from former high-flying tech stocks, the following three companies just might be better for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDaVita (DVA) A DaVita (DVA) kidney care clinic in St. Joseph, Missouri.\n\nSource: APN Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDialysis treatment center DaVita (NYSE:DVA) is one of the two largest dialysis centers in the U.S. It generates almost all of its revenue and profits from the procedure and runs neck-and-neck with Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) for the claim to being top dog.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue grew 6% to almost $3.2 billion as profits soared 25% to $222 million. The total volume of U.S. dialysis treatments rose to 7.27 million, or over 93,000 treatments per day, a 1.1% increase year-over-year. DaVita is benefiting from better Medicare reimbursement rates and timing due to patients meeting their co-insurance and deductible levels.\n\nAlthough DaVita stock is up 37% year-to-date, shares trade at less than 13 times next year’s earnings estimates, a fraction of its sales, and a bargain-basement of 9x FCF. It makes the discounted stock an attractive investment for those able to see the long-term value of treating the growing incidence of diabetes.\n\nBrinker International (EAT) A photograph of a vegetarian burger.\n\nSource: barmalini/Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant owner Brinker International (NYSE:EAT) might not be as exciting as owning Nvidia stock but it is a good long-term value nonetheless. Brinker owns the Chili’s chain of Tex-Mex restaurants as well as the Maggiano’s Little Italy chain. Mexican food remains a popular trend and investors will get a taste of just how popular when the restaurateur posts earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 14.\n\nSo far, business has been popping. Fiscal third-quarter revenue rose 3.4% earlier this year to over $1.1 billion on a 3.3% increase in comparable sales. Consumers are looking to save money and are finding it within its Chili’s and Maggiano’s chains.\n\nStory continues\n\nEAT stock goes for just 14 times next year’s estimates, a fraction of its sales and 20x FCF. Shares have risen 59% in 2024 and are 78% higher in the past 12 months. Analysts expect Brinker to post earnings growth of 20% a year for the next five years.\n\nWhile the consensus price target for Brinker International is $57 per share, about 16% below where it currently trades, the high side estimate of $90 per share would imply 30% more growth potential.\n\nCactus (WHD) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocks\n\nSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil field services outfit Cactus (NYSE:WHD) is the third- better stock than Nvidia to buy. It sells pressure control equipment for wellheads as well as spoolable pipe and fittings. The energy industry was recently plagued with reduced activity, but Cactus thinks that’s behind it now. A potential headwind has been the record merger and acquisition activity in the space over the past year.\n\nWhile it shows the oil and gas majors like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) remain interested in the domestic market, fewer available companies could mean fewer customers. Yet with overall increased activity, Cactus can still grow its business.\n\nWHD stock is up 32% in 2024 yet trades at 18 times estimated earnings. With analysts forecasting 23.5% long-term earnings growth, more than double the rate it grew over the last five years, the stock is trading at a fraction to those rates.\n\nAt current prices, Cactus is a solid pick for long-term growth. The oil and gas industry has a long runway ahead and flexible pipe is a key component of tapping hard-to-reach resources. Cactus should have plenty of growth opportunities ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in XOM and CVX stock.

        "content": "Sustained, long-term earnings per share growth is the ultimate driver for growth stocks. The best way to profit and benefit from earnings growth is to search for a new technology at the beginning of its mega-trend. Innovation and industry disruption lead to earnings growth and sustained investment. Throughout history, major technological shifts like the railroad, automobile, and internet have led to the biggest winning stocks. For these reasons, investors should focus on the blossoming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI Growth Projections\n\nAccording to data from Statista, the worldwide AI market size is $184 billion. With AI-related companies like Nvidia (NVDA) up some 2,778% over the past five years, investors may feel like they missed the move in AI. However, the data contradicts this line of thinking. History teaches us that major technological shifts play out over years, not months (the internet revolution is still playing out, for example). Analysts agree. Over the next six years, the global AI market is set to grow from $184 billion to $826 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nObscure AI Stocks Set to Soar\n\nBecause building a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT is so capital intensive, mainly large-cap cash-rich stocks like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have benefitted thus far. However, recently, a few smaller, more obscure AI names have appeared on my radar. Because these stocks are unknown and have a very small market cap, their potential is much higher than that of the well-known names.\n\nBelow are my top 3 obscure AI names to watch:\n\nCXApp\n\nCXApp (CXAI) is an AI-powered software company that empowers businesses to manage their workplaces more effectively. The CXApp allows employees to book office space, communicate with colleagues, manage events, and organize the office culture.\n\nCXAI Inks Deal with Google Cloud\n\nLast night, CXAI announced a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to move towards an “AI-native SaaS model.” The news is important for two reasons:\n\n1.       Google is a leader in the cloud space.\n\n2.       CXAI has a float of just 7.9 million shares.\n\nThough the stock is up more than 100% today, a landmark deal coupled with a tiny float is a recipe for a longer-term move.\n\nAudioEye\n\nAudioEye (AEYE) is an AI player that has found its niche, helping companies serve people with disabilities. AEYE’s AI technology makes websites reachable to people with disabilities, including those with vision impairments or other challenges.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia Deal\n\nAEYE recently inked a deal with AI leader Nvidia for its LiDAR technology for autonomous vehicles. Unlike most small AI names, AEYE has performed well over the past year and is up a robust 363%. Furthermore, AEYE is already profitable and the stock is finding buyers off the 10-week moving average – a bullish sign. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nSoundHound AI\n\nSpeaking of Nvidia, SoundHound AI (SOUN) garnered attention after Nvidia disclosed a stake in the company. SoundHound leverages AI to help devices understand and respond to both music and voice commands.\n\nSoundHound’s Strategic Partnership with Perplexity\n\nSoundHound recently inked a deal with LLM leader Perplexity. Perplexity is one of the fastest-growing LLMs and already has a valuation of more than $3 billion (Perplexity launched in 2022). SOUN’s strategic partnerships are already bearing fruit. Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest revenue will grow at a scorching 70% or more clip into 2025. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI revolution is still in the early innings. Three obscure, AI-related companies have multi-bag potential in the coming years.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Rocketing Higher Today",
        "content": "Why Is Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US producer price index (PPI - prices that businesses charge for their goods and services) in July 2024 increased 2.2% year on year, falling compared to the 2.7% y/y growth recorded in the previous month. The report also revealed a month-on-month growth of 0.1%, below analysts' estimates of 0.2%. In addition, Core PPI (prices excluding food and energy) were flat month on month. PPI is often considered a leading indicator of CPI since what businesses pay tends to be passed through to consumers. Overall, the data confirmed that inflation is cooling off. This is a favorable data point supporting an interest rate cut by the Fed. Notably, markets expect the first rate cut to be announced during the September 2024 policy meeting.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 21 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today’s move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company dropped 14.8% as markets continued to decline, although they have recovered a bit since the open (Nasdaq down 3.6%, S&P 500 down 3%). Yields also retreated as worries about a US recession grew. The declines followed volatility on Friday, August 2, when the July Non-Farm Payrolls data revealed weaker job growth as the unemployment rate rose. Markets might also be concerned that the Fed is behind in cutting rates, with the Federal Open Market Committee leaving rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% during the July 2024 meeting. For example, respected economist and University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel took an aggressive stance, calling on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate after Friday’s disappointing jobs report.\n\nNvidia is up 138% since the beginning of the year, but at $114.70 per share it is still trading 15.4% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $29,424.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Nvidia (NVDA) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 59.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 107.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -35.6%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Nvidia is 303.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -14.3%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 50.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 2.2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNvidia has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Nvidia well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are a Buy After the Recent Sell-Off",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were on a roll for a while, but they have run into some skeptical market makers lately. As a result, some top-notch AI experts are on fire sale right now, and I expect them to come back strong in the long run.\n\nRead on to see why semiconductor company Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and voice-recognition expert SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) look like no-brainer buys right now.\n\nIntel's several key roles in AI\n\nYou would think Intel would be a market darling right now, but it's not.\n\nIts Xeon processors play a vital role in managing the data flows into AI accelerator chips, so there are lots of Xeons in many AI-training supercomputers. Intel also offers its own AI accelerator chips with bang-for-your-buck performance comparable to the best from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, the company manufactures AI chips for other companies, including longtime computing partner Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nSo Intel has its finger on the AI pulse from several different angles. Yet, the stock has been swooning instead of soaring in the AI boom. While Nvidia's stock more than quintupled over the last three years and the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index gained 26%, Intel investors were stuck with a decline of 60%. INTC Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe bearish pressure on Intel's stock is getting lighter, however. The company fell short of Wall Street's consensus targets in the recent second-quarter report but announced ambitious cost-cutting and timely progress in the next leading-edge manufacturing node, code-named Intel 18A.\n\nIntel's stock was already affordable before this report but still fell another 26% the next day. The company is going through an unprofitable period of expensive investment in manufacturing equipment, setting it up for fantastic business results in the long run. With $120 billion of stockholder equity (also known as book value), the stock trades at a price-to-book ratio of 0.69.\n\nThat's an all-time low and a valuation usually reserved for companies on the brink of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Intel has plenty of growth catalysts in play, often related to the AI revolution. Thanks to this imbalance between robust business prospects and falling market value, I see a great buying opportunity in Intel's current price dip.\n\nSoundHound AI's mass-market transition\n\nSoundHound AI is an early-stage growth story, not a turnaround effort. The company is only getting started on a moneymaking business plan after running a popular but not very profitable song-identification service for nearly two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock soared earlier this year as investors caught wind of Nvidia buying $3.7 million of SoundHound AI stock, but the elevated price didn't last. Shares have traded sideways for three months, following a steep price drop in March and April.\n\nSo the stock looks sleepy, but there's nothing boring about the underlying business story. Last week's second-quarter report edged out analysts' average expectations across the board. After the buyout of conversational AI specialist Amelia, SoundHound AI raised its full-year revenue guidance from roughly $71 million to at least $80 million, followed by a jump to over $150 million in 2025.\n\nThe company is starting to convert its enormous order backlog into cash-based sales. If that's not exciting enough, it keeps adding household names to its customer list.

        "title": "Should You Buy the 3 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks Since the Market Selloff?",
        "content": "The stock market plummeted last week on fears of a recession. The S&P 500 tumbled more than 3% as investors fled former high-flying stocks. While the benchmark index did claw back all the losses to essentially breakeven by the end of the week, such wild swings could be a sign of a new, more sustained collapse.\n\nThe best S&P 500 stocks during the recent market turmoil were not the same ones that brought the index to its all-time highs. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is still down 2.5% from last week, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is flat and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) is off nearly 2%.\n\nInstead, there were three companies that barely flinched at the tumult and then went on to score steep gains. If the market is getting ready to fall again, is now the time to buy the best S&P 500 stocks since the selloff?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s dive in to see why these three stocks should be on your radar.\n\nKellanova (K) Hand holding a chart of hot stocks that are going up in value\n\nSource: Shutter_M / Shutterstock\n\nSnacks maker Kellanova (NYSE:K) couldn’t have cared less about the stock market’s drop. When everyone else was losing their mind, the owner of Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Eggo waffles was rocketing 16% higher that day.\n\nWhile Kellanova reported better than expected earnings the week prior, showing better than expected top and bottom line numbers, it was news of a potential buyout that sent shares soaring. Privately held candy maker Mars was rumored to be considering acquiring Kellanova. The snacks market is quickly becoming a hotbed of mergers-and-acquisition activity.\n\nMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) bought Clif Bar for $2.9 billion, Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) bought peanut stock Planters for $3.4 billion, J&J Snack Foods (NASDAQ:JJSF) bought Dippin’ Dots for $222 million, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) bought Rao’s pasta sauce maker Sovos Brands for $2.3 billion and J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) acquired Hostess Brands for $5.6 billion.\n\nThat’s a lot of deals in the space. And let’s not forget that Kellanova itself spun off its cereal business into WK Kellogg (NYSE:KLG) so it could focus on snacks.\n\nIt is important to remember there is no deal for Kellanova announced. It is rumor based on unnamed sources, according to Reuters. But with Kellanova having a $27 billion market valuation prior to the potential deal being disclosed, it would make an acquisition one of the biggest in the industry.\n\nKellanova reported strong organic growth and raised its outlook for the year. With snacks a fast-growing market, Kellanova would make a good stock to own regardless. K stock is up almost 19% since the market selloff.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (FTNT) Fortinet company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. FTNT stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity outfit Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) hesitated on the market selloff. Shares dipped 2% on the news but then it reported second-quarter earnings on August 6 and was off to the races. Shares soared 15% on the beat-and-raise results and closed out the week 23% higher.\n\nMuch of its business is centered around hardware-based firewalls monitoring traffic for physical data centers. Because its solutions offered intrusion prevention systems, endpoint security and secure access service edge (SASE) offerings, billing volumes are soaring.\n\nRevenue jumped 11% year-over-year leading to record GAAP and adjusted operating margins north of 30% and 35%, respectively. FTNT stock is up 19% year-to-date and has climbed 58% from its 52-week low. It doesn’t hurt either that industry leader CrowdstrikeHoldings (NASDAQ:CRWD) suffered a major snafu that should bolster sales for its rivals.\n\nWall Street forecasts revenue will grow 10% this year to almost $5.9 billion and then grow another 12% in 2025 hitting $6.6 billion. Earnings over the next two years are expected to do even better. Analysts estimate $2.21 in earnings in 2025, a 36% jump from last year’s figure.\n\nFortinet continues to be one of the best S&P stocks to buy.\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American weapon manufacturer Axon Enterprise Inc. on screen in front of webpage. Focus on cellphone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStun gun maker Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is another stock that shrugged off the market selloff. Its shares dipped 2% last Monday but it also reported earnings that wiped all vestiges of doubt from investors’ minds. Shares rocketed 25% higher the next day as revenue raced 35% higher in the second quarter. It allowed the maker of less-than-lethal weapons, cameras and evidence database management software to raise its outlook for the year.\n\nDemand for Axon’s Taser energy weapons, commonly referred to as stun guns, continue to grow. Sales were up 27% in the period to $196 million with gross margins exceeding 60%. Its body cameras also saw significant uptake by law enforcement with the sensors segment revenue jumping 28% year-over-year. Axon noted its newest model, the Axon Body 4, was the model that saw the fastest adoption. It has already sold over 200,000 units.\n\nIn an era of accountability that seeks protection of both law enforcement officers and the public, less-than-lethal weapons and body cam usage is exploding. Analysts forecast sales will jump 29% for the full-year to $2 billion with profits rising 15% to $4.78 per share. Axon Enterprise is still one of the best S&P 500 stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Invest in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.20 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 40 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in NVDA?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $2.69.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks",
        "content": "The tech industry has made many millionaires, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector up 362% since 2014. The index has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index, which rose 179% in the same period. Advances in technology consistently push the market forward, with regular breakthroughs requiring consumers and businesses to update their hardware and software.\n\nAs a result, it's no surprise that four of the five most valuable companies in the world are tech leaders, active in industries such as consumer products, productivity software, chip design, and digital advertising. Burgeoning sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing are currently some of the industry's biggest growth drivers, making their respective market leaders attractive investments.\n\nSo, here are two millionaire-maker technology stocks to buy this August before it's too late.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAfter more than a year of soaring share prices and glowing quarterly earnings, it's probably not surprising that Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is on this list. The company's stock is up 132% since last August. Meanwhile, quarterly operating income and free cash flow have climbed 112% and 62%, expanding its cash reserves.\n\nA tech sell-off over the last month brought on by fears of a recession has seen Nvidia's stock fall 16%. However, consistent earnings growth and a dominant role in tech means the dip only strengthens a bullish argument for its stock, creating an opportunity to invest at a reduced price.\n\nIn the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, Nvidia posted revenue gains of 262% year over year while operating income soared 492%. The company benefited from significant growth in its data center segment, reflecting a boost in AI graphics processing unit (GPU) sales. Total revenue for the quarter outperformed Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\n\nStellar earnings have become a trend for Nvidia, beating expectations for at least the last four quarters. The company will post its Q2 2025 results on Aug. 28 and will likely follow the recent growth trajectory after glowing results from its chip rival, Advanced Micro Devices, last month. AMD has the second-largest market share in AI chips after Nvidia and delivered a record 115% year-over-year rise in revenue in its data center segment in Q2 2024.\n\nAMD's win proves AI still has much to offer tech companies. And as a leader in the industry with an estimated 80% market share in AI GPUs, Nvidia is a millionaire-maker stock worth buying right now.\n\nNvidia's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is high at 62, yet well below its five-year average of 80. The company's stock rose more than 2,000% with that average, making it a value compared to Nvidia's potential.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered impressive gains over the years, with its stock up nearly 1,000% since 2014. Monster success in e-commerce and cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS) has seen its operating income and free cash flow skyrocket by 20,000% and 2,000%, respectively, in that time.  In fact, the company's free cash flow hit more than $48 billion this year, with some analysts speculating that it could be gearing up to release its first dividend.\n\nThanks to its thoroughly diverse business model, the retail giant has become one of the best ways to invest in tech. Consistent reinvestment over the years has seen Amazon diversify its revenue streams and extend its reach with solid positions in online retail, AI, grocery, video streaming, digital advertising, and more.\n\nAmazon's Q2 2024 earnings reflected its diversified business. Revenue increased by 10% year over year after mediocre growth in its retail business. However, total operating income more than doubled from the previous year to $14.6 billion after considerable gains from AWS.\n\nThe company enjoyed impressive gains in its digital businesses during the quarter, with AWS sales climbing 19% year over year and revenue from advertising services increasing by 20%. Amazon's role in tech is swiftly expanding and has become a larger part of its business over the years, exposing the company to markets with attractive profit margins. AWS has granted the company a powerful position in AI. Meanwhile, its streaming service Prime Video gives it a powerful advertising tool and a new growth catalyst.\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon's P/E of 40 is considerably lower than its five-year average of 89. The company has made many millionaires in the past but likely isn't done yet, with its stock a compelling option this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Market Volatility Continues: 4 Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "Last week, Wall Street witnessed one of the most eventful weeks in 2024. Markets were rattled on Aug 5, following the release of disappointing July payrolls data, reigniting fears that the economy might slip into a recession.\n\nHowever, stocks have recovered most of the losses since then in a dramatic rebound that has greatly fizzled fears of a recession in the near term, following the release of a fresh jobless claims report that came in better than expected.  However, the market volatility is far from over.\n\nOn Aug 5, the Dow gave up more than 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 finished 3% lower to record its worst day since 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 3.4%. The massive selloff was sparked by fears that the Fed may have held interest rates higher for too long, which has started taking its toll on the economy.\n\nTech stocks, which were so long driving the market rally, were the worst suffers of last week’s market rout, with $1.5 billion of market capitalization being wiped out of the “magnificent 7” stocks.\n\nHowever, markets have since made a solid rebound. On Aug 8, all three major indexes rallied, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq jumping 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The S&P recorded its best close since November 2022.\n\nOnce again, the rally was driven by tech stocks. Markets closed the week on a high, recovering nearly all the earlier losses. However, the volatility is far from over as the Federal Reserve said that it will closely monitor inflation data before going ahead with the rate cuts.\n\nInflation has declined sharply over the past couple of months and investors are now awaiting the key consumer price index (CPI) reading for July.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is gearing up for its rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 25-50 basis point rate cut in September, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\n\nLower interest rates typically help growth stocks, particularly tech stocks. Given this situation, it would be a wise decision to buy stocks at a bargain.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have chosen four top-ranked tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, NetApp, Inc. NTAP and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world’s largest social media platform. META’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms’ expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42.8%.

        "content": "Finding underrated Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy in 2024 will not be a walk in the park. Although the index recently experienced a small dip, many of the companies are still extremely expensive.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 is an index comprising 100 of the top non-financial securities trading on the Nasdaq exchange. This means that only securities listed on the Nasdaq exchange are included in the index. Additionally, it includes companies from sectors such as consumer staples, materials, industrials, and information technology.\n\nWhile the index comprises household names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), they are certainly far from “underrated.” For investors eyeing the end of the decade, these three standout companies have the potential to deliver significant returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s unpack the top three underrated Nasdaq 100 stocks to turn $10,000 into $50,000 by 2029.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is the first company among the top underrated Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy in 2024. As a leader in human capital management (HCM) services, ADP’s steady revenue, earnings, and free cash flow growth make it a great long-term investment.\n\nWhen it comes to Automatic Data Processing, there is not much negative that you can say about the company. While it is not as exciting as other technology companies on the Nasdaq, its essential service offerings are integral to all businesses. The company’s cloud-based platform seamlessly integrates payroll and HR solutions to more than 1 million customers across the globe. Additionally, ADP has embraced the AI revolution with the world’s largest AI-powered HCM dataset, ADP Assist.\n\nAfter reporting record earnings results in fiscal year (FY) 2023, the company maintained its strong momentum. In FY 2024, revenue increased 7% year over year to $19.2 billion. Net earnings rose 10% to $3.8 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin up 70 basis points to 25.5%. Management forecasts adjusted earnings per share growth in the 8% to 10% range in 2025, building on its streak of profitable growth.\n\nRoss Stores (ROST) Retail Stocks to Buy for the Long Run: Ross Stores (ROST)\n\nSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoss Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), is a retail business that continues to thrive in 2024. The company provides a wide array of heavily discounted items across the home goods, apparel, and footwear industries.\n\nRoss Stores is an extremely high-quality retail business to keep a close eye on this year. Its off-price chain of retail outlets has proven to be extremely profitable and has done exceptionally well in various economic climates. The company’s strong brand recognition and focus on low-cost, high-quality items has afforded it a loyal customer base over the last few decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nSurprisingly, the business has been going strong even despite its lack of e-commerce presence. In its Q1 FY24, revenue increased 8% year over year to $4.9 billion. Net earnings swelled 31% year over year to $488 million, with comparable sales up 3% from the year prior. Additionally, operating margin expanded by 205 basis points to 12.2%. With stronger liquidity coming into 2024, Ross is well-positioned to drive comparable sales and earnings growth through 2029.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON)\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is an American semiconductor company that provides a wide range of chips and sensors for the electric vehicle (EV), energy storage, and industrial markets. The company’s recent blockbuster investments in silicon carbide (SiC) modules provide it with ample room for growth over the next decade.\n\nON Semiconductor is the backbone of industries that are set to expand rapidly over the next several decades. As governments and corporations continue to invest billions of dollars into the clean energy transition, demand for ON Semiconductor’s products will rise. In 2024, the market is seemingly bearish on the entire clean energy sector except for a few names. The EV sector is bearish with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) forecasting a decline in vehicle deliveries and gross margins. However, this negative sentiment is not affecting ON Semiconductor’s planned investments in 2024.\n\nIt recently announced the acquisition of image-sensing company SWIR Vision Systems and continues to expand its SiC manufacturing capacity. For investors searching for the best underrated Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy, ON stock should certainly be one of the top considerations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: August 2024",
        "content": "Before considering which semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip, it’s important to understand why chip stocks have been falling since the beginning of July. Consider three intertwined reasons.\n\nFirst, recession concerns are back. The latest job numbers show a tightening labor market, and the July reading on inflation is due the week of August 12. Global markets are starting to believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t be able to cut interest rates quickly enough to prevent a recession.\n\nGeopolitical concerns are also bedeviling investors. The outcome of this November’s election is likely to have significant ramifications in the ways the U.S. relates to China and/or Taiwan. That could put additional pressure on inventory levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis means investors are starting to sell some winners either to build up cash or to rotate into other stocks. Because of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, chip stocks have been some of the biggest winners in 2024.\n\nBut when does a sell-off become overdone? Every investor must answer that for themselves. But for a variety of reasons, the following three companies look like attractive semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 111% in 2024. It’s also down 22% in the 30 days ending August 9, 2024. That the first statement is true, doesn’t make the second statement less true. Shares of NVIDIA have pulled back substantially, but is that reason to buy semiconductor stocks on the dip?\n\nThose in the No camp would point out that NVIDIA has announced a delay in chip production. It also may be discontinuing its popular and inexpensive GeForce RTX 3060 chip. The belief is that any production delay opens the door for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) that are eager to capture market share. Many companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are actively looking for alternatives to NVIDIA chips.\n\nBut that presumes that the competition is ready with chips to take that share. It also speculates the economy remaining strong enough so that what corporations have noted as intention to spend on AI infrastructure matches what they actually spend.\n\nWhile that may affect NVIDIA as much as other companies, the company and NVDA stock are well positioned to overcome any short-term impacts.\n\nARM Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe one-year anniversary of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) going public is approaching. And it’s been quite a year. Shares are up 55% since the initial public offering (IPO) but are down more than 32% in the last month. A solid first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings report may have put a floor on the sell-off. But it’s not lifting ARM stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo understand what could be driving this, it’s important to comprehend ARM’s role in chip manufacturing. Specifically, the company doesn’t make or produce its own chips. Rather, it’s a designer for chips and software which collects licensing fees and royalties on its architectures and intellectual properties (IPs).\n\nIn the company’s recent earnings report, it offered cautious guidance. That is, it maintained its current guidance. As noted in the introduction, that’s not what investors want to hear right now, particularly if they’re going to pay a premium for chip stocks. This could be the reason for short interest in ARM stock is up in the last 30 days.\n\nOn the other hand, about 99% of premium smartphones are powered by ARM CPUs. That should put a floor on the company’s fundamentals which makes this a buyable dip.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there’s such a thing as an undervalued chip stock in 2024, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) may be it. AMAT stock is up only 37% in the last 12 months, which seems downright undervalued compared to other chip stocks. However, the stock is down more than 20% in the last month. That may signal one of the best opportunities for semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nLike ARM, Applied Materials doesn’t make chips, but it provides chipmakers with innovative materials and engineering solutions. In May 2023, Applied Materials announced its intention to build its Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) center. The company touts this as “the world’s largest and most advanced facility for collaborative semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment research and development (R&D).”\n\nThe project won’t be ready until 2026. However, the company reports earnings in mid-August. A strong report should be just what the company needs to move it higher, particularly since AMAT stock appears to have found support around $193.09 at market close on August 12, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "ASML Stock Is Down 20%. Here’s Why You Should Buy ASML Holdings Now.",
        "content": "Netherlands-based ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) was one of the best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq 100 exchange in the first quarter of 2024. As artificial intelligence mania gripped the market and chip companies invested billions into the technology, ASML soared, rising 33% over the first three months of the year.\n\nThat’s because the semiconductor equipment manufacturer has a virtual monopoly on the manufacturing of the critical equipment chipmakers need to make AI chips. Its extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines are needed by the semiconductor industry for making pristine wafers.\n\nYet, the stock tumbled hard last month and is down 21% from its highs. The reason is nearly half of its revenue comes from China. With the Biden administration proposing harsh restrictions on sales of computer equipment to China, its business is most at risk of being severely damaged. Although it is domiciled in the Netherlands, if it wants to also sell its equipment to U.S. chip manufacturers, it will have to give up the China trade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs difficult of a position as it places ASML Holdings stock, it also makes it the perfect time to buy shares.\n\nGlobal Demand Is Surging Silicon Dies are being Extracted by a Pick and Place Machine from Wafer and Attached to Substrate. Computer Chip Manufacturing at Factory. Close-up of Semiconductor Packaging Process. Chip stocks\n\nSource: IM Imagery / Shutterstock.com\n\nASML is a picks-and-shovels play on artificial intelligence. It sells the tools to all the miners heading off to pan for AI gold. It doesn’t matter to it who wins as it is willing to sell to anyone who needs its equipment. Being an agnostic semi-stock is why ASML is a great investment.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, there would be no issues but because of heightened geopolitical concerns, ASML is at risk.\n\nThe computer equipment manufacturer’s total revenue rose 18% in the second quarter to 6.2 billion euros compared to a year ago. It achieved gross margins of 51.5%, better than what it reported for all of 2023.\n\nBecause ASML forecasts demand growing through 2025, this year is the first time it is pre-building its inventory in anticipation of the order flow. Meeting demand has been a problem in the past but hasn’t been a concern so far in 2024.\n\nIts biggest market, though, is China. Sales to the country jumped 21% to 2.3 billion euros. While CFO Roger Dassen maintains ASML doesn’t look at country-specific markets to determine demand but rather looks at what global chip demand may be, it doesn’t model specifically for the country.\n\nYet with the Biden administration attempting to keep advanced semiconductor chips and equipment out of Beijing’s hands, it represents a potential sucking wound to ASML’s business.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Narrow Escape a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFortunately, ASML was just given a pass. The Biden administration is keeping the export controls on countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Israel. Equipment manufacturers in Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, however, would be exempt.\n\nThe restrictions bar about half a dozen Chinese semiconductor factories from receiving the vital equipment, Reuters reports. But not from the exempt countries, so it ultimately limits the effectiveness of the ban.\n\nThe administration maintains the exemptions are temporary though it doesn’t say when it will revisit them. ASML Holdings has gotten a reprieve but for how long remains to be seen.\n\nYet, it also means ASML stock should be high on your buy list.\n\nGiven Free Rein to Grow AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile ASML does have a monopoly on certain equipment, not all of what it produces doesn’t face competition. Yet since the Biden administration is hamstringing U.S. equipment manufacturers, it leaves the door open for ASML and a handful of other companies to steal customers away from its rivals. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, will be prevented from selling its AI chips to China.\n\nHaving free rein in the fast-growing Chinese semiconductor market should see ASML’s exports there surging in the quarters ahead. They were already on the rise but now they just might have had a match lit under their growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, in line with U.S. sanctions, H20's computing power had been significantly capped compared to the H100 chips.\n\nThe Journal report said Huawei aims to start shipping its newest chip as soon as October.\n\nCompanies such as TikTok parent ByteDance, Baidu and China Mobile are looking to obtain the 910C chips.\n\nInitial negotiations between Huawei and potential customers indicate that orders are likely to surpass 70,000 chips, with a total value of around $2 billion, according to the report.\n\n(Reporting by Devika Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)",

Some of these stocks present long-term opportunities for patient investors while others stocks will continue to dip. Seeing what analysts say about publicly-traded corporations can provide some clues about the future direction of those stocks.\n\nAnalysts regularly adjust their price targets after earnings and in light of news developments. These individuals and their firms regularly stay on top of individual stocks, sectors and the broader economy. Analysts have more time and expertise in stock investing than the average investor, which is what makes it good to consider what they say.\n\nGranted, you should conduct some of your own due diligence instead of solely relying on an analyst’s insights.

MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has outpaced the stock market for several years. The company’s stock is up by 9% year-to-date and has almost tripled over the past five years. A recent stock correction has raised the yield to 0.74% while resulting in a 34.5x P/E ratio.\n\nThe tech giant is a top beneficiary of the AI boom on the software side. Copilot allows Microsoft to tap into more verticals and expand its presence. For instance, Copilot for Security expanded the company’s market share in the cybersecurity industry. Microsoft’s Q4 FY24 revenue and net income growth rates decelerated a bit but still came in at healthy levels. Revenue increased by 15% YoY to reach $53.7 billion while net income was up by 10% YoY.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud continues to be a critical component of the company’s long-term plans. Cloud revenue increased by 21% YoY to reach a record $36.8 billion. The conglomerate also reported impressive growth rates in other business segments, such as Productivity and Business Processes.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) makes almost all of its revenue from online advertisements. The company is diversifying into other revenue streams like augmented reality and AI. While those opportunities can eventually pan out in meaningful ways, the company’s underlying business model continues to excel.\n\nFacebook’s parent company reported 22% YoY revenue growth and 73% YoY net income growth in the second quarter. The company has 3.27 billion daily active users across its social networks which is a 7% YoY increase. As more people flock to Meta’s family of apps, advertisers get more opportunities to showcase their businesses. That also means more revenue for Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadcount remained stable, only down by 1% YoY. It’s a notable achievement, given the company’s ability to still generate 73% YoY revenue growth. Meta has become more efficient, and it’s been able to give out quarterly dividends to its investors. The tech giant also invests billions of dollars into stock buybacks each quarter, further raising the stock price.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) offers a good blend of value and growth. The stock trades at an 18x P/E ratio and offers a 1.18% yield. Shares are up by 26% year-to-date and have gained 89% over the past five years. The fintech firm benefits from rising revenue and profit margins as younger consumers create new cards with the company.\n\nRevenue increased by 9% YoY in the second quarter while net income jumped by 39% YoY. Revenue has been in the high single-digits or low double-digits for several quarters, and net income has often outpaced it. American Express closed out the quarter with a 20% net profit margin. Guidance suggests that profit margins will continue to expand.\n\nConsumers will use their credit and debit cards in any economy. These cards are more convenient and secure than paper cash, and many of them also have enticing reward programs. American Express is a leading credit and debit card issuer that offers a reasonable valuation and promising growth prospects.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe AI chipmaker stands to benefit from a potential partnership with OpenAI that can boost its sales. However, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) isn’t relying on OpenAI to succeed in the booming artificial intelligence industry. The company generated a record $3.1 billion from its AI products in Q2 FY24 in an effort that resulted in 43% YOY revenue growth across the company. The VMware acquisition has been a boon for Broadcom’s infrastructure software solutions.\n\nThe stock has been a consistent outperformer before artificial intelligence become mainstream. Shares are up by 37% year-to-date and have more than quintupled over the past five years. Broadcom also offers a 1.42% yield and has maintained an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nA recent 10-for-1 stock split brought more attention to Broadcom, but shares are now in a correction. This opportunity looks promising for long-term investors are Broadcom gets closer to a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom isn’t the only corporation that initiated a stock split. In fact, it seems like stock splits are making a comeback, with Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) leading the way. The fast food restaurant chain announced a 50-for-1 stock split earlier in the year. The split brought more attention to the stock, but shares are currently in the middle of a correction.\n\nMany fast food restaurants and consumer discretionary companies have faced pushback from higher prices. However, Chipotle defied industry headwinds by reporting 18.2% YoY revenue growth in the second quarter. Even better, the Mexican Grill chain reported 33% YoY net income growth, resulting in a 15.3% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle has been no stranger to price hikes, but it is a healthier alternative to many fast food restaurants. The company’s reputation for offering quality food relative to its competitors has given it more pricing power. That should please investors, on top of the stock’s 240% gain over the past five years.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has a sprawling presence that includes more than 10,500 stores and clubs in 19 countries. The company has almost half of its stores located in the U.S. and has 2.1 million employees. Walmart stock has outpaced the stock market with a 28% year-to-date gain. Furthermore, shares are up by 90% over the past five years and offer a 1.22% yield. The stock trades at a 29x P/E ratio.\n\nThe company’s Q1 FY25 results suggest that the gains should continue. Consolidated revenue increased by 6.0% YoY to reach $61.5 billion. Meanwhile, net income more than tripled YoY to reach $5.1 billion, resulting in a 3.16% net profit margin.\n\nE-commerce sales growth was a major highlight, delivering a 21% YoY increase in sales. Walmart’s advertising segment also did well, generating 24% more revenue than the same quarter last year. Ads only make up a small percentage of Walmart’s total revenue, but this segment can improve the company’s profit margins.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the AI leader for several years and made it on every investor’s radar in 2023. It’s hard to ignore a stock that has more than doubled year-to-date that has logged a 2,621% gain over the past five years. However, investors still believe that Nvidia can continue to rally. It was briefly the world’s most valuable company and may reclaim that title within a few years.\n\nThe AI chipmaker’s revenue and net income continue to surge at levels that other mega-caps can’t compete with. Sales increased by 262% YoY to reach $26 billion, while net income surged by 628% YOY. Nvidia’s profit margins have accelerated dramatically over the past year and came in at 57.1% in Q1 FY25.\n\nThe artificial intelligence is projected to maintain a compounded annualized growth rate of 36.6% from now until 2030. There’s already speculation that Nvidia’s next earnings report will be a smash hit that acts as the next big AI catalyst. Investors are excited about Nvidia stock, and the corporation has earned the enthusiasm of its analysts. Nvidia can soar to all-time highs if it reports good results for Q2 FY25.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, AVGO, and NVDA.

        "title": "INTC Stock Prediction: Can Intel Survive?",
        "content": "As a tech reporter going back over 40 years, it’s incredible to be writing this.\n\nBut can Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) survive?\n\nWhat was once the world’s dominant semiconductor power is a shell of its former self. It’s all there in the second quarter earnings report, which led it to lose 43% of its value in just one month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe loss of $1.6 billion, 38 cents per share, is just the headline. Now nearly 20,000 employees are heading for the exits. The dividend has also been suspended. Shareholders are suing, claiming they weren’t told how bad the trouble was.\n\nThe Trouble Is Bad\n\nPat Gelsinger returned to the company where he’d first made his career as CEO in 2021, determined to remake Intel as a first-class chip foundry, not just a design house.\n\nIt’s not working. The Foundry isn’t cost-competitive with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Yields are bad. Chips that were due to arrive in 2025 may not arrive until 2027.\n\nThe design house is worse. PC processor chips are failing. Its Gaudi Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), meant to compete with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), doesn’t. That chip isn’t even made by Intel but by TSMC.\n\nMy saying “I told you so” over 20 years doesn’t help anything. Intel blew its opportunities in phone chips, modems and memory under a succession of marketing and finance leaders. Gelsinger was chief technology officer (CTO) before his 2009 departure to VMware, but 12 years is a lifetime in tech terms.\n\nGelsinger’s foundry failures have a political dimension. Intel got $8.5 billion in U.S. government money for building its new foundries in Arizona and Ohio. There is also an Investment Tax Credit of up to 25% on its $100 billion of investment, and it’s eligible for $11 billion in government loans. The failures of Intel Foundry are on us and could kill the whole U.S. move into manufacturing if Republicans resume control of Washington.\n\nHelp!\n\nNvidia is just one of the companies desperate for Intel to succeed. It can’t get all the supplies it needs from TSMC. Intel is now in a race with Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), which already supplies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to deliver them.\n\nIntel’s efforts are kept afloat by borrowing. Long-term debt was over $48 billion at the end of June. There’s also $4.7 billion in short-term debt. Intel had nearly $15 billion in new financing during the second quarter while putting $11.6 billion into capital spending. The Intel Foundry lost $2.8 billion during the quarter. Intel has also tapped private equity, which owns almost half the profits from new foundries.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you think Nvidia or a Cloud leader like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might be sniffing for a bargain, forget it. The “enterprise value” of Intel includes its debt. The price of buying this mess isn’t $84 billion. It probably starts at $150 billion. Then you will have to run it and take losses already built in.\n\nThe problem is what I call “Moore’s Second Law.” It’s true that chip densities, speeds and thus cost-efficiency double as circuit lines grow closer. But the cost of setting up production also doubles along with this efficiency. The industry is losing the ability to produce what it can design. Maybe that’s the real end of Moore’s Law.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvestors sitting on losses may be tempted to throw in more cash. At a minimum, you will reduce your cost basis in the stock.\n\nBut there are no guarantees. Even with $10 billion in cost cuts, Gelsinger isn’t promising profits before 2026. Even if Intel does show a profit, the AI ramp-up may be over before it gets into gear.\n\nIntel is too essential to fail. What Gelsinger calls Intel’s “death march” is taking longer than anyone anticipated, and the U.S. needs it to get the foundry right.\n\nYou’re paying for this with your tax dollars. But you may want to think twice before adding new investment dollars to the pot.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a LONG position in INTC, TSM, AAPL, and MSFT.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Sell-Off: Is It Time to Buy This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stalwart?",
        "content": "Amidst a market sell-off centered around big tech stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a rough month. Since it hit $135 per share in early July, the stock has sold off heavily and now sits at just shy of $100 per share. That's a near-30% decline from its high, indicating that Nvidia stock is in its own bear market.\n\nWhile this may cause some investors to panic, it may provide other investors a chance to buy the stock at a discount after missing the initial rise. So, is Nvidia stock a buy here? Or is this a reasonable price correction?\n\nTwo long-term non-factors are influencing Nvidia's stock\n\nThe broader stock market sell-off is loosely attributed to a trading strategy that caused investors to borrow the Japanese Yen at low interest rates and then use that money to invest in some of the most dominant tech stocks in the U.S. market (like Nvidia). Now that Japan has signaled it is tightening interest rates, anyone doing this is selling their shares to return the money before higher interest rates kick in.\n\nAdditionally, there is some fear that the U.S. Federal Reserve is asleep at the wheel and that it should be cutting interest rates. With unemployment rising steadily, many are concerned that we're actually in the beginning phases of a recession.\n\nThese prevailing headwinds aren't doing Nvidia investors any favors, but they allow long-term investors to add more at a great price. These factors won't stop artificial intelligence (AI) proliferation, so it doesn't make sense to factor them into the long-term investment thesis.\n\nBecause Nvidia is the top supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computing power necessary to train AI models, it has benefited greatly over the past year and a half as the AI arms race heats up. This isn't projected to slow anytime soon, and investors should focus on the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nHowever, is the sell-off deep enough to warrant buying Nvidia stock?\n\nNvidia's stock is now in the buy zone\n\nValuing Nvidia stock is incredibly difficult because of its rapid growth and transformation. The best way to value it is by using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) method, which uses analyst earnings projections over the next 12 months to assess the stock. While this method isn't perfect, it's the best way to assess Nvidia.\n\nThanks to the sell-off, Nvidia trades for an expensive but much more reasonable 36 times forward earnings. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile this only resets the valuation to late May levels (before its first-quarter earnings report), it's still not a bad price. Since its big tech peers like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft aren't that much cheaper than Nvidia, trading respectively for 35, 31, and 30 times forward earnings. Plus, they don't have nearly the growth potential, it's starting to look like Nvidia may be worth buying.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you're going to buy Nvidia stock, it's probably best to do it before Aug. 28. That's when Nvidia reports Q2 earnings for its fiscal 2025, and Nvidia's stock has popped after almost every earnings report dating back to Q1 FY 2024. I'd be surprised if anything Nvidia says in that earnings report sends the stock lower, as all of the language from the cloud computing providers and any other company investing heavily in AI servers has stated they will only spend more over the next year.\n\nThis is great news for Nvidia and is a fantastic reason to buy the stock now amid the market sell-off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock After Its 600% Surge? Wall Street Has a Clear Answer.",
        "content": "Many experts see artificial intelligence (AI) as the investment opportunity of a lifetime. While the market is still nascent, chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has already benefited substantially. Since January 2023, its trailing-12-month revenue has nearly tripled and shares have surged more than 600%.\n\nAfter those astonishing gains, some investors may worry it's too late to buy Nvidia stock, but Wall Street remains bullish. Sixty-one analysts follow the semiconductor company, according to CNN Business. Within that group, 92% (56 analysts) rate the stock a buy, and the remaining 8% (5 analysts) rate the stock a hold. Not a single analyst recommends selling right now.\n\nEven more compelling, Nvidia carries a median 12-month price target of $140 per share, which implies 35% upside from its current share price of $104. Suffice it to say Wall Street analysts generally do not believe it's too late to buy Nvidia. In fact, most view the current price as a reasonable entry point for investors.\n\nNvidia dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Analysts estimate its market share in AI processors between 70% and 95%, and Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nFew companies achieve that level of dominance, but Nvidia managed to threat that needle for three reasons. First, its GPUs are the fastest data center accelerators on the market. Second, it offers a robust ecosystem of supporting software tools that make its GPUs the go-to option for developers of accelerated computing applications. Third, Nvidia provides adjacent hardware to supplement its GPUs, such that the company effectively builds entire AI data centers.\n\nNvidia has a durable competitive advantage that spans hardware and software\n\nNvidia consistently crushes the competition at the MLPerf benchmarks, tests that provide an unbiased evaluation of AI training and inference capabilities across hardware, software, and services. In March, Nvidia Hopper GPUs running its TensorRT-LLM software won every test of AI inference capabilities. In June, Hopper-based systems gave the best performance on every AI training workload.\n\nHowever, superior GPUs are only one piece of the puzzle. Nvidia also provides adjacent hardware like high-performance networking platforms and central processing units (CPUs) purpose-built for AI. CEO Jensen Huang recently said, \"We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond that, Nvidia CUDA is the most comprehensive ecosystem of supporting software for developers. CUDA includes tools for data preparation, model training, and deployment, which collectively streamline AI application development. That advantage will be hard to overcome because the CUDA ecosystem has been nearly two decades in the making, and Nvidia is still adding new tools at a steady clip today.\n\n\"Year after year, Nvidia responded to the needs of software developers by pumping out specialized libraries of code, allowing a huge array of tasks to be performed on its GPUs at speeds that were impossible with conventional, general-purpose processors like those made by Intel and AMD,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNvidia shares are not cheap, but the price is justified by future growth prospects\n\nGrand View Research expects AI spending across hardware, software, and services to grow at 37% annually through 2030. That means Nvidia will have a strong tailwind at its back for many years to come, and the company is unlikely to lose its dominance in AI hardware any time soon.\n\nToshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs recently wrote, \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de fact industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities, as well as the installed base and ecosystem it has built over multiple decades.\"\n\nThat said, Nvidia has reportedly delayed shipments of its latest Blackwell GPUs by at least three months due to a design flaw. Blackwell chips deliver up to four times faster training and 30 times faster inference than the previous Hopper architecture. That delay could drive worse-than-expected results when the company reports earnings on Aug. 28, which could cause the stock to decline.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP earnings at 52% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends January 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 57.7 times non-GAAP earnings look reasonable. Investors interested in purchasing shares of Nvidia should start with a small position today. If the stock falls after the upcoming earnings report, investors should consider using that opportunity to build a slightly larger position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): Evaluating Growth Potential and Market Position in the Evolving Data Center Industry",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) against the other computer hardware stocks.\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the computer hardware market is projected to grow from $674.44 billion in 2023 to $710.32 billion in 2024, with a 5.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), mainly driven by personal computing, global supply chains, internet expansion, and more data centers.\n\nBy 2028, the market is expected to reach $914.55 billion at a 6.5% CAGR, fueled by trends like remote work infrastructure, sustainable practices, smart city development, and digital transformation. Key trends include edge computing, AI integration, modular systems, biometric security, and hybrid cloud environments, with significant investments in smart city projects, particularly in China.\n\nThe most important trends in the advancement of computer hardware are AI and machine learning which are revolutionizing hardware design and enabling applications like autonomous vehicles and robotics. Apart from that, the Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding, connecting more devices in smart homes, cities, and industries. It has led to a focus on improving security, efficiency, and the ability of different IoT devices, systems, and technologies to work together seamlessly.\n\nRole of AI in the Growth of the Computer Hardware Industry\n\nOn May 28, Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ and said that we’re still in a phase of AI development where hardware is crucial. Companies like NVIDIA are thriving because their products are essential for running large AI models, which require immense computational power. He said that this situation is similar to how search engines, like Google or Bing, have long relied on substantial investments in hardware to function effectively.\n\nFertik added that as AI technology evolves, there will be a shift. The costs associated with AI hardware will decrease, and smaller, more specialized AI models will emerge, which will be tailored for specific industries or purposes.\n\nWhen this happens, the focus and financial gains will also move toward software and computer science (software testing and development) companies. However, they will not significantly move from computer hardware companies and they will still benefit from the growing AI industry.\n\nIndustry Has Room for Growth Beyond AI\n\nA major growth prospect for computer hardware is quantum computing, an industry that is expected to reach $11.4 billion by 2027 from $2.74 billion in 2022, according to Research and Markets. Quantum Computing offers significant benefits by improving the speed and efficiency of complex computations.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike classical computers, which process bits as 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits that can represent multiple states at once, which enables them to solve problems much faster. This is especially valuable in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and optimization as it solves complex simulations and calculations that are currently infeasible for classical computers.\n\nQuantum Computing can significantly benefit the computer hardware industry by driving advancements in technology and creating new markets. Similar to AI, the development of quantum hardware requires innovations in materials science, cooling systems, and chip design, which can push the boundaries of traditional hardware engineering.\n\nAs quantum computers become more practical, they will require specialized hardware components, which will create new opportunities for companies to develop and supply these advanced technologies. For more details, you can read our article about the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and other financial media websites to identify 12 computer hardware companies with market capitalizations of above $1 billion. The analyst comments and ratings were mostly taken from The Fly and TipRanks.\n\nA team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI)\n\nStock Price as of August 9: $508.76\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside as of August 9: 36.21%\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a California-based tech company that focuses on the design, manufacture, and marketing of advanced server and storage systems that are essential for contemporary IT infrastructure. The company’s product range includes high-performance servers, modular blade servers, and specialized storage solutions, made for the needs of diverse markets such as data centers, cloud computing, AI, and edge computing. The company offers a variety of products, including complete server systems, server management software, networking equipment, and essential server components such as motherboards and power supplies.\n\nAmong its prominent products is the SuperServer series, which features models like the SuperServer 6029TP-HTR, built for demanding computational tasks. Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) also offers Blade Servers with modular designs that optimize space usage in data centers. Additionally, the company’s Rack Solutions provides flexible configurations designed to meet the needs of enterprise environments.\n\nAs per the coverage of 19 analysts, Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has an average price target of $693.00, which represents an upside of 36.21% from the current levels, as of August 9. It takes the fourth spot on our list of the best computer hardware stocks to buy now.\n\nSuper Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been experiencing remarkable growth, largely fueled by the rising need for AI servers. In its Q4 earnings report, which covers the period ending June 30, the company showcased an impressive 110% increase in revenue, reaching approximately $15 billion. This surge reflects the strong demand for its products, with adjusted earnings per share nearly doubling from $11.81 in fiscal 2023 to $22.09.\n\nDespite facing some short-term challenges, particularly with lower-than-expected gross margins, Super Micro’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) long-term outlook remains positive. On August 7, an analyst from JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a $950 price target. They acknowledged the initial concerns about margin softness but highlighted that these are temporary.\n\nThey anticipate that as the company overcomes current manufacturing inefficiencies and adjusts strategic pricing, margins will improve. This optimism is further supported by the firm’s projection of enhanced gross margins in the coming quarters, along with limited impact from delays in NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell solutions.\n\nThe company is also well-positioned to benefit from emerging trends in data center technology. Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has made significant strides in the direct liquid cooling (DLC) market, which is gaining traction due to the increasing power demands of AI servers. The company introduced its new liquid-cooled solutions at Computex in early June, and since then, demand has exceeded expectations.\n\nAs per CEO Charles Liang, the company has already shipped around 1,000 liquid-cooled racks in just a couple of months, which represents more than 15% of new global data center deployments during that period. Moreover, the company forecasts that 25% to 30% of new data center setups will adopt DLC solutions within the next year.\n\nThe Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund stated the following regarding Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are benchmark-agnostic, so we spend our time researching current or potential EGCs, not analyzing indexes. However, this quarter there was inescapable attention on one AI-related company, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), which makes servers that hold Nvidia’s (NVDA) graphics processing units. Pundits wondered if Super Micro was the next AI “meme stock” set to soar like Nvidia. Super Micro’s stock price was up 255% in the first quarter and indeed is up a jaw-dropping 848% in the last year. Importantly, Super Micro is in the Russell 2000® Growth index, and alone accounted for over a third, or 2.82%, of the index’s 7.58% total return this quarter. However, Super Micro is not a company we could have ever owned. The company generated more than $7 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, far above our current maximum revenue threshold. In fact, when the company came public in March 2007, it was already too large for our portfolio. Now, the company is so large that it moved into the S&P 500 index at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, not owning Super Micro was the largest detractor to our performance versus the index this quarter, comprising more than one-third of our underperformance. This, to us, is a reminder why an index is not always an accurate gauge of our short-term performance.”\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 4th on our list of the best computer hardware stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Microsoft 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Microsoft is the second-largest company in the world with a market cap of just under $3 trillion as of this writing. The tech giant has managed to reach this position thanks to its solid presence across multiple applications such as cloud computing, its popular Windows operating system, and workplace collaboration tools.\n\nLately, artificial intelligence (AI) has turned out to be another solid growth driver for Microsoft, contributing to an acceleration in the company's growth in recent quarters. However, Microsoft isn't the only tech giant that is using AI as a springboard to boost its growth. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are also benefiting from the booming adoption of AI in their respective industries.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the prospects of Nvidia and Meta Platforms over the next decade to find out why they have the potential to overtake Microsoft's market cap in the long run.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is currently the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft with a market cap of $2.56 trillion. The semiconductor specialist's value has shot up remarkably since the end of 2022, when it became evident that its data center graphics processing units (GPUs) will play a central role in the proliferation of AI.\n\nMicrosoft partner OpenAI used Nvidia's GPUs to train ChatGPT, the generative AI chatbot that exploded in popularity following its launch in late 2022. Since then, tech giants across the globe have been lining up to buy Nvidia's AI GPUs to train and deploy AI models. This has allowed the chipmaker to control more than 80% of the AI chip market, leaving very little for rivals such as AMD.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh estimates that Nvidia could generate a whopping $200 billion in data center revenue next year with demand for its next-generation Blackwell AI chips reportedly stronger than expected. That would be a significant jump over the $47.5 billion data center revenue Nvidia reported last year.\n\nMeanwhile, consensus estimates indicate that Nvidia's data center revenue could increase to $140 billion next year, which would still be a significant jump over its revenue from this segment last year. For perspective, AMD is expecting to sell $4.5 billion worth of data center GPUs this year, which tells us just how dominant Nvidia has been in this market.\n\nGiven that Nvidia will be releasing a new AI GPU every year, as compared to its earlier plan of refreshing its lineup every two years, it could continue commanding a solid share of the AI chip market after 10 years. With the overall market for GPUs expected to be worth $1.16 trillion in 2034, according to Future Market Insights, Nvidia's strong standing in this market sets it up for robust growth over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings to clock an annual growth rate of 42% over the next five years. That's higher than the 13% annual earnings growth that Microsoft is expected to deliver over the same period.\n\nNvidia's huge end-market opportunity and its dominant share suggest that it could keep growing at a faster pace than Microsoft beyond the next five years, potentially over the next decade. As such, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia eventually overtaking Microsoft's market cap after 10 years.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is currently the seventh-largest company in the world with a market cap of $1.25 trillion, which means that it is quite some distance away from Microsoft. However, the impressive pace at which Meta has been growing recently thanks to the growing adoption of its AI-powered advertising tools suggests that it could maintain a healthy pace of growth over the next decade.\n\nAccording to eMarketer, digital ad spending could increase by 13.2% in 2024. Meta is on track to grow at a faster pace than the industry it operates in. The company's revenue in the first six months of the year increased by 24% to $75.5 billion. Its revenue forecast of $39.75 billion for the current quarter would translate to year-over-year growth of 16%, which would again be higher than the pace at which digital ad spending is forecast to grow this year.\n\nMeta's ability to drive greater returns for advertisers with the help of AI-powered ad campaigns is helping the company attract more ad dollars. Management said on the recent earnings conference call that U.S. advertisers witnessed a 22% jump in returns after adopting Meta's AI-powered ad tools such as Advantage+.\n\nThese AI tools are allowing advertisers who are using Meta's offerings to improve audience targeting, drive incremental purchases from that audience, and reduce acquisition costs. Meta witnessed a 10% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered in Q2, along with a 10% improvement in the average price per ad.\n\nThe global digital ad market is expected to be worth a whopping $1.76 trillion in 2034, up from this year's estimated revenue of $467 billion, according to Prophecy Market Insights. Meta is expected to deliver $161 billion in revenue in 2024, which means that it could end the year with a third of the digital ad market under its control.\n\nIf the company continues to grab a bigger share of this lucrative end-market opportunity in the long run, its revenue could increase significantly in the future. Assuming Meta could bump its digital ad market share to 40% in 2034, its revenue could hit a whopping $704 billion. That would be more than four times the company's projected 2024 revenue.\n\nGiven that the U.S. technology sector has a price-to-sales ratio of 7, Meta could witness a significant expansion in its market cap in the long run if it trades at that valuation. So, Meta Platforms indeed has the potential to become a bigger company than Microsoft in the coming decade thanks to its improving influence in the digital ad market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock posted significant gains in Monday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price climbed 4.1% in the daily session, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia stock got a boost in today's trading as investors and analysts reassessed the impact of a potential delay for the first generation of the company's upcoming Blackwell processors. The company's share price likely also got a boost from news that the graphics processing unit (GPU) frontrunner had signed a new AI training deal with the state of California.\n\nNvidia continues to rack up public sector wins\n\nNvidia has been touting the importance of developing AI systems for countries. The company anticipates a dramatic ramping of public sector spending to develop artificial intelligence systems as countries aim to shore up national defense capabilities and overall sovereignty. The announcement of the new training partnership with California reflects a similar dynamic on a U.S.-state level. It wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia announce additional AI training deals with other states in the near future.\n\nIs Nvidia stock on track for more big gains?\n\nUBS published a report on Nvidia today, maintaining a buy rating on the stock and a one-year price target of $150 per share. The artificial intelligence leader's stock has seen volatile trading recently as investors have weighed concerns about expectations that its first Blackwell processors will be delayed. With the company closing out today's daily session valued at roughly $109 per share, UBS' price target suggests near-term upside of roughly 38%.\n\nThe first releases in the Blackwell line are expected to deliver a substantial leap forward in processing power and were expected to be a major performance driver for Nvidia this year. In general, the market has also shown some skittishness lately when it comes to valuations for megacap companies and leading AI players. But the bank thinks the tech stock is undervalued at current prices.\n\nUBS expects that a potential delay for the first Blackwell processors would still have them releasing by the end of January 2025, and the bank's analysts on the stock think overall demand for Nvidia's processors will remain very strong. While some analysts have projected that the AI leader's earnings will hit a near-term peak in 2025, UBS thinks profits will likely grow in 2026 as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia's Earnings Set For 'Drop The Mic' Moment As Investors Anticipate 'Massive' AI Demand Forecast From CEO Jensen Huang, Says Tech Bull\n\nThe upcoming earnings report from NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be a pivotal moment for the company, according to a prominent analyst.\n\nWhat Happened: Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, predicts that the earnings report, scheduled for Aug. 28, will be a significant event for the tech industry.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. This startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nIves emphasized that the earnings call will capture the attention of investors globally, as they await insights from CEO Jensen Huang on the future demand for artificial intelligence chips through 2025.\n\n“Nvidia earnings on August 28th you will be able to hear a pin drop on trading desks around the Street/globe as investors hear from the Godfather of AI Jensen on the massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025 which we believe will be another drop the mic moment for tech,” Ives wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nNvidia earnings on August 28th you will be able to hear a pin drop on trading desks around the Street/globe as investors hear from the Godfather of AI Jensen on the massive demand trajectory for AI chips into 2025 which we believe will be another drop the mic moment for tech 🔥\n\n— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) August 12, 2024\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nWhy It Matters: Nvidia has seen a significant decline in market value, dropping by $900 billion since its peak in June, despite the ongoing surge in AI spending. Major tech companies like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have committed to continued investment in AI infrastructure, which represents over 40% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\nAdditionally, the “Magnificent Seven” mega-cap stocks, including Nvidia, have been at the forefront of market volatility. Despite a 30% drop from their five-year peak valuations, they remain 50% above their five-year troughs. This group, which includes major players in IT, communication services, and the electric vehicle industry, continues to wield significant influence over the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFurthermore, notable figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)  have shown confidence in Nvidia’s future by purchasing additional shares. Pelosi recently disclosed acquiring more Nvidia shares while selling part of her stake in Microsoft.\n\nLastly, early tech investor James Anderson has predicted that Nvidia could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade, driven by the growing demand for AI chips. This bullish outlook has contributed to Nvidia’s shares soaring by 117% since the beginning of the year.\n\nPrice Action: Nvidia’s stock closed at $104.75 on Friday, down 0.21% for the day. In after-hours trading, the stock inched up 0.019%. Year to date, Nvidia’s stock has surged by an impressive 117.46%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500.

        "title": "Why Intel Stock Kept Going Down Today",
        "content": "According to a Wall Street Journal that appeared in print this morning, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock is too big to fail. Based on trading today, investors aren't so sure about that.\n\nShares of the once-upon-a-time semiconductor king slipped 2% through 1:45 p.m. ET on Monday, extending an almost uninterrupted slide in share price since the company's disastrous second-quarter earnings report that has cost the stock 37% in just a little over a week and a half.\n\nWhat the WSJ says about Intel\n\nIn the column, the Journal argued that while Intel will take a long time and a lot of money to turn itself around, its recovery is inevitable for several reasons. First and foremost, the company has factories that are actually worth more than the stock currently sells for, and these are \"key to Intel's staying power.\"\n\nThe importance of semiconductors to modern life and modern economies, says the Journal, means the U.S. government cannot allow Intel to fail as a business. The publication points to the 2022 Chip Act passed by Congress, and the $8.5 billion in subsidies that the government awarded to Intel to assist it in building new chip factories in Arizona and Ohio.\n\nAlthough these factories aren't currently running at full capacity (a big reason Intel's earnings missed by so much), the Journal says that Intel could fill out their capacity if it either figures out a way to compete with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in artificial intelligence chips, or farms out unused capacity to other chipmakers as a foundry (or contract chipmaker).\n\nIs Intel stock a buy?\n\nThe problem for Intel, and for its investors, is that whichever of these tracks Intel takes, the strategy will take time to succeed.\n\nIn the meantime, investors must resign themselves to owning a second-tier chipmaker with an operating profit margin worse than any of the companies it has to compete with: AMD(NASDAQ: AMD) at 4.6%, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) at 42.6%, or Nvidia at 64.9%.\n\nWith numbers like these, it's hard to call Intel stock a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy the 3 Worst Nasdaq 100 Stocks Since the Tech Sector Selloff?",
        "content": "The tech sector selloff that began in July gave investors the jitters. The best tech stocks were in freefall after carrying the Nasdaq 100 to new heights. In fact, the index is still in correction territory as it is down more than 10% from its all-time high.\n\nSome of the leading names in the tech industry also remain lower by double-digit percentages. They might still be up by large amounts for the year, but Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is down 13% since the Nasdaq selloff, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 14% lower and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is down almost 18%. Yet, they weren’t the worst Nasdaq 100 stocks. Quite a few companies fared even worse.\n\nIs this just a temporary setback, or is the rotation out of tech names and more small-cap positions a trend that will continue? Let’s take a closer look at the three worst Nasdaq 100 stocks that are down 40% on average from just one month ago to see whether you should buy them at these deeply discounted prices.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDexCom (DXCM) DexCom headquarters in San Diego, CA, USA. DexCom, Inc. is a company that manufactures glucose monitoring systems. DXCM stock\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical device maker DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) focuses primarily on the Type 1 diabetes market. Its continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have been the leading product in the space for years, and it was looking to gain a foothold in the larger Type 2 diabetes market. Yet, DexCom stumbled hard in the second quarter, sending its stock crashing.\n\nRevenue rose 15% to $1 billion, just missing analyst expectations. However, it handily beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share, reporting adjusted profits of 43 cents. But what caused DXCM stock to plummet 40% was management slashing its full-year sales outlook. It previously guided toward revenue of $4.2 to $4.35 billion. Now it says to expect $4 to $4.05 billion, or $200 to $300 million less.\n\nDexCom is experiencing significantly fewer patient starts than previously expected. It had 70,000 fewer new patients starts globally in Q2, or 25% fewer than what management forecast. While executives also see Q3 being down, it should regain its previous level in Q4. DexCom also lost market share in the durable medical equipment market. With slowing growth, it is hard to recommend DXCM stock at this juncture until it can show growth again.\n\nIntel (INTC) New Intel logo seen on the screen and blurred fingertip touching it in a dark.

INTC stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor stock Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is falling further behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race. The outlook for ever catching up seems bleak. Sales are falling, profits evaporated and Intel just said it was cutting over 15,000 jobs to control costs. Also, its dividend is now a thing of the past. The chipmaker eliminated the payout to further save money. There is little reason to wonder why INTC stock is down 43% since the tech selloff began.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel’s problems are structural. Although being vertically integrated should offer the chipmaker efficiencies and economies, it is not working out like that. Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and even Broadcom farm out the chip manufacturing process to third parties. Intel is also a foundry and owning the means of production comes at a cost. It is looking to save $10 billion in costs in 2025.\n\nWall Street has now drastically revised its outlook. Where analysts had been looking for $1.08 per share in earnings, they now see just 27 cents. They are looking for a drop in sales too, down to $52.3 billion. Investors should stay away from Intel stock.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe worst Nasdaq 100 stock is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). It’s stock is down 42% since the tech selloff began. While it was one of the best performers beforehand, and the stock is still up over 80% in 2024, earnings also did in the AI server maker.\n\nWhile second-quarter revenue rocketed 144% higher to $5.3 billion, its results showed profit margins were dramatically compressing. Gross margins narrowed 580 basis points to just 11.2%, indicating its expenses were significantly rising. As competition in the space is keen, Super Micro seemingly wanted to maintain its market share and didn’t pass along its higher input costs to its customers.\n\nThe impact was felt on the bottom line as adjusted earnings per share shot 78% higher to $6.25 per share but that was way short of Wall Street’s forecast for $8.07 per share.\n\nAlthough management thinks it can get margins back up toward its previous levels, it is not the easy path it once looked like. Wall Street now sees revenue growth quickly decelerating. It forecasts a 77% jump this year to $26.5 billion but then it falls off a cliff in fiscal 2026. Analysts project just 19% growth that year to $31.64 billion.\n\nWhenever a company is expected to see growth falter, investors would be wise to sit on the sidelines until the dust settles.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bank of America analysts have identified three semiconductor stocks that they believe are poised to outperform as the SOX index faces a potential rebound in the fourth quarter.\n\nDespite the SOX's modest 13% year-to-date gain, the index has faced seasonal headwinds and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. However, Bank of America sees a potential recovery starting in October, which could lead to a strong finish for the year.\n\n\"If history is any guide, SOX could recover starting in October, with CQ4 and CQ1 the two strongest quarters for semi stock performance (7-10.5% avg. returns, 400bps+ ahead of SPX, since 2010),\" wrote the bank.\n\nIn their latest note, BofA analysts emphasize that the SOX is still in the early stages of an upcycle. \"We are only in Quarter 4 of this upcycle that started in September 2023 and has produced 28% SOX returns, while prior upcycles have lasted 10 quarters and generated 67% average SOX returns,\" they noted.\n\nThis historical context suggests that the current cycle has more room to run.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on this potential rebound, BofA highlights three top picks: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and KLA Corporation (KLAC). These companies are described as \"the most profitable vendors in their respective end-markets,\" making them strong candidates to lead the SOX's recovery.\n\nWhile the note acknowledges ongoing volatility and the potential for a slower, more recessionary scenario, the analysts maintain that these three stocks are well-positioned to benefit from a benign rebound in the SOX index.\n\nAs the fourth quarter approaches, BofA says investors may find these chip stocks to be attractive opportunities to ride out the market's ups and downs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n3 chip stocks to buy to play a rebound in SOX: BofA\n\nX hit with Austrian data use complaint over AI training\n\nBlink Fitness files for bankruptcy to pursue sale\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks is a must for a stable and growth-oriented portfolio. These companies offer solid fundamentals and reliable returns. Here, the focus is on three such companies in sectors with stable growth.\n\nThe digital payment industry is booming because of the global shift to cashless transactions and new technologies that provide security and ease of use. As this trend accelerates, companies in this sector are positioned for sustained revenue growth. Artificial intelligence in cloud computing is becoming very resourceful and highly in demand. As companies pioneer AI-powered cloud services, they capitalize on this increasing need for scalable data solutions; it’s an area that calls for much-needed investment.\n\nLastly, companies with a robust global market presence are not just about revenue diversification; they are about stability. Their ability to weather economic downturns and consistently perform well ensures reliable returns for investors​.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBy focusing on such high-potential sectors, investors can ensure stability with growth in a portfolio for long-term financial success.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) specializes in digital payments and financial technology. Its extensive two-sided network is a significant strength that creates substantial network effects. In the second quarter, PayPal had 429 million total active accounts and 222 million monthly active accounts, a steady sequential increase from the previous quarter. Certainly, the large user base creates a self-reinforcing cycle, and increased consumer adoption attracts more merchants.\n\nAdditionally, PayPal operates in a massive $6 trillion global e-commerce market. The ongoing digitization of payments provides substantial growth opportunities to build omnichannel capabilities. To capture a larger market share, PayPal offers value-added services. By addressing online and offline payment needs, PayPal expands its addressable market, enhancing its value proposition to consumers and merchants.\n\nIn Q2, PayPal’s total payment volume (TPV) grew by 11% year over year. TPV reached $417 billion. This growth was consistent in the U.S. and international markets. The company’s revenue increased by 8%, highlighting strong performance despite macroeconomic challenges. The transaction margin dollars grew by 8% from a year ago, more than a 3% improvement from Q1. The company achieves this through increased transaction volumes and operational efficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, PayPal’s extensive network of consumers and merchants strengthens its position among blue-chip stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) products\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) focuses on cloud computing and software solutions. Azure’s share gains accelerated due to advancements in AI. Investments in data center expansions span four continents, supporting long-term growth and global reach. Microsoft introduced AI accelerators from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Azure Maia and the new Cobalt 100 enhance high-performance computing, showcasing Microsoft’s focus on cutting-edge technology in cloud services.\n\nMoreover, Azure AI’s customer base grew to over 60,000, which marks a nearly 60% increase from a year ago. The average spend per customer is rising. This growth signifies rising demand and trust in Microsoft’s AI capabilities. Azure Arc’s customer base increased by 90% from last year. It now serves 36,000 customers.\n\nFurther, Azure Arc aids in seamless cloud migrations that prove Microsoft’s ability to cater to diverse industry needs. The Azure VMware Solution is the fastest, most cost-effective way to migrate VMware workloads. This emphasizes Microsoft’s efficient, customer-centric approach. Indeed, Microsoft’s hyperscale cloud is the top choice for SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) workloads. This reinforces Microsoft’s capability in handling mission-critical enterprise applications.\n\nOverall, its lead in AI integration and significant market share in cloud services make it a high mark on the top blue-chip stocks list.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) operates a global payment network for transactions. Visa’s key business drivers show stability and growth, which is crucial for long-term expansion. In constant dollars, overall payment volume grew 7% from a year ago, indicating a steady increase in Visa’s payment network usage. U.S. payments volume grew 5%, which showcases Visa’s solid domestic market presence. Visa maintains growth in a mature market.\n\nFurther, International payments volume grew by 10%, highlighting Visa’s successful international expansion. Visa effectively leverages global opportunities as cross-border volumes show significant growth. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 14%, underscoring the increasing adoption of international transactions.\n\nMoreover, these transactions have higher fees and contribute more to revenue. Processed transactions grew 10% in the last year. More transactions handled by Visa’s network led to higher fees and data processing revenue. Certainly, Visa’s high and improving net promoter score (NPS) reflects strong client satisfaction. Strong client satisfaction is critical for long-term success. Visa achieved a global NPS of 76, up three points from the previous year, which indicates high client satisfaction and loyalty. Hence, high satisfaction can lead to increased usage of Visa’s services.\n\nOverall, consistent revenue growth, high client satisfaction, and stable business drivers reinforce Visa’s blue-chip stock status.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL and VZ.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Says AI Stocks Like Meta Platforms (META) are in ‘Bubble Land’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms is a key player in the Mag. 7 group of stocks which, according to Elliott Management, are in a bubble.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it’s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains “incrementally positive” on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\n\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\n\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\n\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\n\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company’s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it’s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year’s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year’s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Stocks Poised for Potential Long-Term Growth",
        "content": "You don’t always have to accept a sky-high valuation as part of doing business with growth investing. Some stocks present captivating growth opportunities while presenting reasonable valuations for their investors.\n\nHowever, valuation is only one piece of the puzzle. Many telecom stocks have some of the lowest P/E ratios in the stock market, but these same companies don’t grow by much. Most of them are stagnant with very limited upside and high yields to compensate for fading growth prospects.\n\nThe best stocks don’t just have reasonable valuations. They also have rising revenue and profit margins. Strong financial success and growth catalysts can make a stock with a 50 P/E ratio look undervalued.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, a stock with an 8 P/E ratio can look overvalued if the c company’s revenue and profits are shrinking.\n\nInvestors looking for undervalued stocks may want to consider these promising opportunities for long-term growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still undervalued, despite being one of the largest corporations on the planet. The stock has a $1.3 trillion market cap, but it only has a 26 P/E ratio.\n\nFurthermore, net income growth is booming. The company reported a 73% YOY increase in profits during the second quarter of 2024. Soaring profits suggest that the P/E ratio will go even lower.\n\nNet income isn’t the only thing going up. Meta Platforms also reported 22% YOY revenue growth as consumers continue to click on advertisements.\n\nAdditional ad spend during the Olympics plus the extra social media engagement from the games can result in a strong third quarter. The company has 3.27 billion daily active users spread across its family of apps.\n\nMost Wall Street analysts are on board and believe that the stock can rally from current levels. Meta Platforms is rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 11% upside.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) may come as a surprise if you haven’t heard anything about the retailer for several years. However, this stock has done more than just beat the market.\n\nIts year-to-date gains are higher than every Magnificent Seven stock, except Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and its 5-year gains are better than every Magnificent Seven stock except Nvidia and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe American lifestyle retailer has posted a 63% year-to-date gain and a commanding 848% gain over the past five years. The stock’s rally caught many people off guard, but the valuation still looks good. Abercrombie & Fitch trades at a 18.48 P/E ratio, and profit margins have been soaring.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn just a few quarters, net profit margins went from mid single-digits to firmly above 10%. That also comes with three consecutive quarters of more than 20% YOY revenue growth, including 22.1% YOY growth in the first quarter.\n\nNet income per diluted share came to $2.14 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch even has $864 million in cash along with a $7.6 billion market cap.

        "title": "Market Alert: The Dip in Arm Holdings Stock Is a Buying Opportunity",
        "content": "Down 32% in the last month, the current decline in British microchip and semiconductor company Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is a buying opportunity. As a result, investors are setting their sights on Arm Holdings stock. However, should you?\n\nArm Holdings, whose microchips can be found in nearly every smartphone, has been on a tear since the company held its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2023. Since its market debut less than 12 months ago, Arm Holdings stock has risen an impressive 93%. And that’s after the pullback that has occurred with the broader market in the last two months. The stock’s performance has been strong enough to get it added to the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nLooking forward, there are plenty of reasons to remain bullish on this leading chip stock and its future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStrong Growth\n\nOn Aug. 1, Arm Holdings issued second-quarter financial results that showed strong growth at the company. Arm reported EPS of 40 cents versus 34 cents that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $939 million, which beat consensus estimates of $902.7 million. Arm’s revenue was up 39% from a year earlier. Management said the company continues to benefit from strong global demand. The demand for its chips and processors that are used in smartphones and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nDespite the good news, ARM stock got knocked 10% lower after the company issued forward guidance. This disappointed analysts and investors. Specifically, Arm Holdings maintained its full-year guidance. It calls for $1.45 to $1.65 in EPS and $3.80 billion to $4.10 billion in revenue. Analysts expected $1.58 in earnings and sales of $4.02 billion. The guidance is still ahead of what Wall Street had been seeking. However, management’s failure to lift its outlook overshadowed what was otherwise a great print.\n\nReporting Change\n\nIt also didn’t help that Arm said that it is no longer going to report the number of microchips that it ships globally, starting in the current third quarter. “As we shift our focus to higher-value, lower-volume markets such as data center servers, AI accelerators and smartphone applications processors, the number of chips reported as shipped is less representative of our performance,” said the company in its earnings release.\n\nFor the record, Arm shipped seven billion microchips in this year’s second quarter. Going forward, Arm said it plans to focus more on the royalty revenue it generates from its microchips and processors. The company currently has 33 microchip and semiconductor licenses. It earns regular royalty fees from these licenses. Still, the changes to Arm’s financial reporting structure have caused a negative reaction from many investors and analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBullish Calls\n\nDespite the grumblings about the change to its reporting structure, analysts largely remain bullish on ARM stock and continue to upgrade their ratings and price targets. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), for example, recently upgraded Arm stock to a “buy” rating from “hold” previously and increased its price target to $190 a share from $107. Morgan Stanley’s price target is 62% higher than where Arm’s shares currently trade.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley say that Arm continues to have a big opportunity and catalyst with AI computing moving to the edge in mobile, automotive, and personal computers. Overall, ARM stock currently has a “moderate buy” rating with 14 analysts rating the stock a “buy,” four analysts rating it a “hold” and one analyst labeling it a “sell.” The median price target on Arm stock is 20% higher than where it currently trades.\n\nBuy ARM Stock\n\nMost microchip and semiconductor stocks are experiencing a drawdown right now as the hype surrounding AI cools off and investors rotate capital out of tech stocks and into small-cap securities. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has dropped 18% in the last month. The pullback in Arm stock has been exacerbated by the company maintaining its guidance and announcing changes to its reporting structure. But these are all near-term headwinds. In the long term, Arm Holdings stock is still a leading microchip design company and well-positioned for future growth. ARM stock is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

Based on factors like earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment, these A-rated tech stocks are in the best bets for investors who are looking to capitalize on the correction we’ve endured for the last few weeks.\n\nWhile the recent downturn in the Nasdaq indexes may cause some investors to hesitate, those with a long-term perspective should view this correction as an opportunity to invest in A-rated tech stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) technology company. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the highest-profile tech stock on this list, and with good reason. The company soared to previously unimaginable heights over the last year as its high-powered graphics processing units powered the advancement of generative AI for many companies.\n\nNvidia’s H100 model GPUs can cost between $22,000 and $40,000 each, depending on the model, and companies have been buying them hand over fist.\n\nThat’s why Nvidia has been recording massive earnings numbers for the last few quarters, including 262% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia has a near-monopoly on these high-powered GPUs and should keep profits rolling in even as Big Tech companies work on manufacturing their own custom-made GPUs.

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been around forever. If you use a personal computer – and who doesn’t these days? – then you thank IBM, because it rolled out the first PC in 1981.\n\nBut the past is the past, and investors are more interested in what IBM is doing today an its prospects for the future.\n\nIBM stays relevant by being one of the top cloud infrastructure providers in the world.

Do you remember when it first came out in the late 1990s and got a buzz with its raunchy, suggestive commercials? While it got people talking, it didn’t do a lot for GoDaddy’s brand.\n\nFortunately, GoDaddy worked to get away from the connotations of those early ad campaigns.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This Self Driving Car Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\n\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\n\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let’s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\n\nThe Global Autonomous Vehicle Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\n\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\n\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\n\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\n\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest Trends in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry\n\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\n\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading technology company that specializes in graphic processing units and computing solutions for an array of industries including gaming, data canters, autonomous automotive, professional visualization, and much more. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA), NVIDIA Drive Platform provides end-to-end solutions to support the development of autonomous driving technology.\n\nThe company posted a successful first quarter of 2025, with revenue growing 262% year-over-year to $26 billion backed by exceptional performance in its Data Center and Gaming segments. The Data Center revenue was up 427% year-over-year to reach $22.6 billion during the quarter, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU used for training LLMs, recommendation engines, and generative AI. Management believes the automotive sector to be one of the key vertices within its Data Center segment and expects Auto to be the largest vertical driving multi-billion revenue opportunity during the year.\n\nThe automotive revenue of the company grew 11% year-over-year to reach $329 million and was primarily driven by the self-driving platforms. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has experienced a ramp-up in its AI cockpit solutions and global OEM customers translating to its subsequent growth in revenue.\n\nThe competitive edge of the company lies in its huge market capitalization and its ability to collaborate with leading automakers to deliver autonomous driving solutions. Some of the notable achievements for the company during the quarter include the successful launch of  Xiaomi’s first electric vehicle built on NVIDIA Orin. Moreover, the company has also announced new design wins for its NVIDIA Drive Thor quoting significant partnerships with BYD, XPENG, Nuro, and GAC’s AION Hyper.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the best autonomous vehicle stocks because it was held by 186 hedge funds in Q1 2024, with total stakes worth $48.30 million. Renaissance Technologies is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $867.5 million, as of August 11. 61 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $140 presenting an upside of 34% from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the best self driving car stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Powered by Nvidia and AI, humanoid ambitions take shape",
        "content": "When the Department of Defense commenced its robotics challenge in 2015, the stated goal was to develop ground robots that can aid in disaster recovery with the help of human operators. Each android was given an hour to complete eight tasks, which included driving a car and climbing some stairs.\n\nNearly a decade later, generative AI is accelerating that learning curve, pushing human-like machines to pick up new tasks in real time.\n\n“The holy grail for us is what we call zero-shot learning, or the ability to show the robot what to do, and it can do it the same way that you do that task,” said Jeff Cardenas, co-founder of Apptronik, an Austin-based robotics maker.\n\nThat vision is slowly becoming reality. Last week, OpenAI-backed Figure unveiled the latest iteration of its humanoid robot. The robot is equipped with a vision language model that allows the machine to reason visually and self-correct learned behavior, according to the company’s claims.\n\nAnd in June, Tesla (TSLA) presented an updated version of its Optimus robot at Tesla’s Investor Day and showed it roaming a factory floor. CEO Elon Musk touted the robot’s potential, saying it had the ability to push the company’s market cap to $25 trillion. Tesla's humanoid robot is displayed at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China, on July 6, 2023. (REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nRobotics have been integrated into factory floors and warehouses to improve efficiencies for years. But current machines in use have largely been limited to moving from point A to point B and tackling a handful of tasks.\n\nHumanoids that can adapt to existing environments have long been seen as the ultimate test if they can work alongside humans in spaces built for them.\n\n“If you want a versatile robot, then having a robot that can retrofit into our environment so you don’t have to change anything seems important,” said Cardenas. “Today, three to six [times] the price of the robot is spent just integrating that robot into a new workflow.”\n\nNvidia humanoid ambition\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is driving rapid development through an ecosystem built specifically for humanoids. It combines high-powered chips that process data at high speeds with the omniverse, a digital world that allows users to train robots on skills applied in the real world.\n\nThe company announced the development of AI foundation models earlier this year. Just last month, Nvidia unveiled “NIM Microservices,” a visual training ground that allows generative AI models to visually interpret their surroundings in 3D.\n\n“Before, when we used to do an AI model for doing a particular task, we had to train it with specific data for that task … and if you needed that AI model to do something different, you needed to retrain that model,” said Deepu Talla, Nvidia's vice president of Robotics and Edge Computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s ecosystem now enables robots to train using text and speech input, in addition to live demonstrations. Apollo, the humanoid robot, completes tasks in a kitchen. (Apptronik) (Apptronik)\n\nThose advancements have helped supercharge development at Apptronik, one of a handful of robotics companies Nvidia has partnered with. The company recently achieved a big milestone at its Austin headquarters when its humanoid robot, Apollo, autonomously performed tasks trained through visual learning. The machine was seen picking up a pair of socks and a hat and packing it into a box. A task that once took thousands of hours to train on took just 10 hours, according to the company.\n\n“If we build big data sets of humans doing tasks in these environments and we have robots with the same morphology as a person, then that allows us to have robots that can do a whole wide range of tasks over time,” said Cardenas.\n\nThat potential has attracted record funding from investors. Humanoid robotics companies raised nearly $793 million in the first half of 2024, according to data from CB Insights.\n\nGoldman Sachs projects the android market will reach $38 billion by 2035.\n\n“If you have a robot that can really do anything a human can, then that fundamentally changes the economy as we know it, right?” said Sam Korus, director of Research, Autonomous Technology, and Robotics at Ark Invest. “Then there’s no more constraint on human labor.”\n\nTech leaders have been quick to caution that more humanoids won’t necessarily mean fewer human jobs. However, a report by Goldman Sachs estimates the machines are likely to substitute people in 5% to 15% of existing jobs in car manufacturing as well as in dangerous jobs, such as disaster rescue and nuclear reactor work. That demand is likely to push 1.1 million to 3.5 million units globally, according to the report.\n\nHumanoids have already begun taking their first steps into reality. Musk has said two Optimus robots are working at Tesla’s Fremont factory, and he expects a few thousand to be deployed by next year. Amazon (AMZN) has partnered with Oregon-based Agility to utilize its Digit robot at a test facility. Apptronik is working with Mercedes-Benz to integrate Apollo into its manufacturing line.\n\nTalla sees a humanoid future beyond industrial use. He expects androids to become as ubiquitous as smartphones and EVs, if companies are able to scale and bring costs down to $10,000 per machine.\n\n“It needs to be economical, it needs to be intelligent, and it needs to be safe,” he said. “If those three conditions are met, then there’s no reason why every home should not have at least one humanoid or more.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Potential of Huge Returns",
        "content": "I am fascinated by robots. From an investment standpoint, robotics looks to be the natural complement to AI’s advancement. Capable machinery powered by the latest artificial intelligence platform can help businesses perform complex mechanical tasks in manufacturing, healthcare, and other sectors, cutting down process times and increasing efficiency to its maximum. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are already popular in some sectors, so this might be a good time for other investors to shop around for robotics stocks to buy and hold.\n\nOf course, you wouldn’t want to buy just any old company, which is why I’ll screen the market for the best robotics stocks to buy, gauging them on their fundamentals and capacity for longevity. Remember, robotics is not a new industry, but recent advances in AI make it an increasingly attractive investment area.\n\nTo get my list, I screened companies that operate in the robotics industry or have robotics-related business segments using the following criteria:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDebt-to-equity ratio: 1.25 and below. The debt-to-equity ratio measures a company’s financial leverage. The lower the leverage ratio, the better it manages its obligations, Return-on-equity ratio: 15% and above. Return on equity measures how efficiently the company handles its capital to produce profits. Fifteen percent is considered a good level, so I scanned for companies with higher than that, Analyst rating: Buy or higher.\n\nI then sorted the list based on the highest to lowest ROE. Here are the results:\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeradyne (NASDAQ:TER) is the go-to name for automated test equipment used in industrial applications. The company’s core business specializes in the semiconductor market. Besides its testing expertise, the company offers other services like automation and robotics.\n\nTeradyne recently appointed James Davidson as its Chief AI Officer, aiming to support its vision to revolutionize the manufacturing industry by leveraging Davidson’s experience in both robotics and artificial intelligence. In addition, Teradyne has partnered with the AI powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to support the development of its automation capabilities.\n\nWhile Teradyne may have had a slower FY 2023 due to its revenue decline, its Robotics segment boasted 50% year-over-year growth in Q4 2023, highlighting its strong potential for a growing market segment.\n\nIn addition, revenue in Q2 2024 was up 7% year over year, surpassing its guidance. CEO Greg Smith emphasized its robotics sector, and the growing demand for AI has been a strong catalyst in its growth. With an ROE of 18.77% and an almost non-existent debt-to-equity ratio, the company boasts a strong proposition for long-term investors looking for robotics stocks to buy and hold. Even Wall Street’s strong buy consensus agrees with this.\n\nStory continues\n\nESAB Corporation (ESAB) a robot built in the essence of a human raising its hand to its chin implying deep thought. future tech stocks. AI stocks\n\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nESAB Corporation (NYSE:ESAB), the world leader in cutting, fabrication, and welding equipment, offers various industrial solutions to its customers, including robotics, gas control equipment, and digital solutions. The company operates in two main segments:\n\nEMEA & APAC: Focuses on operations in Europe, India, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific, Americas: Focuses on its North and South American operations.\n\nESAB has been experiencing moderate yet continuous revenue growth for several years. While earnings growth over the last three years has been flat, the company maintains a return on equity (ROE) of 17.49%. Its debt-to-equity ratio also stands at 0.59, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing debt.\n\nIn addition, President and CEO Shyam P. Kambeyanda has highlighted that the company’s drivers for growth and profitability come from its new innovative products and EBX initiatives. No wonder it boasts a strong buy consensus rating among nine analysts. With its strong commitment to growth and cash flow generation, it is a no-brainer to check out ESAB if you want to buy and hold robotics stocks.\n\nNovanta (NOVT) Blue \"buy now\" button on a keyboard with finger pressing down on it. French Election Stock Picks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Odua Images\n\nWhen it comes to robotics discussions, some might already know Novanta (NASDAQ:NOVT) due to its reputation in electronics, metrology, robotics, and automation. The company operates in three main segments:\n\nPrecision Medicine and Manufacturing: laser technology and optical engine products, Medical Solutions: medical-grade technologies and visualization solutions, Robotics and Automation: optical and inductive encoders, servo drives, precision motors, intelligent robotic end-of-arm technology solutions, etc.\n\nNovanta had a strong FY 2023, reaching a record revenue of $882 million, a 2.4% improvement over the previous year’s $861 million. However, its earnings per share decreased slightly from $2.06 to $2.02, due mostly to acquisitions.\n\n“Combined with continuing to institutionalize the Novanta Growth System deep into our Company’s culture,” said CEO and chair Matthijs Glastra, “our playbook will continue to deliver predictable, consistent, long-term growth and shareholder value.”\n\nNovanta’s debt-to-equity ratio is currently 0.75, and its return-to-equity ratio is 16.58%, highlighting its strong financial foundation and effective management. Wall Street consensus currently rates NOVT stock as a consensus buy. With its diverse product lineup and sound financials, Novanta is a strong contender for the best robotics stocks to buy today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nGOOG is an important part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Singer believes are in a bubble.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\n\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.  With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\n\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet’s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts’ forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)  is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\n\nConventum – Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google / YouTube, returned 20.8%. Although management reported good news – solid quarterly results, the expectation of margin expansion throughout 2024, as well as a maiden dividend (to add to its share repurchases) – we suspect the share price bounce was as much related to AI euphoria as it was to that positive news. From our perspective, the figures were largely as expected and there was no cause for us to change our assumptions nor estimates. Clearly Alphabet now trades at a larger premium to our valuation, but given the conservativeness of that valuation, in our view the premium is still not so much as to warrant selling. It represents 5.3% of the Fund.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Are Analysts Recommending NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Semiconductor Stock Despite Selloff?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the top semiconductor picks of Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn’t immediately evident from NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (“the Index”) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\n\nOur Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious “AI winner” due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Are Analysts Recommending Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) AI Semiconductor Stock Despite Selloff?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 124\n\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently increased its price target for AMD to $200 from $170.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore said while he likes AMD’s story, he sees “limited upward revision potential for AI from here and we move to EW, with a preference for NVDA and AVGO among large cap AI semis.”\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now  plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list Analysts are Recommending These 10 AI Semiconductor Stocks Despite Selloff.

        "title": "Move Over, Nvidia and Broadcom: Wall Street Has a New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock-Split Stock",
        "content": "For the last three decades, Wall Street and investors have pretty much always had a next-big-thing technology, innovation, or trend to latch onto. What's uncommon is for there to be two trends vying for attention at the same time, which is what's going on right now.\n\nSince 2023 began, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated Wall Street. The ability for software and systems to learn without human intervention gives AI a sky-high addressable market over the long run.\n\nBut we've also witnessed the return of stock-split euphoria. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event where a publicly traded company alters its share price and outstanding share count. These are purely cosmetic moves designed to make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or to increase a company's share price to ensure it meets the minimum continued listing standards of a major stock exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Stock splits have no effect on a company's market cap or its underlying operating performance.\n\nOver the last six months, more than a dozen high-profile, time-tested companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- all but one of which was of the forward-split variety. Investors tend to gravitate to companies enacting forward splits because they're being conducted from a position of operating strength.\n\nAlthough no stock splits have, arguably, been more anticipated this year than AI behemoths Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), another high-flying artificial intelligence stock is vying for its moment in the spotlight.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom have completed historic stock splits this year\n\nAlthough brand-name juggernauts Walmart and Chipotle Mexican Grill kicked off the stock-split party in 2024, the May 22 announcement from Nvidia that it would be completing its largest forward-stock split in history, 10-for-1, really excited current and prospective investors.\n\nRoughly two weeks after completing its split, which occurred after the close of trading on June 7, Nvidia's stock briefly topped $140 per share, giving the company a peak market value of $3.46 trillion. This combination of stock-split euphoria and having its hardware lead the AI revolution briefly allowed Nvidia to become the world's largest publicly traded company.\n\nNvidia has held a near-monopoly on the graphics processing units (GPUs) responsible for the split-second decision-making that's fueling AI-driven data centers. In 2023, Nvidia accounted for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped to data centers, and current demand for its superstar H100 GPU has handily overwhelmed supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough history would suggest that all next-big-thing innovations are destined for a bubble-bursting event -- which would undeniably hit Nvidia's stock hard -- Nvidia has ridden its compute advantages to enormous operating and stock-based gains.\n\nOn June 12, AI networking specialist Broadcom followed suit by announcing its own 10-for-1 forward split. This is Broadcom's first-ever stock split since Avago and Broadcom officially merged in early 2016. Shares began trading at a split-adjusted price on July 15.\n\nBroadcom has quickly embraced the interest and demand for AI-relevant networking solutions. Last year, it introduced its Jericho3-AI fabric, which is able to connect up to 32,000 high-powered GPUs. The company's solutions are designed to reduce tail latency and ensure that businesses are getting as much compute ability as possible out of their GPUs.\n\nHowever, Broadcom generates plenty of sales and operating cash flow beyond the AI arena. Its wireless chips and accessories are staples in next-generation smartphones. What's more, Broadcom provides an assortment of products for industrial automation and next-gen vehicles, as well as cybersecurity solutions.\n\nWhile Nvidia and Broadcom have had their moment in the sun, Wall Street's newest AI stock-split stock, which has seen its shares increase in value by 2,750% over the trailing-five-year period, is readying for its moment of fame. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeet Wall Street's newest AI-driven stock-split stock\n\nThe high-flying AI stock set to push Nvidia and Broadcom out of the way is none other than customizable rack server and storage specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nFollowing the closing bell on Aug. 6, Super Micro announced that its board had approved a historic 10-for-1 stock split. Similar to Broadcom, this represents Super Micro's first-ever split. With an effective date of Sept. 30, 2024, shares should open at closer to $51 (based on its closing price on Aug. 8) once trading commences on Oct. 1.\n\nJust as Nvidia's chips have become the \"brains\" of AI-accelerated data centers, Super Micro Computer has seemingly been the go-to choice among businesses for AI infrastructure. Net sales for the June-ended quarter catapulted to $5.31 billion, which is a cool 144% higher than the prior-year period. The wide-ranging expectation is that demand for the physical infrastructure needed to power AI-accelerated data centers isn't going to slow anytime soon.\n\nBut at the same time, the argument needs to be made that Super Micro Computer may have come a bit too far, too fast.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, every potential game-changing innovation, technology, and trend for three decades has endured an early stage bubble-bursting event. This is a roundabout way of saying that investors have a consistent habit of overestimating the uptake and utility of new innovations. Since most businesses lack a true game plan with AI, we're probably witnessing the next in a long line of early innings bubbles.\n\nSuper Micro Computer also has precedent with high-growth trends failing to pan out as predicted. During the mid-2010s, the company's stock rallied on the expectation that its infrastructure would be critical to the newfound cloud-computing boom. Ultimately, demand for customizable rack servers didn't meet lofty expectations and its stock retreated by roughly 75% over multiple years.\n\nSomething else to consider about Super Micro Computer is that it's highly dependent on Nvidia for its success. The company's rack servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 GPUs. If production capacity for the H100 remains constrained, Super Micro likely won't be able to satisfy all of its infrastructure orders.\n\nAlthough shares of Super Micro Computer appear cheap -- the company's forward price-to-earnings multiple is a mere 12 -- this valuation is based on near-flawless execution moving forward. If history tells us anything, it's that the ramp associated with new technologies and trends is rarely, if ever, perfect.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Jump Over 20% By the End of 2024 After Its Big Sell-Off",
        "content": "The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\n\nRegular viewers of ABC's Wide World of Sports heard the late Jim McKay utter those words for decades. While McKay referred to athletes, his phrase can also apply to stocks -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThroughout much of the past few years, Nvidia has enjoyed \"the thrill of victory.\" Its shares skyrocketed along with the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). More recently, though, Nvidia has tasted \"the agony of defeat\" somewhat with its stock sinking.\n\nHowever, I don't think Nvidia will have this taste in its mouth for long. I predict Nvidia stock will jump by more than 20% by the end of 2024 after its big sell-off.\n\nFactors behind Nvidia's steep decline\n\nBefore I explain the rationale behind my prediction, let's first look at the factors behind Nvidia's steep decline. Some are specific to the company but not all of them.\n\nIn July, Bloomberg News reported that the Biden administration was considering imposing further restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment to China. Former President Donald Trump also told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it. Both stories caused chip stocks to fall.\n\nDisappointing July employment numbers in a report released on Aug. 2 stoked fears of a potential U.S. recession. Nvidia's shares fell as this news weighed on the broader stock market.\n\nThe market was rattled even more by the Bank of Japan raising interest rates. This move had a global impact because some investors had borrowed money in Japan to take advantage of low rates and then invested the borrowed money in U.S. stocks (including Nvidia) in what's called a \"carry trade.\"\n\nAround the same time, news broke that Nvidia's launch of chips based on its new Blackwell architecture could be delayed by three months. The Information, a website focused on the technology sector, reported that Nvidia found a design flaw that caused the delay.\n\nHow Nvidia can rebound\n\nWhy do I predict Nvidia stock will rebound in the wake of all of this bad news? For one thing, the news isn't as bad as it might seem at first glance.\n\nSo far, the Biden administration hasn't placed any further restrictions on exports to China. It's unclear if Nvidia would be impacted even if changes are implemented. The disappointing July jobs report was followed by lower-than-expected weekly jobless claims a few days later, easing concerns about a recession.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analysts think that roughly 75% of the carry trades impacted by the rate hike in Japan have been unwound. In other words, the worst is over.\n\nStory continues\n\nAny delay in shipping the new Blackwell chips would hurt Nvidia's sales growth. The good news is that the impact would only be temporary.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia is scheduled to provide its fiscal 2025 Q2 update on Aug. 28. I expect the company will again handily beat Wall Street estimates. I also think it's likely that Nvidia will give a firm date for when Blackwell shipments will begin that isn't too far into the future. The Q2 update could (and I think will) clear the deck for Nvidia's shares to resume their upward climb.\n\nNvidia's guidance could also reassure investors. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms said in their recent quarterly updates that they plan to spend heavily on AI infrastructure. That should translate to higher sales for Nvidia.\n\nFinally, many analysts and economists expect the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. I do too. And I think it's quite possible this rate cut could be a catalyst for the stock market and help push Nvidia's shares higher.\n\nThe biggest threat to my prediction\n\nI'm assuming that the U.S. economy will remain relatively strong. But should the economy stumble (and especially if there are signs that a recession is beginning), all bets are off. If this happens, Nvidia stock probably won't rise 20% or more by year-end as I predict.\n\nHowever, the latest weekly jobless claims and the increased likelihood of rate cuts in the near future bolster my confidence. I stand by my prediction about Nvidia. We'll find out in a few months if I'm right.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on Super Micro Computer (SMCI) on ValueInvestorsClub by Motherlode. In this article we will summarize the bulls' thesis on SMCI. Super Micro Computer shares were trading at $69 when this thesis was published, vs. closing price of $624.65 on Aug 2. However, SMCI stock is down 30% over the last month. Should investors consider buying SMCI stock after the recent drop?\n\nA computer network engineering team setting up a server array in a data center.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, commonly known as Supermicro, has emerged as a leading stock in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The company specializes in high-performance, liquid-cooled servers for data centers, with about half of its revenue coming from dedicated AI servers. This focus has made Supermicro an ideal partner for Nvidia, granting them early access to Nvidia’s high-end data center GPUs and a competitive edge over traditional server companies like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).\n\nSupermicro’s growth has been impressive. Although the company faced pandemic-related disruptions and supply chain issues from fiscal 2019 to 2021, resulting in a sluggish compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 1%, it rebounded strongly. From fiscal 2021 to 2023, revenue increased at a CAGR of 42%, and earnings per share (EPS) surged at a CAGR of 134%, primarily driven by robust AI server sales.\n\nLooking forward, Supermicro’s growth prospects remain strong. Analysts project that from fiscal 2023 to 2026, the company’s revenue and EPS will grow at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. These growth rates are notable for a stock trading at just 27 times next year’s earnings. The global AI server market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029, according to Research and Markets.\n\nSupermicro’s bullish case centres on its early-mover advantage in the AI server market, increasing market share, and expanding partnerships beyond Nvidia to include AMD and Intel. Loop Capital, which co-managed a $1.7 billion senior unsecured convertible notes offering for Supermicro, is particularly optimistic. They believe Supermicro is well-positioned to benefit from the expanding AI market. Loop Capital's analysis suggests that if Supermicro meets Wall Street's expectations and maintains its valuation, its stock price could reach nearly $1,100 by early fiscal 2026. To hit Loop Capital’s high target of $1,500, the stock would need to trade at about 37 times forward earnings, which is reasonable for a high-growth AI stock.\n\nHowever, competition from Dell and HPE, which are also expanding their AI server businesses, could limit Supermicro’s growth and squeeze margins. Additionally, Supermicro’s partnership with Nvidia is not exclusive, and competitors are also seeking Nvidia’s data center GPUs. Broader risks include potential cooling of the AI market due to tighter regulations, geopolitical tensions, and export curbs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these risks, Supermicro’s long-term outlook appears promising. If the company maintains its lead in liquid-cooled, high-end servers and continues to expand its share of the AI server market, it could exceed even the most optimistic price targets over time. While investors should be prepared for volatility, Supermicro’s strong growth rates and strategic partnerships make it a compelling investment in the rapidly expanding AI sector.\n\nSMCI is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 35 hedge fund portfolios held SMCI at the end of the first quarter which was 41 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Good Humanoid Robot Stock According to Morgan Stanley?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other humanoid robot stocks.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that 2024 is the year of technology. Artificial intelligence, despite its biggest detractors claims, has managed to persist, and in its wake, it has spurred new life into a variety of industries.\n\nOne such industry is robotics. Like artificial intelligence, robots have typically been thought to lie in the domain of science fiction. And like AI, they're also becoming a reality faster than we can comprehend. One of the biggest advancements in robotics has been made by the private company Boston Dynamics, whose robot dogs are used by a lot of industrial customers, including SpaceX.\n\nHowever, while Boston Dynamics' robot dogs are impressive, humanoid robots, or those that look like humans and perform mechanical functions like humans are further in the domain of science fiction. These robots are popularized through movies such as. the Terminator series and iRobot, are in fact, a multi trillion dollar opportunity if we're to believe research from Wall Street analysts.\n\nA research report by Morgan Stanley that takes one of the most optimistic takes on humanoid robots speculates that by 2030, the humanoid population will sit at a comfortable 40,000. If this was impressive, the estimates for 2040 and 2050 are not only stunning but also orders of magnitude higher. By 2040 and 2050, the humanoid population could sit at an unbelievable 8 million and 63 million, respectively - or higher than 27 out of the 50 most populous countries in the world in 2024. In terms of monetary figures, the wage impact of the 8 million population is estimated to sit at a cool $357 billion, while the impact of the 63 million robots is $3 trillion.\n\nThis research builds on the total addressable markets for industries that are an indispensable part of the world but suffer from low labor due to low funding and wages and dangerous, repetitive, and boring tasks. A total of 21 such industries are identified, and they are divided into three tiers. The first tier, or Tier 1, is expected to see humanoid adoption as soon as 2028. In terms of the total adoption percentage, i.e. the number of roles in these industries that could be filled by humanoid robots, the top four industries are construction and extraction, production, farming, fishing, and forestry, and building and grounds clearing maintenance.\n\nThe risky industries highlighted above have an adoption potential of 70%, 68%, 67%, and 67%, respectively. The highest potential of the monetary impact is also from the Tier 1 industries, and it's quite low if we're to look at the 'near term.' For the years 2030, 2032, 2034, 2036, and 2038, the wage impacts sit at $1 billion, $6 billion, $19 billion, $60 billion, and $158 billion, respectively for the Tier 1 industries. The impact for Tier 2 industries starts in 2040, with Tier 4 beginning its contribution in 2044. Yet, while their adoption might be in the future, the riskiest of use cases, i.e. space exploration, has already seen a humanoid robot in the form of NASA's Robonaut occupy the International Space Station (ISS) from 2011 to 2018. NASA's Robonaut first made its way to space in 2011, and it was upgraded to Robonaut 2 in 2014 which was brought back to Earth in 2018.\n\nOne industry that MS is quite optimistic about when it comes to humanoids is social care. It believes that social care \"is arguably the world’s largest TAM by the end of the century, but one that suffers from restrictive funding creating a lack of incentivisation to recruit or re-skill workers. Humanoids will face many challenges. And while they may not be the best solution, they are an increasingly necessary solution for a world facing immense longevity challenges.\" Yet, the demand for these challenges could take its time to materialize. \"Understanding the humanoid theme requires a multi-sector approach and a long term time horizon\" cautions MS, but it wants investors to be ready to pounce on \" an extraordinary number of developments and milestones over the next 6 to 12 months\" even though the \"he path to commercialization at scale may take decades to fully play out.\"\n\nTalking numbers, there are a plethora of estimates floating around that wager a guess at the potential value of the humanoid robot industry. One estimate comes from no one else than the electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. Musk's love of everything technology has made him who he is today, and it also means that he is often at the leading edge of leading technologies,  whether they are artificial intelligence, brain implants, or humanoid robots.\n\nHis most recent comments about humanoid robots came during his car company's annual shareholder meeting. At the event, the executive shared that by selling these robots, his company could become worth a whopping $25 trillion at an unspecified time in the future. Musk's robot is called Optimus, and his firm also believes that while the robot's initial bill of materials (BOM) can range between $50,000 to $60,000, these costs can be brought down to enable his company to sell $1 trillion worth of robots a year.\n\nMusk isn't the only one who is convinced of the potential offered by humanoid robots. Research from more Wall Street analysts estimates that the market could be worth $38 billion by 2035. Mind you, this is the Goldman analysts' base case model which estimates unit shipments of 1.4 million. The bear case, which sees shipments cut in half to 703 million suggests a value of $19 billion by 2035, while the bull case and the blue sky scenario estimate shipments of 6.5 million and 11.6 million units, respectively. Extrapolating from a $38 billion valuation that stems from 1.4 million units, this could mean that the very best scenario for the humanoid robot market leads to a value of $315 billion. At the heart of this optimism are AI and dropping BOM costs.\n\nAccording to the analysts, the BOM for making humanoid robots has dropped by a strong 40% between 2023 and 2024 to range between $30,000 to $150,000 depending on the specifications. This reduction is primarily \"driven by the availability of cheaper components with a broader scope of supply chain options from the mere existence in labs previously, optimization in design and manufacturing technique (e.g. cost for T-screw dropped significantly by shifting from electric discharge machining to mechanical machining.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy, we started with Morgan Stanley's Humanoid 66 stock list. This list is divided into three categories, humanoid enablers and beneficiaries, enablers, and beneficiaries. Since the enablers are the ones that will directly benefit in terms of tangible revenues from potential growth in the humanoid industry, we selected the top 15 stocks in the first two categories.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q1 2024: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes and sells GPUs that are used to compute artificial intelligence workloads. These include machine learning, a key arm of AI that is used in vision processing. Vision processing is the bedrock of humanoid robots since it allows them to perceive their environment and act accordingly. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) enjoys a considerable competitive moat since its products are the industry leaders in terms of performance. It also benefits from tight software integration through its CUDA software which allows users to control GPU functions - which can be customized for humanoids. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also offers microservices and orchestration services for humanoid robots, with CEO Jensen Huang already having claimed that the \"next wave of AI is robotics.\"\n\nAristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"Nvidia contributed to portfolio performance in the second quarter as investors continued to view positively the new product roadmap for the rest of the year. The company sees accelerating demand for its GPU semiconductors from hyperscalers and enterprises. Nvidia’s GPU semiconductors continue to be the industry-leading building blocks of the accelerated computing data center architecture to drive AI compute and applications.\"\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 7th on our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The 'G' in ESG is gaining more shareholder love than the 'E' or 'S'",
        "content": "Shareholders asked to approve new ESG policies are warming up to the \"G\" even as they continue withholding support for the \"E\" and \"S.\"\n\n\"G\" refers to corporate “governance\" changes, and such proposals received considerably more shareholder support this year than proposals targeting environmental (E) or social (S) changes, according to an analysis of ISS-Corporate data conducted by law firm Freshfields.\n\nOf the 154 so-called governance proposals that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14, 38 were successful, according to the analysis.\n\nMost that passed called for the elimination of supermajority vote requirements for significant company actions, including at California chip maker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nOther successful proposals required that all directors stand for reelection each year or empowered shareholders to call special meetings. A Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat 25% success rate is considerably higher than E and S proposals that would force companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adopt more sustainable supply chain practices, and adopt diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) targets.\n\nJust two environmentally focused proposals received majority shareholder backing during the same period measured by Freshfields.\n\nThe support was even thinner for social proposals. Just one passed, requiring glucose monitoring medical device company DexCom (DXCM) to report its political contributions. That measure received a 52% majority.\n\nNo 'backlash'\n\nOne possible reason for this divergence is that the G in ESG does not attract the same level of political scrutiny as the E or the S.\n\n\"These types of proposals are not considered overly prescriptive on companies and don’t play into any of the backlash to ESG more generally we have seen recently, meaning they tend to have a broader base of support,” said Michael Arnold, a corporate governance attorney with Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP.\n\nBoth ESG and DEI have been hot-button issues during the 2024 presidential campaign. Former President Donald Trump has promised to banish ESG-minded retirement account investments \"forever,\" while a top Trump ally has called DEI \"bigotry\" against white men.\n\nRepublican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.\n\nThis anti-ESG and anti-DEI momentum has forced some companies to peel back some of their existing policies, let alone adopt new ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder pressure from shareholders, rural retailer Tractor Supply in June announced that it would retire its DEI goals. A Tractor Supply store sign in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTractor maker John Deere made a similar announcement in July, stating that it would continue to track workforce diversity but end participation in cultural- and social awareness-focused events.\n\nBut the fact that many E and S proposals were voted down this year may not signal less shareholder interest, according to Freshfields’ Pam Marcogliese.\n\nMarcogliese instead suggests that this year's votes could indicate that shareholders have grown more satisfied with companies’ ESG progress and that investors see these latest proposals as too incremental to make a difference. A John Deere 5115 ML tractor in Brentwood, Calif. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)\n\n\"Investors maybe don't really think it's worth it because that type of proposal is more about micromanaging the company, rather than really providing more helpful data,\" Marcogliese said.\n\nAnd some of the environmental proposals this season failed only by slim margins. Proposals at Denny’s (DENN), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), and Dine Brands (DIN) came close to receiving majority support, with yes votes hovering around 40%.\n\nIt should also be noted that there were 51 shareholder proposals that actually opposed companies’ existing DEI efforts — and none of those passed, either.\n\n'Are supermajority votes headed for extinction?'\n\nCertainly, shareholders were much more comfortable signing off on certain governance changes.\n\nThere were 252 such proposals and 38 were successful out of the 154 that went to a vote between Jan. 1 and June 14. Those figures exclude proposals concerning executive compensation.\n\nThat means that 15% of all governance proposals filed were adopted, up from 7% in 2023, according to Freshfields.\n\nFor companies included in the Russell 3000, ISS-Corporate said the figure was even higher — at 20% of all proposals filed.\n\nThe most popular change was to reduce supermajority vote requirements and replace them with simple majority voting standards — a move designed to enhance the rights of shareholders. This was the proposal approved at Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nSupermajority vote requirements can make it more challenging to amend a company’s bylaws or charters, making it more difficult to get changes approved.\n\nIn a recent report — titled \"Are supermajority votes headed for extinction?\" — ISS cited a Tesla (TSLA) vote in 2019 as one example of how supermajority policies can slow things down.\n\nThat year proposals designed to improve governance practices at the electric vehicle maker received robust support among votes cast, according to ISS, but failed because just 52% of the company’s share capital was represented — as opposed to two-thirds. A Tesla logo. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The percentage of S&P 500 companies still employing supermajority rules has declined to just over one third, meaning those retaining the practice increasingly look like outliers and may face more scrutiny and pressure to change,\" ISS said in its report.\n\nNot all governance proposals did well this year, however. One notable outlier came with attempts to split the CEO and board chair positions, according to the Freshfields analysis.\n\nOf the 44 such proposals, zero passed.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Dominating the Artificial Intelligence Chip Market, but Apple Has Been Securing Supply From Another Tech Giant",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI.\n\nBut given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones.\n\nApple has bought chips from Alphabet\n\nOne of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers.\"\n\nCould more competition be on the way?\n\nAlphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into.\n\nThe courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business.\n\nBeyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future.\n\nShould Nvidia investors be worried?\n\nNvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late.\n\nIs Nvidia's stock still a buy?\n\nNvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight.\n\nNvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before August 28? Here's What the Evidence Suggests.",
        "content": "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is ongoing, but some investors fear the trend is getting a little long in the tooth. Fears about the economy and weakness in AI stocks helped push the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory earlier this month, and with valuations stretched, some believe there could be further declines ahead.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the poster child for the generative AI trend. When the company reports its results later this month, it's not hyperbole to suggest that Wall Street will be sitting on the edge of its seat, hoping to gain insight into the state of AI adoption.\n\nNvidia's sales have skyrocketed since the start of 2023, driving the stock up 619% (as of this writing), though it's currently more than 22% off its high.\n\nWith so much riding on Nvidia's quarterly results, investors are wondering whether the recent stock price decline represents a buying opportunity ahead of the company's highly anticipated financial report. Let's review the available evidence. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnecdotal data is strong\n\nThe biggest driver for Nvidia over the past 18 months has been the rapid adoption of generative AI by cloud infrastructure providers best positioned to monetize AI. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for these applications.\n\nAs a result, cloud infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud, have been upgrading their data centers to provide the computational horsepower needed to run AI. Even Meta Platforms has jumped on the bandwagon, creating one of the leading large language models (LLMs) so it can profit from AI.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's AI-centric processors remains robust among the cloud leaders, and each has highlighted plans for higher capex spending to support their AI aspirations. This bodes well for Nvidia in the current quarter.\n\nRivals and partners are reporting robust sales\n\nThere's further evidence that suggests Nvidia's results will be robust.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), otherwise known as AMD, is one of Nvidia's biggest rivals in the GPU space. The company reported its second-quarter results late last month, and the strength of its AI-related sales caught many market watchers off guard. While revenue grew 9% year over year and beat expectations, its data center sales surged to a record $2.58 billion, up 115%, driven higher by soaring demand for AI.\n\nArm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) creates the CPU cores found in many of Nvidia's AI processors, and its results were similarly upbeat. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended June 30), Arm reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record results. The company generated record revenue of $939 million, up 39% year over year, the result of record license revenue driven by \"the proliferation of AI.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) supplies server and storage solutions featuring next-generation AI processors from Nvidia and others. For the company's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), revenue of $5.3 billion grew 143% year over year and 38% quarter over quarter. Despite its parabolic growth rate, management noted Supermicro continued to be hamstrung by short-term \"supply chain bottlenecks.\"\n\nThe thread that runs through these AI players is that demand remained strong in the most recent quarter, driven by the secular tailwind of AI. This suggests Nvidia's sales should be similarly robust.\n\nStock splits are bullish\n\nThere are other reasons to believe Nvidia stock could have additional upside from here. Research by analysts at Bank of America shows that in the 12 months following a stock-split announcement, stock-split stocks gained 25%, on average, compared to just 12% for the S&P 500.\n\nSince Nvidia announced its stock split on May 22, the stock has actually fallen 19% (as of this writing), as fears regarding the state of the economy overshadowed the tailwinds of AI. If history is any indicator, Nvidia still has plenty of double-digit upside potential ahead.\n\nIs the stock a buy before August 28?\n\nFor investors looking to make a fast buck, Nvidia is likely not the stock for you. As the recent stock chart shows, Nvidia has been -- and will continue to be -- a volatile stock. While investors who bought last year are likely sitting on triple-digit gains, those who bought last month could be down more than 22%. This helps to illustrate a timeless investing truth: It's best to buy shares in the best companies you can find and hold them for three to five years, as you're less likely to suffer the impact of short-term volatility.\n\nFor those wondering whether Nvidia stock will go up or down after its upcoming financial report, your guess is as good as mine. I sent my crystal ball to the shop years ago, but it still hasn't come back. Furthermore, anyone who professes to know what will happen in the days or weeks that follow is being less than truthful.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess -- and that's all it would be -- I suspect Nvidia will report another quarter of record sales. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of $28.52 billion, slightly ahead of Nvidia's guidance of $28 billion. However, much of how the stock price reacts in the wake of the report will depend on the company's profitability and Nvidia's forward-looking guidance.\n\nIt's important to take a step back and look at the big picture. Nvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for AI processing, and while there's always the threat of competition, no heir apparent has emerged. Most experts believe it's still early innings for generative AI as adoption continues to ramp up. Even the most conservative estimates suggest that generative AI will be a trillion-dollar market, with some forecasts multitudes higher.\n\nNvidia stock trades at a premium of 38 times earnings (as of this writing), but the company's triple-digit growth, industry-leading position, and long track record show that it's worth every penny.\n\nMy advice to you is this: If you believe -- like I do -- that AI has a long way to go and Nvidia will maintain its dominance in the market, then buy Nvidia stock and hold on for dear life.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Intel, SMCI hit by downgrades; Micron still top semis pick",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nNew Street ups Nvidia to Buy, says recent pullback presents opportunity to add exposure\n\nNew Street Research has upgraded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to a Buy rating with a target price of $120 this week. The move comes following a significant decline in the chipmaker’s stock since its June peak, leading Nvidia to underperform other semiconductor stocks linked to data center AI.\n\n“We find the correction healthy overall, recognize some limited and tactical headwinds specific to Nvidia, but overall see the stock moves as an opportunity to gain more exposure,” analysts said.\n\nThe recent dip in Nvidia's shares has been partially attributed to reports of a potential three-month delay in the release of its Blackwell chip due to design flaws. This delay could push volume shipments to Q1 2025.\n\nBlackwell’s design features two large dies interconnected at 10TB/s using TSMC’s CoWoS-L packaging technology, which has faced ramp-up challenges and may require redesign.\n\nTo address this delay, Nvidia might extend the lifecycle of its Hopper chip, which uses the more mature CoWoS-S packaging and can be produced more efficiently. Also, Nvidia could introduce a simplified version of the Blackwell chip with a single die, New Street explains.\n\n“While it would have lower performance than the dual-die Blackwell SKUs, it would still be an uplift vs. Hopper,” analysts noted.\n\nNew Street also maintains a positive outlook on Nvidia’s market dominance in the data center XPU space.\n\n\"We see in-house XPUs doing well against GPUs and being deployed in millions across gigantic in-house captive markets,\" though they acknowledge AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as a potential challenger.\n\nMoreover, expectations for hyperscaler capex in 2025 have risen, now forecasting 13% growth, with AI infrastructure capex projected to grow by at least 30%. This supports the firm’s forecast that AI semiconductor spending could increase by 50% annually.\n\n‘Distant 3rd in merchant AI:’ Mizhuo downgrades Intel stock\n\nMizuho analysts on Wednesday downgraded Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Outperform to Neutral and adjusted their price target to $22 from $36.\n\nThe investment bank initially upgraded Intel in November 2023, driven by expectations of strong AI momentum and new products boosting PC and data center traction. However, nine months later, the outlook has changed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We were wrong—INTC has continued to lag its peers and is losing share in all key markets AI/DC/PC through 2025E,” analysts wrote. “We see INTC headwinds continuing, with execution risks on its product portfolio, and we're downgrading INTC to Neutral.\"\n\nThe technology gap between Intel and its competitors has widened, and while there is long-term potential for foundry and 18A tailwinds, regaining lost leadership is likely to be challenging, Mizuho notes.\n\nDespite launching new products in Server (Sierra Forest/Granite Rapids), AI (Gaudi 3), and PC (Meteor Lake), Intel is losing market share in PCs and data centers, remains “a distant 3rd in merchant AI.” Mizuho also cited internal challenges, including headcount reductions that could impact morale and execution.\n\nThe decision to cut dividends has further weighed on investor sentiment toward the stock, analysts pointed out.\n\nBofa cuts SMCI stock to Neutral amid margin headwinds\n\nEarlier in the week, Bank of America analysts cut their rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock to Neutral from Buy following the company's report of worse-than-expected margins for the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nAlthough Q4 revenue met both the firm's and street estimates, the gross margin of 11.3% fell significantly short of the anticipated 13.6%.\n\nSMCI stock fell 20% on Wednesday.\n\nThe data center company's revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 exceeded expectations, and its full fiscal 2025 revenue projection of $28 billion topped the consensus estimate of $23.8 billion.\n\nHowever, BofA noted that Super Micro's gross margin is expected to gradually return to its typical range of 14-17% by the end of fiscal 2025, assuming improvements in manufacturing efficiencies, a better customer mix, and the launch of new platforms.\n\n“While the long-term benefit from AI remains intact, we move to a Neutral rating, from Buy, as we see the next several quarters remaining margin challenged as SMCI navigates a competitive pricing environment, delayed shipment of Blackwell GPU systems that require liquid-cooled racks (higher margin), and ongoing issues with component availability.”\n\nReflecting these headwinds, they also lowered their price objective for Super Micro Computer from $1,090 to $700, aligning with the broader sector trend where valuation multiples have seen a notable decline.\n\nWedbush: Palantir’s collab with Microsoft ‘a launching pad for the AIP story’\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have announced a partnership this week to develop an integrated technology suite designed for the U.S. Defense and Intelligence Community.\n\nThis collaboration will leverage Palantir's AI-powered platforms within Microsoft's government and classified clouds, enabling secure cloud, AI, and analytics capabilities.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Palantir will deploy its full product suite, including Foundry, Gotham, Apollo, and AIP, on Microsoft's cloud platforms. This will allow government agencies to build AI tools for operational and logistical purposes, with hands-on experiences to test the technology.\n\nAlso, Palantir will integrate Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service into secure environments, combining cloud computing with advanced language models to support AI-driven operations in defense and intelligence.\n\n“With this marquee deal solidified and MSFT leveraging PLTR for AI and LLM capabilities to the US government, the company can now increase the pace of AI implementation while PLTR continues to accelerate AIP adoption within the federal sector,” Wedbush analysts commented.\n\n“We believe this will be a launching pad for the PLTR AIP story to hit the DOD (Department of Defense) and broader Beltway ecosystem over the next 12 to 18 months,” they added.\n\nCiti reiterates Micron as Top Pick on strong DRAM outlook\n\nSemiconductor stocks have seen a sharp decline recently, driven by macroeconomic challenges and disappointing earnings that fell short of high expectations. The downturn has been linked to slower-than-anticipated replenishment of analog inventories and potential risks from the automotive sector, which accounts for 14% of semiconductor demand.\n\nHowever, analysts at Citi remain optimistic about the sector, stressing that \"the main reasons we are positive – AI and memory strength – remain intact.\"\n\nDespite the recent drop, Citi continues to favor Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) as their top pick within the industry. They believe that \"it’s time to double down as the DRAM upturn should persist given reduced capacity and DRAM pricing in 3Q24 is better than expected.\"\n\nThe DRAM market is showing signs of improvement, with strong performances from major players like Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix.\n\nCiti analysts have revised their forecast for 2024 DRAM pricing, now expecting a 62% year-over-year increase, up from their previous estimate of 53%. This adjustment is attributed to limited supply growth and a shift by memory makers towards high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nWhile there are weaknesses in the automotive and industrial sectors, the demand from the largest end markets – PCs, handsets, and servers, which collectively represent 61% of semiconductor demand – remains relatively strong.\n\nMicron has reported that inventory levels in the traditional data center market improved during the first half of 2024 and anticipates further growth in the second half.\n\nCiti analysts have also indicated that they \"expect upside to guidance when Micron reports earnings in September.”\n\nMicron saw its shares slump more than 30% over the past month.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Intel, SMCI hit by downgrades; Micron still top semis pick\n\nDisney unveils 'Avatar' 'Indiana Jones,' 'Encanto' and 'Monsters, Inc' attractions\n\nGPS spoofers 'hack time' on commercial airlines, researchers say\n\nView comments",

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This AI Stock Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\n\nCEO Says AI is \"Gonna Keep Providing Value\"\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\n\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\n\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\n\nWest Coast's Smartphone Giant: AI Stock or Not?\n\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\n\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today. Our list includes some of the best AI stocks to buy, according to analysts, and some of the companies offering the top AI SEO tools in 2024 as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected AI stocks that made the top AI stocks lists of various financial news reporters, such as Forbes, Motley Fool, Nasdaq, US News, and NerdWallet. We then shortlisted and ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. The company is well known for its graphics cards and microchips for autonomous driving vehicles and AI applications. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) exposure to the AI space is one of the main reasons behind the company's stellar performance over the past several years, according to US News. Additionally, Nasdaq estimates that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) holds about 70% to 95% of the AI chip market. As such, this is a stock worth picking up, especially in light of its evident domination of the AI space today.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 186 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $48.3 billion.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to financial media. You can visit 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Mediato see the other artificial intelligence stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential for NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar as Much as 204% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "One of the most intriguing developments for investors over the past few years is the return to popularity of stock splits. While the practice was commonplace in the late 1990s, it had fallen out of favor but has enjoyed a resurgence over the past several years. This corporate action is usually taken in response to years of strong operating and financial results, which ultimately drive a thriving stock price.\n\nHistory suggests that top-performing businesses tend to continue firing on all cylinders. Companies that conduct forward stock splits generate share price increases of 25%, on average, in the year following the announcement, compared with average gains of 12% for the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard.\n\nHere are three stock-split stocks with room to run, according to certain Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom: Implied upside 76%\n\nThe first stock-split stock with a lot of potential upside growth is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). The company occupies an enviable position in technology circles, supplying a wide range of software, semiconductor, and security offerings spanning the cable, broadband, mobile, and data center spaces. Broadcom says that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology,\" giving it a critical position in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nRecent results show that business is booming. In the second quarter, revenue of $12.5 billion climbed 43% year over year, fueling adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $10.96, which grew 6%. It's worth noting the recent acquisition of VMWare is weighing on the company's profit margin, which management expects to normalize by 2025. The company expects its strong growth to continue, raising its full-year revenue forecast to $51 billion, which would represent growth of 42%.\n\nIts history of execution and robust growth led to Broadcom's 10-for-1 stock split, which took place in mid-July. Despite gains of 152% since early last year, many on Wall Street remain incredibly bullish. Just ahead of the split last month, Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating and boosted his price target to a split-adjusted $240, which represents a potential upside for investors of 76% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes the accelerating adoption of generative AI will fuel greater sales of AI-related hardware, including application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), networking, and switching chips. He also expects the integration of VMWare will begin to make a meaningful contribution.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe's not alone in his bullish take on Broadcom. Of the 38 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in July, 33 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 99%\n\nThe second stock-split stock with a boatload of potential is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company is the leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in video games, cloud computing, and data center operations. This helped Nvidia quickly dominate the market for the chips used for generative AI, which supercharged its sales, as these GPUs provide the computational horsepower needed for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), Nvidia generated record revenue of $26 billion, up a whopping 262% year over year, resulting in diluted EPS of $5.98, which surged 629%. The results were driven by the data center segment -- which includes AI processors -- as revenue for the segment soared 427% to $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia's blockbuster results have propelled its stock price up 600% since the start of 2023, leading to its high-profile 10-for-1 stock split in June. However, some on Wall Street believe there's much more to come. Mosesmann has a buy rating on Nvidia and a Street-high price target of $200, which represents a potential upside of 99% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes that many of his colleagues fail to grasp the importance of the software integrated with Nvidia's AI processors, giving it a serious competitive edge. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHe isn't the only one who believes there's much more to come. Of the 58 analysts who covered the stock in June, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside 204%\n\nThe last of our trio of stock split stocks with plenty of room to run is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro. The company has been supplying custom servers to the tech industry for more than 30 years. Supermicro's building-block approach to rack-scale servers with direct liquid cooling technology is a perfect fit for the rigors of AI processing, as is the company's legendary focus on energy efficiency.\n\nSupermicro has established strong working relationships with all the biggest chipmakers, ensuring it can get its hands on the most in-demand processors, including those from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel.\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended June 30), Supermicro generated record revenue of $5.3 billion, up 143% year over year and 38% quarter over quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.25, up 78%.\n\nWhile some investors were concerned about the company's declining profit margin, CEO Charles Liang cited a bottleneck involving some server components, which pushed some deals into the next quarter. This, in turn, altered the product mix to include more lower-margin sales. He expects a rebound in the coming quarters.\n\nSupermicro's robust results since early last year have driven stock price gains of 516%, leading the company to announce a 10-for-1 stock split just this week. Some on Wall Street believe this is just the beginning. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a buy rating on the shares and a Street-high price target of $1,500. That represents a potential upside of 204% compared to Wednesday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst believes investors continue to underestimate Supermicro's sales potential, suggesting it can deliver a revenue run rate of $40 billion during fiscal 2026, up from less than $15 billion to close out fiscal 2024. Management is forecasting a similar performance, guiding for net sales of roughly $28 billion at the midpoint of its guidance for fiscal 2025.\n\nWall Street seems to agree. Of the 17 analysts who offered an opinion in July, 12 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nA note on valuation\n\nEach of these stock-split stocks has a long runway ahead, yet despite their prospects, remain attractively priced. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Supermicro are currently trading for 36 times, 29 times, and 14 times forward earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27 for the S&P 500. While two of the three fetch a slight premium compared to the broader market, their track record of business and performance, blistering stock price gains, and solid future potential make them worth every penny.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Navellier & Associates.In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks approved by Navellier & Associates.\n\nFounded in 1987 by growth analyst Louis Navellier, Navellier & Associates is an independent firm based in Reno, Nevada. Navellier & Associates specializes in identifying market inefficiencies to find top-growth stocks through a disciplined quantitative and fundamental analysis system. With over 30 years of experience, they offer customized portfolio strategies for individual investors to maximize returns while managing risk. Unlike competitors who mimic indexes, Navellier aims to outperform them, resulting in low correlation with benchmarks and increased diversification.\n\nLouis Navellier is the Founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Investment Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer of Navellier & Associates, Inc. With decades of experience applying academic techniques to real market scenarios, he advocates for disciplined quantitative analysis to identify stocks that can outperform the market. His approach involves a rigorous three-step process: quantitative analysis, fundamental analysis, and optimization of selected securities for portfolio inclusion. This approach has been used by the firm where they employ a highly disciplined, bottom-up stock-selection process for most portfolios. First, they screen market and stock statistics to measure reward (alpha) and risk (standard deviation), selecting stocks in the top percentiles. Next, they further screen the top-ranked stocks for high-profit margins, strong earnings growth, and reasonable price/earnings ratios based on future earnings. Finally, a proprietary optimization model maximizes portfolio alpha while minimizing standard deviation, creating well-diversified portfolios across various sectors and industries.\n\nSince 1980, he has shared his insights through the MPT Review, a stock advisory newsletter. Since 1987, he has actively managed individual portfolios, mutual funds, and institutional portfolios. Known for his charismatic leadership, Louis Navellier has been featured extensively in international media, including CNBC, Bloomberg, The Nightly Business Report, and Wall Street Week. His insights have also been highlighted in Barron’s, Forbes, Fortune, Investor’s Business Daily, Money, Smart Money, and The Wall Street Journal. He has been profiled in books such as Kenneth A. Stern’s \"Secrets of the Investment All-Stars\" and Alan R. Ackerman’s \"Investing Under Fire.\" Mr. Navellier earned his B.S. in business administration in 1978 and his M.B.A. in finance in 1979 from California State University – Hayward.\n\nStory continues\n\nNavellier & Associates is a well-known advisory firm with 1,314 clients and manages assets worth $743,578,818, as reported in their Form ADV from March 2024.

This investment makes up 6.58% of Navellier & Associates' portfolio. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), which are crucial for AI and machine learning. Additionally, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding into new markets such as data centers, automotive technology, and edge computing, which helps reduce risk and opens up more revenue opportunities.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s opportunity is huge, as seen with AI startup CoreWeave, which recently hit a $19 billion valuation due to its use of NVIDIA GPUs. As reported by CNBC, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) controls 80% of the AI chip market, potentially translating to $1.8 trillion in sales with high profit margins. For fiscal year 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is projected to generate $31.5 billion in revenue, up from $26.9 billion the previous year, thanks to strong demand for its GPUs in AI and data centers. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s earnings per share (EPS) are expected to increase to $10.15, from $8.73 last year, and its gross margins are also expected to stay high at around 66%.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“In the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn’t immediately evident from NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (“the Index”) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\n\nOur Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious “AI winner” due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating…” (Click here to rad the full text)\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Navellier & Associates.

(NASDAQ:SMCI)\n\nNavellier & Associates' Stake Value: $42,017,248\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35\n\nSecuring the 2nd spot in Navellier & Associates' top 10 stock picks is Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) specializes in high-performance computing solutions, which are increasingly in demand due to the growth of data centers, cloud computing, and AI. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is recognized for its innovative products, including servers and storage systems. Recently, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) reported a 46% increase in revenue and a 65% rise in EPS over the past year. This strong revenue growth is largely driven by the rising need for AI and data center solutions.\n\nAnalyst Mike Zaccardi has a hold rating on Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). After a strong start to 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has stabilized and is now near a fair price. Given the potential for seasonal downturns and a neutral chart, he expects the stock to remain at its current levels for the next few months. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is expected to report an earnings per share (EPS) of $3.87 for fiscal year 2024, up significantly from $2.46 the previous year. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, Navellier & Associates held 41,600 shares of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), valued at $42,017,248. This investment made up 5.17% of their total portfolio, according to regulatory filings.\n\nThe Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund stated the following regarding Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We are benchmark-agnostic, so we spend our time researching current or potential EGCs, not analyzing indexes. However, this quarter there was inescapable attention on one AI-related company, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), which makes servers that hold NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) graphics processing units. Pundits wondered if Super Micro was the next AI “meme stock” set to soar like Nvidia. Super Micro’s stock price was up 255% in the first quarter and indeed is up a jaw-dropping 848% in the last year. Importantly, Super Micro is in the Russell 2000® Growth index, and alone accounted for over a third, or 2.82%, of the index’s 7.58% total return this quarter. However, Super Micro is not a company we could have ever owned. The company generated more than $7 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year, far above our current maximum revenue threshold. In fact, when the company came public in March 2007, it was already too large for our portfolio. Now, the company is so large that it moved into the S&P 500 index at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, not owning Super Micro was the largest detractor to our performance versus the index this quarter, comprising more than one-third of our underperformance. This, to us, is a reminder why an index is not always an accurate gauge of our short-term performance.”\n\nOverall SMCI ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Navellier & Associates.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD): I ‘Wish’ I Could Buy More",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks as Markets Rebound. Since Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the markets followed by a major selloff on Monday, saying we can “fret” about the interest rates, jobs market or mortgage rates, or we can just buy the stocks of “tremendous” companies and hold on to them.\n\n“Stock prices have become so dependent on the macro, the carry trade, the Fed chatter, that it’s impossible to give you a pat answer even as I’ve told you over and over again that corporate America is doing much better than anyone would expect at this point in the cycle,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer lamented yet again that people believe a 25bps decline in interest rates could somehow “motivate” people to increase spending and on these hopes they often buy “phony” ETFs.\n\nCramer also said that the Fed won’t begin to cut rates until it sees consumers “rebelling” against higher prices forcing companies to roll back price increases to pre-COVID levels. Jim Cramer believes we now have an “empowered consumer” who is willing to make choices and choose options that are cheaper and better.” He said that during the pandemic, amid higher liquidity, people were willing to accept higher prices, but not anymore.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Talking About Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Stock as Markets Rebound?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 124\n\nJim Cramer is extremely bullish on AMD, saying in a latest program that he “wishes” he’d be able to buy more AMD shares but said he’s “restricted” for his charitable trust.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  But Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)'s  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% year over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nMeridian Contrarian Fund stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor chip maker specializing in central processing units (CPUs), which are considered the core component of most computing devices, and graphics processing units (GPUs), which accelerate operations running on CPUs. We invested in 2018 when it was a mid-cap value stock plagued by many years of underperformance due to lagging technology and lost market hi share versus competitors Intel and Nvidia. Our research identified that changes and investments made by current management under CEO Lisa Su had, over several years, finally resulted in compelling technology that positioned AMD as a stronger competitor to Nvidia and that its latest products were superior to Intel’s. We invested on the the belief that AMD’s valuation at that that time did not reflect the potential for its technology leadership to generate significant market share gains and improved profits. This thesis has been playing out for several years. During the quarter, AMD unveiled more details about its upcoming GPU products for the AI market. The stock reacted positively to expectations that AMD’s GPU servers will be a viable alternative to Nvidia. Although we pared back our exposure to AMD into strength as part of our risk-management practice, we maintained a position in the stock. We believe AMD will continue to gain share in large and growing markets and is reasonably valued relative to the potential for significantly higher earnings.”\n\nOverall Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks as Markets Rebound.

        "title": "Apple Says No to Nvidia GPUs. Is This the End for Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to invest in since the start of 2023. Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.\n\nAlthough Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?\n\nGPUs have been the most popular option for training AI models\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.\n\nBut because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.\n\nOne of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.\n\nThis is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's investment thesis hinges on customers buying more GPUs\n\nPart of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.\n\nThis could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.\n\nThis is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.\n\nStill, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.\n\nTime will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate. But it's a great point to remember if you're considering investing in Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom is well underway, and there may be no company that's benefited from it more than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). For years, the company's semiconductors have been a top choice among leading tech companies for AI processing, and now, it's paying off for Nvidia's stock.\n\nThe company's share price has more than doubled over the past year, causing many investors to wonder: Where does Nvidia go from here? Here are a few thoughts on the company's leading AI position and what it could mean over the next year.\n\nMaintaining AI dominance\n\nTo understand where Nvidia might be a year from now, you need to know where it is right now -- sitting at the top of the AI hill. Nvidia holds an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market and is continually innovating to hold onto its lead.\n\nThe company recently released its H200 AI processor, the follow-up to its ultra-popular H100. CEO Jensen Huang says that demand is already outstripping supply.\n\nHow does this AI dominance translate into a real benefit for Nvidia? The company's data center revenue -- which includes its AI chip sales -- soared 427% from the year-ago quarter in Q1 (which ended April 28), reaching $22.6 billion.\n\nWhat about Nvidia's competition? It does have some worthy rivals. Advanced Micro Devices is its main competitor and shouldn't be ignored. But even the scale of AMD's AI growth is minuscule, compared to Nvidia.\n\nAMD's second-quarter (ending June 29) data center sales rose 115% to just $2.8 billion. While impressive, it's just a fraction of Nvidia's data center revenue and far below its sales growth.\n\nMore AI investments\n\nSome of the world's largest tech companies made headlines recently when they reported quarterly results. Investors were interested in their revenue and earnings, but their billions of dollars in AI spending garnered lots of attention.\n\nHere's how two tech CEOs recently defended the considerable spending spree:\n\n\"I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you're out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a recent podcast.\n\n\"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said on his company's latest earnings call.\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, other tech companies are spending massive amounts of money to compete in AI, as well, and all of their collective spending will total $1 trillion over the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no guarantee that Nvidia will benefit from these investments or that companies will continue to invest as heavily as they have over the past year. But tech companies are currently embattled in an AI land grab. Nvidia's AI chips are the best, and spending is on the rise. That puts the company in a great position over the next year.\n\nA potential buying opportunity\n\nLet me state the obvious first: Nvidia is expensive. The company's shares have a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 40.9. That's not cheap by any measure, but it's less expensive than its shares were this time last year when it had a P/E ratio of about 63.\n\nA recent pullback in the stock market -- thanks to a handful of factors, including concerns about U.S. job growth -- has pushed Nvidia's share price down about 20% over the past month. This recent dip could be an opening for investors who are bullish on AI.\n\nNvidia's shares won't see the massive gains they've experienced over the past year. However, considering its leading AI position, along with the fact that large tech companies are ramping up AI infrastructure spending, Nvidia has the potential to outpace the market over the next year or more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nearly 20,000 Intel Employees Are Heading For The Exits: How Salaries Stack Up Against Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft And More\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced plans to slash jobs in an effort to drive cost savings across its business.\n\nHere’s a look at just how much Intel was paying its employees and how it compares to other tech giants.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nWhat To Know: Intel and other big tech companies rarely share salary details. However, they must disclose salary offers or potential salary ranges when they hire foreign workers through the H-1B visa program.\n\nAccording to a Business Insider report citing work-visa applications submitted to the U.S. Office of Foreign Labor Certification in 2022, Intel’s highest salary offer was around $263,000, sent to an engineering manager.\n\nTrending:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nIntel announced a cost-reduction plan last week.\n\nThe actions include structural and operating realignment across the company. This includes headcount reductions of greater than 15% plus operating expenses and capital expenditure reductions of more than $10 billion in 2025. Intel’s headcount is currently around 125,000, so the company is likely to lay off around 19,000 employees.\n\nHere’s a look at the annual salary of those former Intel employees:\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analysts: $65,437 to $142,438 Information Security Analysts: $107,994 to $170,248 Supply Chain Planning Analysts: $85,467 to $96,034 Product Marketing Engineers: $102,606 to $150,093 Mechanical Engineers: $81,765 to $121,576 Engineering Managers: $117,624 to $263,952 Application Developers: $92,488 to $121,763 Program Managers: $67,621 to $168,834 Data Scientists: $65,229 to $152,681\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nWhy It Matters: When compared to other big tech companies, Intel appears to be offering prospective employees less money. It’s worth noting that the data doesn’t include stock-based compensation, individual performance rewards or bonuses that can significantly increase overall pay.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom to date, has offered salaries ranging from $74,460 to $786,000.\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFellow AI leader Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) made salary offers ranging from $77,000 to $310,000 in 2022 and Microsoft-backed OpenAI is paying the average engineer about $925,000 per year in total compensation.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) offered prospective workers base salaries of $102,000 to $322,000 in 2022 and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered workers salaries ranging from $55,000 to $340,000.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

        "title": "Investing $25,000 Into These 2 Stocks 15 Years Ago Would Have Made You Nearly $11 Million",
        "content": "A recession can seem like a bad time to invest in stocks. But if you're willing to invest in growing businesses and hang on for the long term, it can pay off, significantly. Two excellent examples of that are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also known as Supermicro.\n\nIf you had invested $25,000 into these stocks right after the Great Recession ended, 15 years ago, you would be sitting on some life-changing returns right now.\n\nNvidia: $8.9 million\n\nIt's no secret that chipmaker Nvidia has been one of the best investments to have owned over the years. But what's truly astounding is the magnitude of those gains. If you invested $25,000 into the stock back in July 2009, when the Great Recession had just ended, that investment would now be worth a staggering $8.9 million.\n\nThe bulk of the stock's gains happened within the past few years when interest in artificial intelligence (AI) took off. Nvidia has become synonymous with AI as its chips are used heavily in developing AI models and software. Even with the stock's recent dip in value, Nvidia would have made a phenomenal investment to hold over the long term.\n\nOther tech companies may still be trying to figure out AI and how best to create models and make money from new products. And as they are doing that, in many cases, they are buying chips from Nvidia. And all that AI hype and excitement is visible just by looking at the company's fast-growing financials.\n\nIn its most recent fiscal year, which ended on Jan. 28, the company's revenue came in at just under $61 billion -- more than tripling from the $16.7 billion it generated three years earlier. What's even more impressive is its earnings growth, which has gone from $4.3 billion during that time to $29.8 billion this past year.\n\nThe AI revolution is still in its early stages, which is why investors remain bullish on the stock's long-term prospects. It may not be too late to invest in Nvidia given its dominance in the AI chip market and data centers, but with a forward price-to-earnings multiple of more than 40 and investors becoming more wary of high-priced AI stocks of late, there could be some volatility in the near term, and investors will likely need some patience as it could take some time to earn good returns from buying the stock today.\n\nSupermicro: $2 million\n\nSupermicro stock has also generated some mammoth returns for investors. A $25,000 investment into the stock in July 2009 would now be worth around $2 million. When combined with the $8.9 million you could have made from Nvidia with the same size of an investment, your portfolio would be worth nearly $11 million by investing $25,000 into each of these two high-powered tech stocks.\n\nAs is the case with Nvidia, Supermicro's valuation has been on fire due to AI over the past couple of years. The company is a big player in cloud and storage solutions. Its products are in high demand as businesses expand and grow their online offerings. Companies need to build the necessary infrastructure to accommodate next-gen AI products, and Supermicro's servers and storage solutions help businesses accomplish that.\n\nBack in fiscal 2020 (its fiscal year ends in June), Supermicro's revenue totaled $3.3 billion. Now, however, even its quarterly revenue is higher than that. Business has been red hot for Supermicro and as companies continue to spend heavily on AI, the stock is sure to benefit from those developments.\n\nThe stock trades at a forward P/E of 17, which looks cheap for Supermicro given its impressive results. Despite its strong gains, this can still make for a solid investment to buy and hold right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Q3’s Rising Stars: 3 Flying Car Stocks for Your Must-Watch List",
        "content": "Price pullbacks are healthy for the stock market, happening at a 15% correction every other year on average. The recent market correction offers flying car stocks to watch an opportunity for the big future play.\n\nWhether one calls them air taxis, eVTOLs or flying cars, electrified air transportation is a natural outgrowth of miniature quadcopter technology. Across many variations, their main advantage is to take off and land vertically in urban zones without producing enormous noise like helicopters.\n\nNot counting logistics delivery, air taxi service alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.24%, from $3.68 billion in 2023 to $15.27 billion by 2031, per Kings Research. However, companies have to overcome many regulatory and technical challenges to make it happen.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are the three flying car stocks to watch as the most likely to succeed in jumping over those hoops with flying colors.\n\nEHang Holdings Limited ADS (EH) Flying taxi or Car-drone-EHang 216 exhibited by Prestige Image Motor Cars at the 2023 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) at JIExpo Kemayoran. EH stock\n\nSource: Toto Santiko Budi / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to Serve Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV), China’s EHang (NASDAQ:EH) develops its own autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) for urban air mobility. However, while Serve relies on Magna International (NYSE:MGA) to manufacture its grounded sidewalk robots, EHang manufactures its own drones like the EH216-S.\n\nTherefore, EHang should not be viewed as a robotics-as-a-service (RaaS) company. More ambitious, EHang is forging partnerships with cities to pave the road for the emerging low-altitude economy rather than supplement existing delivery services. This includes AAV solutions for commercial (passenger and cargo) airlines, logistics (delivery) and aerial tourism.\n\nSo far, the company established strategic partnerships with Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Llíria in Spain, Lyon in France and Dubai in UAE. With EHang’s lower range of up to 40km and payload of up to 260kg, the company is counting on mass production of cheaper AAVs in metropolitan areas.\n\nIn regulatory-friendly China, at the end of July, the company delivered 10 units to Xishan Tourism after having completed passenger-carrying flights and receiving Air Operator Certificate. To bolster its portfolio of AAVs, EHang also has variants EH216-F (firefighting), EH216-L (logistics) and the pilotless VT-30 for longer-range 2-passenger flights of up to 300 km.\n\nPresently priced at $11.70, EH stock is widely perceived as a “buy” according to WSJ data with an average price target of $26.30 per share.\n\nLilium (LILM) The website for Lilium (LILM) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt the end of May’s EBACE2024 event in Geneva, German Lilium (NASDAQ:LILM), one of the top flying car stocks to watch, revealed its full-scale Lilium Jet eVTOL model. After extensive flight and engine testing, Lilium Jet is the prime candidate for scaled Regional Air Mobility (RAM) rollout.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July, the oil-rich Saudis were confident enough to forge a binding sales agreement for 50 Lilium Jets, with an option for 50 more. In fact, 2024 is looking to be the milestone year for Lilium as the company cements its international presence across the U.K., U.S., and China.\n\nAt the same time as EBACE2024 took place, UK’s Volare Aviation, managing chartered flights with helicopters and jets, ordered 4 Lilium Jets while reserving up to 12 more. Of particular note indicating Lilium’s seriousness is the company’s POWER-ON platform which makes it a compelling pick.\n\nJust like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tied its AI-training framework with its chips, Lilium’s February launch of POWER-ON makes it easy for companies to integrate eVTOL services. Dusting Dryden, eVolare founder, summed it up in highly favorable terms.\n\n“…between their support and services organization – Lilium POWER-ON – their regulatory support with authorities, and their experience with ground infrastructure development, we fully trust Lilium to be the best eVTOL partner…”\n\nCombined with the technical capabilities of Lilium Jet, and the company’s plan for up to 100-passenger eVTOLs, Lilium is likely to become a household name when thinking about air taxis of the future. At this incipient stage, this makes LILM of the top flying car stocks to watch.\n\nPresently priced at $0.7767 per share, LILM stock is forecasted for an average price target of $1.94 according to WSJ.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat Lilium represents for Europe, Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) represents for the US. In early 2020, Toyota (NYSE:TM) committed $394 million to Santa Cruz-based company, signaling a strong likelihood of its success given Toyota’s legacy track record.\n\nNot only does Toyota provide Joby’s key actuator and powertrain components, but scaling operations as well courtesy of the Toyota Production System. This is critical to forge a large stake in the mobility air market early on. Joby’s first exhibition taxi flight happened in November 2023 in New York City.\n\nIt is also notable that Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) picked Joby Aviation for home-to-airport air taxi services. Delta Airlines ranks first with nearly 25% market share as of Q2 2024. The company achieved a record operating revenue of $16.7 billion, with an adjusted figure of $15.4 billion.\n\nAfter the initial investment of $60 million in October 2022, Delta left a $200 million leeway as Joby Aviation crosses air taxi milestones.\n\nSo far, Joby applied to have its commercial passenger services in the US, the UK, Japan, and Australia. The latter is a part of the bilateral agreement between the US and Australia for FAA-type certification. By early 2026, the company will launch a commercial air taxi service in Dubai.\n\nPresently priced at $5.18, JOBY is forecasted to reach $7.40 as the average price target per WSJ. The high ceiling is $11 in the short term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nDue to its proximity to cryptocurrency markets, leading crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) has performed exceptionally well in 2024 thanks to the sustained growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase offers embedded finance for users to freely trade cryptocurrencies via its app around the world, helping to democratize the world of crypto for retail investors.\n\nThe stock ended the first half of 2024 28% higher, and despite recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, COIN remains on course for an excellent year of growth. And that’s after suffering as negative growth swept through the crypto landscape in 2022 and early 2023.\n\nCoinbase’s strong performance this year is backed by its impressive fundamentals. In its Q2 2024 earnings report, COIN posted net revenue that more than doubled to $1.4 billion, while net income climbed to $36 million, in comparison to a loss of $97 million over the same period last year.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency markets are weaker today, optimism remains strong for a bull market to drive cryptocurrencies higher in 2024 and 2025. Should this occur, we’re likely to see COIN’s growth outpace the S&P 500 comfortably.\n\nWall Street guru Cathie Wood wasted no time buying the dip in Coinbase shares in the wake of the crypto downturn, picking up 93,797 COIN worth $17.8 million on August 5. For investors who believe in the long-term capabilities of blockchain and cryptocurrency, Coinbase is an attractive stock to pick up at August’s discounted rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

This is a major boost for the stock, given the speculative nature of the generative AI boom helping to facilitate its growth in recent years.\n\nNvidia’s Q2 earnings project a 107% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth to $28 billion.

That makes its weaker 2024 performance a possible strong buy-in opportunity for a stronger end to the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Despite a recent dip, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on a tear with a gain of more than 600% since the start of 2023. Its market capitalization soared from $360 billion to $2.5 trillion over that period, the fastest pace of value creation in stock market history.\n\nBut is it justified? Some analysts on Wall Street think Nvidia stock is overvalued, and they might be right in the short term based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share (EPS), and it's one of the most widely-used valuation metrics among investors.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 index, which includes Nvidia and all of its big-tech peers, trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7. Nvidia stock trades at a P/E ratio of around 58 based on its trailing-12-month EPS of $1.80, making it nearly twice as expensive as the index.\n\nBased on those numbers alone, Nvidia stock is unquestionably expensive. However, the company is growing so quickly the situation completely changes if you look just one year into the future. Wall Street estimates Nvidia will generate $3.74 in EPS in its fiscal 2026 (which will begin Jan. 30, 2025), which means its stock is even cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 on a forward-looking basis: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia's data center chips are critical to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), and while competition is gradually emerging, the company has built a significant technological lead. Its data center revenue surged 427% in the most recent quarter, and demand isn't forecast to slow anytime soon.\n\nSo, for investors with a time horizon of at least several years, Nvidia stock might actually be a bargain right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "US stocks concluded the week with a modest rebound, with the S&P 500 index rising by 0.5%, therefore marking the strongest consecutive daily gains of the year.\n\nThe rebound in stocks helped to offset much of the losses from earlier in the week, which began with a massive selloff, the most severe trading day since 2022.\n\nDespite the initial market turbulence and concerns about a potential economic downturn, recent corporate earnings reports have provided some insight into persistent trends, such as reduced consumer demand.\n\nThe week saw mixed performance across sectors, with consumer discretionary and materials sectors declining, while information technology and communication services outperformed the broader market.\n\nMaterials was the worst-performing sector (-1.7%) while Energy and Industrials both gained +1.2%.\n\nThe technology sector experienced mixed results, with semiconductor stocks slightly down. Notable losses were seen in shares of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, while Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX), and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) saw gains.\n\nThe software subsector, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase, bolstered by strong performances from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Inc. Tech hardware also advanced, led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).\n\nIn the communication services sector, media and entertainment companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) contributed to a 1.0% sector gain. Telecommunication services also saw an uptick, with Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc reaching new heights.\n\nHealthcare stocks mirrored the broader market's performance. The pharmaceuticals subsector was a standout, with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares surging after a blowout earnings report. However, the biotechnology and life sciences segments saw declines, with Gilead Sciences Inc (NASDAQ:GILD), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) facing setbacks.\n\nFinancials slightly outpaced the market, with advances in banks, insurance, and financial services. JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), and American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) were among the top gainers, while Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) Inc saw declines.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector aligned with the market, with the automobiles and durables&apparel subsectors making modest gains. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) were among the notable climbers. The real estate sector saw gains in REITs, with Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) Inc reaching record highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnergy stocks mostly rose following a jump in WTI crude oil prices, which were up 1% on the week. While the oil, gas, and consumable fuels subsector saw some gains, energy equipment and services faced a decline. Utilities also lagged behind the market, with electric utilities and multi-utilities experiencing mixed results.\n\nIndustrial stocks remained mostly unchanged, with transportation suffering losses and aerospace&defense gaining. The materials sector underperformed, with chemicals making slight gains, while construction materials, metals&mining, and containers&packaging faced declines.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 could mean for U.S. energy stocks\n\nHow to rebalance your portfolio to hedge against market risks\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia's Stock Has Peaked, and the First Domino to Fall Will Only Exacerbate Its Sell-Off",
        "content": "Three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and kicked off a chain of events that changed the growth trajectory of corporate America forever.\n\nWall Street has been waiting, sometimes impatiently, for the next-big-thing trend to come along that would rival what the internet did for businesses. After an extensive wait, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution appears ready to answer the call.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are given autonomy to oversee tasks that humans would normally handle. The key to AI's long-term success, and the source of its seemingly limitless ceiling, is the capacity for AI-driven software and systems to learn without human intervention. Machine learning gives AI the potential to become more proficient at existing tasks, as well as learn new skills.\n\nNo company has benefited more directly from the rise of AI than semiconductor goliath Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUntil recently, Nvidia's operating ramp-up had been flawless\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Nvidia was sporting a $360 billion market cap, which put it on the fringe of being one of the most influential technology companies in America. By June 20, 2024, less than two weeks after completing its historic 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia's market cap peaked at $3.46 trillion on an intra-day basis. Investors have simply never witnessed a market leader gain more than $3 trillion in value in less than 18 months before.\n\nThe catalyst behind this potentially once-in-a-lifetime move is the company's AI graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the standard in high-compute enterprise data centers. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights estimate that Nvidia was responsible for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs that were shipped to enterprise data centers in 2023.\n\nWith demand for the company's chips overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to dramatically increase the selling price of its superstar AI-accelerating chip, the H100. In a stretch of five quarters, the company's adjusted gross margin expanded by roughly 13.7 percentage points to 78.4%.\n\nHaving its hardware be the center of attention in enterprise data centers has also fueled ongoing innovation. In March, Nvidia introduced its next-generation Blackwell platform as being capable of accelerating compute capacity in a number of areas, including generative AI solutions, while consuming less energy than its predecessor. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the debut of its Rubin GPU architecture, which will be powered by a new processor, known as \"Vera.\" Rubin is set to make its debut in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle to Nvidia's, thus far, textbook operating ramp-up has been its suppliers increasing their capacity to accommodate robust demand. For example, world-leading chip-fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) has boosted its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity, which is a necessity for packaging high-bandwidth memory in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nNvidia is flawless no longer\n\nThis seemingly textbook \"recipe\" as the leader of Wall Street's hottest trend briefly helped Nvidia surpass Microsoft and Apple to become the largest publicly traded company. But after a rough couple of weeks for Nvidia and the stock market as a whole, it's become plainly evident that Nvidia is just as fallible as any other company.\n\nTo maintain its historic run-up, Nvidia needed to execute flawlessly. It had to be able to sell through all of its hardware, command a top-notch price for its products and software -- the CUDA platform, which helps developers build large language models -- and maintain its competitive edge by bringing its next-gen GPU architecture to market on time.\n\nUnfortunately, reports emerged last weekend that Nvidia has informed many of its top customers (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") that it would be delaying the shipment of its Blackwell chip for at least three months. This would push delivery into the first quarter of 2025 from an expected arrival date later this year.\n\nAccording to various reports, the delay stems from potential design flaws with Blackwell, as well as capacity constraints from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). Even with TSMC effectively doubling its CoWoS capacity, it's still nowhere near enough for Nvidia to meet the demand of enterprise clients.\n\nBlackwell's delay is the first domino to fall that signals Nvidia is less than perfect. It also opens the door for Nvidia's competition to thrive.\n\nOn July 30, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) delivered second-quarter operating results that were welcomed with open arms by Wall Street and investors. AMD's data center segment sales surged 115% from the prior-year period and 21% on a sequential quarterly basis (i.e., from what was reported for the March-ended quarter). AMD attributed this outperformance to its ramp-up of AI GPUs.\n\nIn particular, AMD's MI300X is considerably cheaper than Nvidia's H100. Even though the H100 holds a number of compute advantages over the MI300X, backlogged supply for the H100, coupled with the now-delayed Blackwell chip, gives AMD's hardware a lot more luster.\n\nTo add, all four of Nvidia's top customers have been developing AI chips for use in their data centers. Even if Nvidia retains its compute advantage, it's going to lose out on valuable data center \"real estate,\" as its top customers choose to install their internally developed (and cost-effective) chips. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory suggests the Nvidia sell-off is going to worsen\n\nTo make matters worse, there hasn't been a single next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend that's escaped an early-stage bubble in three decades. Beyond the advent of the internet, investors have watched early bubbles burst in genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, cannabis, and the metaverse.\n\nThe issue with game-changing innovations and technologies is that investors overestimate their adoption and utility. Regardless of how large the addressable market is, it takes time for new technologies to alter the growth landscape for corporate America.\n\nFor instance, even though most leading businesses are spending big on AI-driven data centers, many lack a clear blueprint as to how artificial intelligence is going to help them grow their sales and make more money. Investors saw the same story just a few years ago with the rise of the metaverse, and blockchain technology before that. All innovations need time to mature -- no exceptions!\n\nOver three decades, market leaders for every next-big-thing trend have consistently declined by 80% or more in value. On a peak-to-trough basis, the leading businesses behind the internet/networking, 3D printing, genome decoding, cannabis, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology all plummeted by 90% or more before bottoming out.\n\nThe silver lining for Nvidia is that it has multiple established segments beyond its AI GPU operations that can provide a loftier foundation than what other market leaders dealt with when their respective bubbles burst. Nvidia's GPUs used in gaming and crypto mining, coupled with its virtualization software, should prevent a total wipeout.\n\nNevertheless, history is crystal clear that a big pullback is in order once the euphoria surrounding a next-big-thing trend fades. Blackwell's delay is the first domino to fall, and it strongly suggests the Nvidia sell-off will worsen in the coming weeks, months, or quarters.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) closed the latest trading day at $104.75, indicating a -0.21% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $28.24 billion, up 109.04% from the year-ago period.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $2.69 per share and revenue of $117.82 billion, indicating changes of +106.92% and +93.39%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance.

        "content": "Brace Yourself! Intel's Stock Nosedives To Lowest In 10 Years, Suffers Worst Day on Wall Street In Half A Century\n\nIntel shares plunged by 26% to $21.48, their lowest stock price since 2013, bringing the market capitalization below the $100 billion mark. This followed the company's disappointing earnings report and the announcement of a large restructuring plan.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nThe Intel debacle directly affected the semiconductor industry worldwide, taking a toll on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. TSMC, the world’s biggest chipmaker, slid 4.6% in Taiwan. In South Korea, the world’s largest memory semiconductor maker, Samsung Electronics plunged by more than 4%. The effects reached the Nasdaq composite index, which was down 2.4%, with most of it lost due to Intel’s plunge.\n\nIntel’s latest quarterly financials were grim. The net loss was $1.61 billion, contrasted with a net income of $1.48 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at two cents, much worse than the 10 cents analysts had forecast, according to LSEG data. Revenue also missed forecasts, deepening the company's financial woes.\n\nSee Also:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nIn response, Intel announced several drastic measures. It would suspend its dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2024, slash its full-year capital expenditure forecast by more than 20%, and cut more than 15% from its workforce as part of its $10 billion cost-cutting plan.\n\nThis will be the biggest change in its organizational structure since Intel switched to Memory Microprocessors forty years ago. In an interview, a confident Gelsinger shared with CNBC’s Jon Fortt, “We have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we’re going to get that done.”\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nGelsinger also pointed to the decision to increase production for Core Ultra PC chips, tailored for AI workloads, as a factor in the financial loss. He told analysts on the call that he hadn’t expected this kind of competitive pricing environment this quarter, with AMD and Qualcomm being much more aggressive than he anticipated.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also announced job cuts that could be one of the biggest layoffs in recent tech industry history. This was communicated through a companywide memo from Gelsinger. Making matters worse for the semiconductor industry, the Department of Justice has started an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, the leader in AI chips. The department is investigating accusations that Nvidia has misused its market dominance in AI.\n\nTrending:During market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.\n\nNvidia, however, has firmly denied any wrongdoing. A company representative emphasized, “We compete on the art of a decade’s worth of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and making sure customers can choose whatever solution is best for them.” He added, “We’re happy to provide any information regulators need.”\n\nThese shock waves were felt Friday in Europe, where the shares of major semiconductor firms – including ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon – slumped. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes key players, declined 5.5% Friday, adding to its 6.5% drop the previous day.\n\nThis is the biggest challenge Intel has ever faced, with the whole industry on edge over potential disruption.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!

        "title": "Nvidia stock registers weekly loss as Wall Street sees 'urgent demand' keeping the chip trade intact",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) closed on Friday with a weekly loss of 2% as investors continue to sort through what's been a challenging last several weeks for the year's hottest trade.\n\nBut Wall Street analysts this week remained confident in the long-term prospects for Nvidia, which is now down about 20% over the last month and off more than 25% from its record closing high.\n\nEarlier this week, Piper Sandler analysts called out a \"tremendous opportunity\" to buy Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and ON Semiconductor (ON) following the sector's recent sell-off.\n\nSome analysts also took the opportunity to upgrade the stock during this sell-off.\n\n\"I think that for 2025 ... things are fairly well set,\" New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. \"We know roughly how much [hyperscalers] expect to grow capex. Plans are already set.\" New Street upgraded Nvidia to a Buy this week with a $120 price target.\n\nOn Friday, chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM), a supplier to Nvidia, posted a 45% year-over-year increase in sales in July — a sign that AI demand remains strong.\n\n\"We still sense an urgent demand across the board, and that mitigates the risk in a pause in shipments as customers wait for the next generation of chips to be available in volumes,\" said Chkaiban.\n\nThe so-called hyperscalers — Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — each remained consistent during recent earnings reports in their commitment to AI investment. And much of this investment flows right to Nvidia.\n\n“Investors will likely revisit the AI-levered names because that within [semiconductors] is still the one area spending is flowing in terms of customer spending as evidenced by increases in capex by multiple hyperscalers this earnings period,” Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\nTalk of a possible delay for Nvidia’s Blackwell next-generation chip put added pressure on the stock earlier this week. A two-month wait for the chips wouldn’t be inconsequential, analysts say, but it would still not be enough to move the needle on Wall Street expectations.\n\nCurtis's team stated in a recent note the Nvidia delays \"are real, but not a thesis changer.\" The company is set to report quarterly results at the end of August.\n\nAnalysts and strategists looking at markets more broadly also see the recent cooling in the AI trade as an opportunity.\n\nTruist Advisory's chief marketing strategist Keith Lerner upgraded the tech sector to Overweight on Thursday after a 12% decline from its mid-July peak with semiconductors down almost 20%. Lerner noted that despite the drop in the price of these stocks, tech’s forward earnings estimates continue to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This suggests the recent setback was due more to crowded positioning as opposed to a shift in fundamentals,\" Lerner wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\"Moreover, in a cooling economic environment, we expect investors to come back to tech given some of the secular tailwinds stemming from artificial intelligence (AI) and its premium growth prospects. Moreover, during the current earnings season, we have seen capital spending trends toward AI continue to rise.\"\n\nBut recent sentiment shifts don't necessarily resolve the looming question, which investors will in time want answered — how do these massive AI investments eventually pay off?\n\n\"When it comes to technology, what's very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture but also the fact that people want to see ... evidence that that GenAI trade is actually driving positive outcomes,\" Luke Barrs, managing director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"We have to just be cautious and let it play out over the next year or two.\"\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This article looks at the 40 most overcrowded cities in the world and discusses companies that are playing a key role in managing challenges that emanate from rapid urbanization. You can skip our detailed discussion and see the 5 Most Overcrowded Cities in the World here.\n\nIf interested, you can also read our article on the 50 Most Populated Countries in the World.\n\nUrbanization's Dual Impact: Challenges and Opportunities in a Rapidly Expanding World\n\nAround 4.4 billion people, equivalent to 56% of the global population, live in cities according to the World Bank. The urban population is projected to be more than double in size by 2050, resulting in nearly 70% of the world’s population residing in cities. The rapid pace of urbanization brings challenges such as a burden on existing infrastructure, and rising demand for affordable housing, transport systems, jobs, and other basic services. It also increases pollution.\n\nHaving said that, more than 80% of the world’s GDP is generated by urban areas, and urbanization, if managed well, can lead to sustainable growth in cities through innovation and increased productivity. Several large corporations are already leading the way in this realm through their sustainable practices.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been at the forefront of Asia-Pacific’s digital transformation. In 2014, the company partnered with the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) in India to transform it into a smart city and empower its residents with solutions to make citizen services more responsive and increase the productivity and efficiency of the government. Before this, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had already created a dashboard for the SMC that provided an overall view of the city’s key performance indicators and also covered aspects related to citizen complaints, healthcare, and work on ongoing projects.\n\nThe IT staff in Kobe, Japan received nearly 40,000 calls a day during the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking information that needed an immediate response. The local government used Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Power Platform to build an application that was capable of responding to most queries, except the most complex ones, resulting in a 90 percent decrease in calls in the following months. This not only resulted in a better experience for Kobe’s citizens but also helped save costs for the local administration.\n\nRaleigh in South Carolina this year announced the adoption of artificial intelligence to tackle the city’s burgeoning traffic and invested in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Metropolis platform which is designed to make cities more efficient and safer through various ways, including effective management of traffic and smart parking. The city had long been working with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to analyze traffic and find ways to reduce congestion on the roads and intersections.\n\nUnder the new system, the city administration uses NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s DeepStream platform to get real-time data on the number of vehicles entering and exiting each roads, and then this information is visualized and passed on to Raleigh’s vendors that manage the traffic lights to ensure traffic flows smoothly without any bottlenecks. James Alberque, the GIS and Emerging Technology Manager at the City of Raleigh, says that the system operates with great accuracy levels of up to 95%. Hundreds of cameras are installed across Raleigh with sights set on the flow of traffic, parking utilization, license plate tracking, waiting time at bus stops, and even road flooding after rains.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — California is partnering with tech giant Nvidia to help train the state's students, college faculty, developers and data scientists in artificial intelligence, officials announced Friday.\n\nThe initiative is part of an effort to expand resources so students, educators and workers – particularly in community colleges – can learn new skills in generative AI and advance their careers, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said. The partnership aims to add new curriculum and certifications, hardware and software, and AI labs and workshops.\n\n“California’s world-leading companies are pioneering AI breakthroughs, and it’s essential that we create more opportunities for Californians to get the skills to utilize this technology and advance their careers,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the voluntary agreement with Nvidia, California said it will adopt skills and training for state careers, including new roles for AI specialists in government.\n\nNvidia has seen soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker's invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia’s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\n“We’re in the early stages of a new industrial revolution that will transform trillion-dollar industries around the world,” said Nvidia's founder, Jensen Huang.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Perplexity AI: First ChatGPT, Now Rival Google",
        "content": "Privately-held artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Perplexity AI is slaying competition left, right, and center. Its advent first seemed to challenge OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and now Perplexity is contesting with tech giant Alphabet’s (GOOGL)(GOOG) Google Search engine. Perplexity is a free-for-all, AI-backed search engine company that seeks to offer the most accurate, reliable, and real-time answers to users’ queries.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Perplexity has reached a monthly revenue rate of seven times the amount generated at the beginning of 2024. The company is on track to reach annualized revenues of $35 million this year, up from its prior expectation of only $5 million. This is possible because Perplexity has been able to massively boost the number of queries answered on its platforms. In July, Perplexity’s search platform answered approximately 250 million queries, a staggering growth compared to 500 million questions in the full year 2023.\n\nPerplexity came into being just three months before the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI platform was started by ex-Google intern, Aravind Srinivas. It has the funding support of big names including Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, and OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy. Perplexity recently closed a funding round of $250 million, tripling its valuation from $1 billion to $3 billion.\n\nPerplexity Takes Competition Head On\n\nPerplexity crawls the internet to fetch real-time data, including news publications. In comparison, ChatGPT answers queries based on data fed up to April 2023. Another difference is that Perplexity does not build its own generative AI models. Instead, it licenses those built by OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), and others.\n\nPerplexity recently announced a revenue-sharing model with publishers, called the “Publishers Program.” It has already signed deals with Fortune, Time, Entrepreneur, Der Spiegel, WordPress.com, and others. The company believes that revenue-sharing models work better with publishers than the one-time payment models adopted by OpenAI and other model makers. Earlier in June, Perplexity faced several plagiarism accusations as it missed appropriate citations in its answers.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, Perplexity is turning towards advertisements instead of subscriptions as a major source of revenue. This makes Perplexity a closer competitor for Google Search. Meanwhile, Google will soon integrate new AI features into its products, while OpenAI has launched a prototype SearchGPT model to capture the billion-dollar search industry.\n\nChatGPT Stocks with Strong Buy Consensus\n\nWhile Perplexity and OpenAI are not publicly listed companies yet, investors can consider other stocks that are developing ChatGPT-like technology or are gearing up to capture opportunities in generative AI. Here, we can see how some of the “Strong Buy” ChatGPT stocks perform on TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks fell from grace in the month of July. After a strong start to 2024, Wall Street began to reprice earnings multiples which have expanded significantly in recent months.\n\nSemiconductor companies, including the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw its market capitalization swell to a $3 trillion valuation. This unprecedented surge is supported by the company’s more than 80% market share in AI graphic processing units (GPUs). Additionally, this innovation and leadership in one of the fastest growing industries has contributed to the company’s record revenue and earnings results.\n\nHowever, the company has since taken a breather, along with its other semiconductor counterparts. While earnings multiples have room to contract much further, there are emerging players that can become the trillion-dollar companies. For investors who remain bullish on the growth of AI and the semiconductor industry, these three companies should certainly be kept on your radar.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let’s unpack the three best semiconductor stocks to become the next trillion-dollar companies by 2030!\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top semiconductor stocks that investors should not take their eyes off in 2024. Despite its 17% fall in the past month, the company’s long term growth outlook remains strong.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is arguably one of the most important companies in the world. The company holds more than 50% market share in semiconductor foundry services, an industry that deals in the fabrication of advanced chips. Its services are becoming even more integral in the era of AI, and companies are fighting to gain share in the AI GPU market.\n\nMoreover, the demand for advanced AI chips is extremely high and has been a strong tailwind for the business in 2024. Since the start of the year, TSMC has reported double digit sales growth each month with the exception of January. The latest June revenue report saw a 33% bump in its year over year sales. With Intel foundry woes set to continue, TSM stock will undoubtedly capitalize on this demand and thrive in the years ahead.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another stock with enormous potential to join the elite group of trillion-dollar companies. While its valuation is still rich at the current levels, investors can find more certainty buying the stock under $105 per share.\n\nBroadcom is currently at the forefront of the burgeoning AI revolution. With advanced AI infrastructure products from storage solutions, adapters, to integrated circuits, the company is integral to the industry’s growth. The past year has truly been transformative for the company, with increased demand for AI networking solutions driving record revenue, earnings, and free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, revenue growth is accelerating in 2024 with the contribution of the VMware acquisition. It is expected to contribute to consolidated revenue of $50 billion and adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) of $30 billion in 2024. These numbers suggest that adjusted EBITDA will be 30% higher than 2023. Moreover, VMware is on track to be cash flow accretive in 2024. For investors eyeing long term growth, buying shares on a dip could be an extremely prudent strategy build wealth.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the final semiconductor giant with the potential to become the next trillion-dollar titan. The company’s AI-powered Snapdragon processors are extremely promising and have a variety of applications for smartphones, PCs, gaming, and the automotive sectors.\n\nQualcomm’s stock plummeted over 20% in July, continuing its downward trend with the rest of the semiconductor industry. Mounting concerns over the U.S. economy and the continued sluggish growth in the handset market had investors on edge. While these concerns are reasonable, they may very well be overblown. Qualcomm has continued to see a rebound in handset segment sales, with continued strength in automotive.\n\nFurthermore, its revenue and earnings have rebounded after an extremely tough operational year in fiscal 2023. Despite this backdrop and notable headwinds in the broader economy, Qualcomm will still look a lot more attractive than many of its peers. Ultimately, this can be a great value play for long term investors looking to snag up shares on the cheaper side later this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Is Staying Away from NVIDIA (NVDA) —Thinks Stock is in ‘Bubble Land’",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nPaul Singer of Elliott Management\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer specifically mentioned NVDA in his letter calling the stock overhyped. While he had a small stake in the company as of the end of March, his comments show he might have ended that stake in the company during the June quarter. We will find out when the fund files its latest 13F filings.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks haven't had it easy lately, but investors shouldn't toss in the towel on them during a volatile August for markets.\n\nBe precise with the picks right now given more challenging market conditions, said Wind Shift Capital founder Bill Blain.\n\nBlain — the longtime author of the Morning Porridge newsletter — tagged Meta (META) as the best Magnificent Seven play today.\n\n“The business of advertising is massive,” Blain told Yahoo Finance executive Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). “About 75% of advertising goes through the internet, and the firm that controls that best at the moment is [Meta].”\n\nMeta's second quarter earnings last week underscore Blain's bullish call.\n\nEarnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 73% from a year ago.\n\nIts app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) also walloped expectations with revenues of $38.72 billion. Sales for the app family rose about $7 billion year over year.\n\nMeta stock has rallied 7.5% since the company's Aug. 1 earnings report, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares are still off by 4% in the past month as sentiment has soured on the Magnificent Seven name.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven includes Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta.\n\nUnlike Meta, the other six names have dealt with various negative news in recent weeks that have pressured their shares.\n\nNvidia is reportedly delaying the shipment of its new Blackwell AI chips by a quarter. Tesla had a terrible second quarter. Alphabet preached of needing more time for AI adoption, while market leader Microsoft's AI results didn't live up to expectations. Amazon warned of a slowing consumer in its second quarter.\n\nAll of the non-Meta Magnificent Seven stocks are down since Meta's earnings report, led by a 13% drop in Tesla stock.\n\nThen there is Apple.\n\nBlain, who had been bullish on Apple, has recently shifted perspective.\n\n“When Warren Buffett turned around and dumped the stock, I thought, he must know something I don’t,” said Blain.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) reportedly slashed its stake in the tech giant by as much as 50%. It's unclear as to Buffett's motivation, but it sent a negative signal to an increasingly jittery market.

        "title": "The Sky’s the Limit for These 3 Cloud Computing Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "This era of artificial intelligence and cloud computing has led to companies pouring billions into the segment. Cloud computing service providers have benefitted from the AI hype, where they provide the cloud infrastructure where AI systems can be used. Companies have successfully managed to save millions in data center costs, and some of the biggest tech giants are aggressively building new data centers to cater to the rising demand. This calls for a focus on the top cloud computing stocks of the year.\n\nWith the adoption of AI, higher cloud capacity will be required. The industry is poised for massive growth, and despite the rising competition, a few companies continue to rule it. If you want to make the most of the demand for cloud computing, here are three cloud computing stocks to add to your portfolio this year. These are some of the most promising stocks in the industry.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top tech companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is known for innovation and is a leader in the tech space. The most valuable company in the world, Microsoft is making the most of AI and cloud computing. Its investment in AI is already paying off, and the company’s most significant revenue generator is the cloud computing segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUp 7% year-to-date, Microsoft stock is exchanging hands for $402 and is trading much lower than the 52-week high of $468. I believe the current dip is a chance to pounce on this high-quality stock.\n\nIn the recent quarterly results, the company saw a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue to $64.7 billion and a 10% jump in net income to $22 billion. Earnings per share came in at $2.95, up 10% from last year. The cloud segment accounted for a revenue of $28.5 billion, which saw a 29% jump.\n\nWhile it was below the firm’s guidance of a 30% to 31% increase, it is still impressive. If you look at the bigger picture, Microsoft is leading the cloud computing segment, and I believe it will continue to benefit from the rapid demand for Azure. Regarding AI and cloud computing, Microsoft continues to dominate the market.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers software that allows consumers to migrate their data to the cloud. It also owns data centers that support the solutions. Unlike other companies, it didn’t start investing in AI last year but has been investing in it for many years, and this investment has begun to reap benefits now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe one reason I put this stock on the list is its subscription revenue and the high renewable rate. ServiceNow has an enviable renewal rate of 98%. In the recent quarter, it saw a 23% jump in subscription revenue to $2.5 billion, and the current outstanding performance obligations stood at $8.8 billion, up 22%.\n\nAfter a stellar quarter, the management raised the full-year subscription revenue guidance to $10.6 billion, aiming for a 22% year-over-year growth. While its valuation has significantly increased over the past year, I like the stock now because of its strong operating margin, cash flow, and impressive clientele. ServiceNow used to sell its product independently earlier but has recently partnered with Microsoft and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop generative AI tools.\n\nIt managed to sign 11 deals for its product, Pro Plus, worth over $1 million in the quarter. The company has expanded to the Middle East and will launch ServiceNow UAE to cater to the companies there. Exchanging hands for $800, NOW stock is up 12% YTD and 12% this year.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) is a legacy business that has seen several market ups and downs. With growing investment in AI, Oracle is on its way to becoming an industry leader. It is already building 100 data centers and has partnered with Microsoft.\n\nOracle has also partnered with OpenAI to expand the Microsoft Azure platform and provide additional capacity for OpenAI. Besides Microsoft, Oracle has partnerships with Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and industry leader Nvidia.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Oracle saw a 3% YOY rise in revenue to $14.3 billion and cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 42% YOY to $2 billion. In the third and the fourth quarter, the company signed the largest sales contracts in its history, driven by the demand for cloud and AI large language models. For the fourth quarter alone, it managed to ink over 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion.\n\nOracle has established itself as a leader in the cloud segment. Its remaining performance obligations at $98 billion show its strength amid the competitive industry. Up 22% YTD, Oracle stock is exchanging hands for $129 and enjoys a dividend yield of 1.2%.\n\nOracle’s strong relationships with Fortune 500 companies allow it to sell its AI solutions and cloud expertise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "This month, a sell-off has wiped billions from the stock market, with the Nasdaq Composite down nearly 10% in the last 30 days. Fears of a recession have deeply concerned investors after news broke that the U.S. added 114,000 jobs in July against expectations of 175,000.\n\nHowever, tech's long growth history and reputation for offering stockholders consistent and significant gains over many years make it a compelling place to invest. Despite a sell-off, the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite has risen 280% since 2014. So, recent declines actually present an exciting investment opportunity and the chance to pick up some stocks for a better value.\n\nMarkets such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, semiconductors, and more still have plenty of room to grow over the long term and could fuel the industry for decades.\n\nSo, got $5,000 spare? Here are two tech stocks to buy and hold for the long term. However, even a smaller investment could go far with these companies.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price is down 16% over the last month. The recent sell-off hasn't been kind to the world's third most valuable tech company and the unofficial poster child for AI. However, at 21% below its all-time high in June, Nvidia's shares remain a compelling option for long-term-minded investors.\n\nDespite recent declines, Nvidia hasn't given any indication that its earnings won't continue soaring, thanks to its lead in the chip market. The company is responsible for at least 80% of the AI chip market, 91% of data center graphics processing units (GPUs), and 88% of desktop GPUs (chips sold directly to consumers).\n\nAccording to a study from TechInsights, Nvidia shipped 3.76 million data center GPUs in 2023. For reference, a total of 3.85 million data center GPUs were shipped during the year when including sales from AMD and Intel.\n\nNvidia's success has seen its earnings skyrocket, extending its lead over rivals. Since last August, the chipmaker's quarterly revenue and operating income have increased by 44% and 62%, with free cash flow rising 112% to $15 billion. Meanwhile, AMD's free cash flow reached $439 million this year, and Intel's is at negative $3 billion. Nvidia's market dominance and significant cash reserves will likely prove a formidable combination over the long term as chip demand continues to rise and the company reinvests in its business.\n\nNvidia is trading at 60 times its earnings, which doesn't exactly shout \"Bargain!\" However, that figure is significantly lower than its five-year average of 80, signaling an excellent time to buy its stock and hold it indefinitely.\n\nStory continues\n\nHalf of your $5,000 would buy about 25 shares in Nvidia at its current price.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has seen its stock slip 17% since early July amid a market downturn. However, consistently expanding cloud and advertising divisions illustrate a shift in its business model that could pay off over the long term.\n\nThe company posted its second quarter of 2024 earnings on Aug. 1, revealing a bit of a mixed bag. Revenue rose 10% year over year but missed expectations by $760 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $1.26 beat consensus estimates by $0.23, proving the effectiveness of recent cost-cutting measures. The company suffered from softer-than-expected sales for the quarter, with revenue from its online store rising 5% year over year.\n\nHowever, solid growth from its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its advertising services strengthened its long-term outlook. In Q2, AWS sales jumped 19%, while operating income soared 74%. Meanwhile, revenue from ads on platforms like Prime Video increased 20% year over year as the segment continued on its positive growth trajectory.\n\nRetail remains a lucrative venture. However, it can also be a weak point for Amazon as the business relies heavily on the state of the economy and consumers' spending power. As a result, solid growth in more stable sectors like cloud computing and digital ads is promising for Amazon's future.\n\nAmazon's quarterly operating income and free cash flow have soared 31% and 186% over the last year, mainly thanks to the profitability of AWS. Alongside a price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio that are well below Amazon's 10-year average for both metrics, the company's stock is a no-brainer right now and worth at least half of your $5,000 investment. That $2,500 would yield about 15 shares of Amazon at its current position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Dump After Disappointing Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "The trade in technology stocks is getting more difficult. The mega-cap tech names known collectively as the “Magnificent Seven” lost a combined $1 trillion of value amid the global market rout that occurred on August 5. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost $168 billion in market capitalization as its stock fell 6.4%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended down 4.8% and 4.1% respectively on the day. As you can see, market volatility is impacting even the biggest names, helping identify the top tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nHowever, the declines are more broad-based, with many technology stocks suffering losses since the beginning of July when investors began rotating money out of tech names and into value and small-cap securities. That rotation has only worsened amid rising fears that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession and as many well-known technology companies report poor second-quarter financial results.\n\nIt’s a big reversal from this year’s first half when technology stocks led the market rally as investors bet on the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot even a 10-for-1 stock split could paper over Super Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) horrible second-quarter financial results. SMCI stock is down 18% in the last five days, as the company reported EPS of $6.25, missing Wall Street’s target of $8.07. Revenue totaled $5.31 billion, which was only marginally better than the $5.30 billion that was forecast.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Super Micro Computer said that its gross margin dropped to 11.2% in Q2 from 17% a year earlier. A lower margin means the company is earning less profit on each product it sells. The company’s forward guidance was nothing to write home about either. A Q3 earnings outlook of a $7.48 midpoint fell below consensus estimates of $7.58.\n\nAs for the stock split, it’s due to occur on October 1. But with the stock down 60% from its 52-week high and trading under $500 a share, is a split even needed? SMCI stock has fallen 45% since the start of July, making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost as bad as the Q2 print delivered by Super Micro Computer was the one from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Shares of the company plunged 15% after management reported Q2 earnings that missed Wall Street’s target. Airbnb reported EPS of 86 cents, which was below the consensus forecast among analysts of 92 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue of $2.75 billion slightly beat estimates of $2.74 billion, and sales were up 11% from a year earlier. However, the outlook provided on the earnings call sunk the stock. Specifically, management warned that it anticipates some moderation in its year-over-year bookings during the current third quarter. They cautioned that they are seeing “…some signs of slowing demand from U.S. guests.”\n\nInvestors are carefully watching for signs that consumers are pulling back on spending amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing and might be headed for a recession. ABNB stock is down 22% in the last 12 months.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) reported great financials for Q1 when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were at an all-time high. But that was then, this is now. For the second quarter, Coinbase announced decidedly mixed financial results amid a slump in cryptocurrency prices and trading demand. Specifically, Coinbase posted EPS of 14 cents, which badly missed Wall Street consensus targets of 94 cents.\n\nRevenue of $1.45 billion did exceed the average analyst estimate of $1.37 billion. However, sales in Q2 were down 27% from the previous quarter. The company said that its results suffered due to a decline in trading volumes and losses on its crypto assets. Management said trading activity on its exchange has been subdued with crypto prices slumping and range bound over the past few months. COIN stock has fallen 20% since its Q2 print was made public making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks with Promising Applications",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence made headlines in 2024, with stocks in the space appreciating tremendously. Amid the growing adoption of technology, many companies are shelling out billions to advance their AI capabilities.\n\nAccording to a recent report by CompTIA, 22% of companies aim to pursue AI integration across their products. The report also found that 33% of companies are working with some type of AI application to improve their service and product delivery.\n\nBy riding this wave, investors can be sure to see gains over the medium term. Artificial intelligence is still in its infancy, which means these stocks hold great potential. Numerous technology applications are still being explored.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor instance, it could have use cases in defense, chatbots and data analysis. Consider these three companies if you want to invest in solid artificial intelligence stocks with great promise in returns. Let’s examine why these three stocks stand out.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) started as a graphics card company. However, its chips quickly became popular in the artificial intelligence sector. Since then, the company has been working to produce faster and more efficient chips for the industry.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang has played an important role in this transformation, making Nvidia the go-to company for the best artificial intelligence chips.\n\nThus far, Huang’s efforts have paid off and Nvidia has been the top artificial intelligence stock of 2024. Despite sliding by double digits in the past few weeks, NVDA is still up 116.42% year. Over the past 12 months, the stock has gained 129.52%.\n\nLooking at the EPS, Nvidia has continued to maintain phenomenal growth. In the last quarterly results, it reported an EPS of $5.98, a 629% year-over-year increase.\n\nIts current trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 59.59 is relatively high. However, this high valuation is justifiable if it continues to maintain earnings growth.\n\nAdditionally, the company has a robust buyback program and pays out dividends. In its first quarter fiscal 2025 results, it announced it had increased payouts by 150% to 10 cents per share.\n\nOver the past five years, NVDA has been one of the best-performing stocks, rising over 2500%.\n\nThe great stock performance, increased dividend payouts and the rising adoption of AI make Nvidia one of the best artificial intelligence stocks to own in August 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET)\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a leading software provider in the cloud computing and data center industries. The rise of artificial intelligence has been a huge boost for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll artificial intelligence models require massive amounts of data, which is where Arista comes in. It is helping to create networks that can adapt to the changing needs of large language models and other artificial intelligence use cases.\n\nIts stock performance has been quite robust. Year-to-date, it has gained 39.72% to $323.54 per share. In the past 12 months, its stock price has gained over 80%. If you had invested in ANET five years ago, you would have seen returns of almost 500% so far.\n\nIts trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 42.69 is quite high. However, the stock has also maintained robust earnings growth. Its diluted earnings per share have steadily been on the rise since 2020. As a result, its elevated valuation is justifiable.\n\nLooking at its financial results, Arista saw revenue rise 15.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to $1.69 billion. It also reported a GAAP net income of $665.4 million compared to $491.9 million the previous year.\n\nBased on its robust financial and stock performance, ANET is one of the main artificial intelligence stocks that should be in your portfolio in August 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms (META)\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a giant tech company best known for its social media platforms, Instagram and Facebook. The company is also one of the leading investors in artificial intelligence.\n\nOne of its well-known products to date is Llama 3.1, an open-source artificial intelligence model. In its second quarter fiscal 2024 results, Meta revealed it plans to spend up to $40 billion on research, with a good chunk of that going to artificial intelligence.\n\nDespite the huge capital expenditure, Meta reported astronomical profits with net income of $13.47 billion compared to $7.79 billion the previous year.\n\nInvestors have reacted positively to this increased spending with META up 42.68% this year and its value rising by 56% over the last 12 months.\n\nBased on its robust financial results and rising expenditures on artificial intelligence, Meta could be the go-to investment for artificial intelligence stocks. It shows great promise and has the financial capacity to develop technology to the next level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 5.3% to briefly top $62,000, extending gains from Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome traders think the quick reversal suggests that the recent price dip might have been a bear trap. “What an insane weekly. Probably the most epic bear trap I’ve ever seen,” pseudonymous crypto trader Byzantine General wrote in an X post.\n\nIn the medium term, macro factors “will continue to weigh on risk assets,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of business development in Asia-Pacific at crypto market-maker Keyrock. The unwinding of the yen carry trade “isn’t something that gets resolved in a couple of days,” he added.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nCryptocurrency markets crashed on Monday in one of the sector’s worst routs since two of the top crypto assets went mainstream this year with the launch of spot-bitcoin and spot-ether exchange-traded funds in the US in January and July, respectively.\n\nTSMC (TSMC34.SA)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's revenue rose 45% in July as AI demand continues to drive growth at the chip maker.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC's consolidated revenue for July reached approximately NT$256.95bn (£6.19bn/$7.91bn), marking a 23.6% increase from June and a significant 44.7% rise from the same period in 2023, setting a new monthly record.\n\nThat was an even bigger year-over-year rise for the contract chip maker than the previous month’s figure, which helped trigger a rally in chip stocks as investors assess the strong demand for artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nRead more: When you have to start paying tax on your savings\n\nTSMC projected third quarter revenue to reach between $22.4bn and $23.2bn, representing a quarter-on-quarter growth of 7.58% to 11.43%.\n\nThe company is the sole supplier of processors for Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones and the go-to chipmaker for leading tech companies like Nvidia and AMD (AMD).\n\nHargreaves Lansdown (HL.L)\n\nHargreaves Lansdown has agreed to a takeover offer worth £5.44bn from a consortium including buyout giant CVC Capital Partners and the Abu Dhabi wealth fund.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown shareholders will get 1,110 pence per share and a dividend of 30 pence per share under the deal, the company said.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown chair Alison Platt said in a statement that the offer “represents an attractive opportunity for HL Shareholders.”\n\nThe group of bidders includes buyout giant CVC, alongside Nordic Capital, and Platinum Ivy, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The consortium is owned in equal parts by the three firms.\n\nHargreaves also published its full-year results today, showing total revenues up 4% to £765m and profit before tax down 2% to £396m.\n\nA 43.2p dividend was announced.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Nvidia earnings the next key catalyst for Big Tech: Barclays",
        "content": "Nvidia’s upcoming earnings report could be the next key catalyst for Big Tech stocks, Barclays strategists said in a note published Friday.\n\nAmidst the various macroeconomic factors driving up cross-asset volatility in recent weeks, concerns about AI spending have further impacted equities. As such, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Q2 earnings on August 28 will be closely watched, as they \"may hold the fate of the Big Tech vs. rotation trade,” strategists noted.\n\n“While AI-related capex from the Tech giants has generally been strong, investors are starting to question the high spending given actual AI revenues are likely to take longer to materialize,” they added.\n\nStill, Barclays views the roughly 16% drop in European tech stocks, and the approximately 30% decline in some of its key players, such as ASML (AS:ASML), as potentially overdone. This outlook prompted them to re-enter European Tech with an overweight position this week.\n\nThe investment bank expresses a preference for the long-term secular growth potential and quality aspects that the tech sector offers, as opposed to the value-cyclical nature of other struggling sectors like Autos.\n\nThe recent sharp equity market movements have been intensified by the de-grossing of leveraged positions among systematic investors. Many leveraged trades involved shorting low-yielding Japanese yen assets to benefit from attractive carry.\n\nHowever, following the Bank of Japan's rate hike and soft U.S. employment data, the rate differential has shifted in favor of Japanese assets, forcing investors to exit these carry trades, Barclays strategists explained. This has led to a sharp pullback in liquidity-driven markets.\n\nThe bank’s FX team suggests that yen weakness might resume once market positioning stabilizes and U.S. recession fears subside, but further yen appreciation is possible if the global rate-cutting cycle accelerates due to a recession. They observed a significant reduction in yen shorts ahead of the BoJ meeting and expect more closures since then.\n\n“Price action may stay erratic given summer seasonality and elevated volatility,” strategists cautioned.\n\nNonetheless, they find the recent indiscriminate selling \"excessive\" and see buying opportunities for long-term investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia earnings the next key catalyst for Big Tech: Barclays\n\nEarnings call: Prestige Consumer Healthcare tops Q1 expectations\n\nEarnings call: Lincoln Tech sees robust growth in Q2 with revenue up 16%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 A-Rated Stocks for Your August 2024 Buy List",
        "content": "This August will surely be an interesting time for the stock market. While the market historically has one of its weakest months in August, there’s some indication that A-rated stocks could indeed be set up for quite the rally this year.\n\nAccording to some new research that indicates a fascinating trend.\n\nFirst, let’s look at this historical perspective. Over the last decade, August has been the third-worst month for the S&P 500, which averages just a 0.1% gain in August. And over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 actually averages a 0.1% loss in the eighth month of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut then factor in an event that happens only every four years – the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nAccording to Dow Jones research, the S&P 500 actually does quite well in the August before a presidential election, growing 1.3% on average. That’s the fifth-best month for the index in a year during a presidential election – so while it’s not off-the-charts good, it’s better than average.\n\nEven better, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite performs even better in August of presidential election years, growing 3.2% on average.\n\nSo, while you may have the impulse to sit this month out, historically speaking there’s plenty of opportunity to succeed this month. You just have to know where to look. And I’ll always lean on the Portfolio Grader and A-rated stocks.\n\nHere are seven to consider this month.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Iphone 11 with the logo of Nvidia Corporation which is a company specialized in the development of graphic processing units. Nvidia stock, NVDA stock\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’m an unapologetic bull when it comes to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, which has been one of the most dynamic stocks on the market because of its important role in creating the most sought-after graphics processing units that power generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nNvidia rose from a company with a market capitalization of $470 billion just two years ago to one with a cap of $2.6 trillion. And that’s after the company lost nearly $500 billion in the last few weeks on some tech stock bearishness.\n\nBut you have to remember that Nvidia showed 262% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, and I expect another great quarter when it reports earnings later this month. And if you’re worried that Nvidia shares are down 6% over the last months – just stop.\n\nYes, Big Tech companies are working on making their own AI chips. But if nothing else that just means that growth deceleration risk is already well priced in when you consider Nvidia’s valuation. At least, when you consider NVDA’s current valuation.\n\nEven if Nvidia trends lower before its scheduled Aug. 28 earnings report, consider this an opportunity to buy an A-rated stock at a discount. Nvidia continues to carry an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding mobile phone with web page of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a top semiconductor stock as well, but of a different flavor. While Nvidia creates the GPUs, Supermicro builds the custom server architecture that is critical to allowing multiple GPUs to work together. And that’s important when using massive amounts of processing power to run large language model programs.\n\nSupermicro is also reportedly providing and assembling half the AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup run by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to compete with ChatGPT.\n\nThe company reported sales of $3.85 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nWhile shares are down below $700 – the lowest they’ve been in six months because of temporary weakness in tech stocks – Supermicro continues to capitalize on surging demand. I’m expecting it to deliver another year of solid returns by the time the sun sets on this calendar year.\n\nSMCI stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is more than just the biggest retailer on the planet. The Arkansas-based company is a true powerhouse that is a safe haven for investors as customers continue to look for ways to escape higher food prices.\n\nWalmart has over 10,800 locations, covering every U.S. state and over 20 countries. Its e-commerce business is becoming formidable as well, with 22% growth in U.S. sales in the first quarter, and 21% global e-commerce sales growth. Overall, Walmart grew its revenue by 6% overall in the quarter.\n\nWalmart keeps prices low because of its size – it creates enough in-house products that it can force name-brand companies to lower their prices as well to compete, and shoppers reap the benefits.\n\nWalmart stock is up 32% so far this year and I’m anticipating another strong quarter. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is another low-cost retailer, but it does it a little differently than Walmart. Costco operates 900 warehouse stores that offer everything from food to clothing and appliances.\n\nThe company’s $60 membership program encourages customer loyalty and provides a source of income. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, membership fees were $1.12 billion, making up a huge percentage of the company’s $1.68 billion in net income.\n\nOn top of that Costco is increasing the fee by $5 annually for basic memberships and $10 annually for executive memberships. That will keep Costco’s profits rolling in.\n\nSales in June were up 5.3%, with U.S. sales (up 5.6%) and Canada sales (up 5.2%) leading the way.\n\nCOST stock is up 24% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI think Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has a world of potential. The company is best known for making computers, laptops and mobile devices, but it’s leaning in hard on AI by operating a large server business that allows companies to upgrade their hardware to run AI applications.\n\nDell is building and selling servers that include Nvidia’s H100 GPU and Blackwell-generation chips. Its backlog of orders for AI servers increased 30% during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to $3.8 billion, and AI server sales rose 42% to $5.5 billion.\n\nDell saw its client solutions business grow by 3% to $12 billion, and I’m expecting that number to increase as Dell gains momentum in the AI space.\n\nDELL stock is up 41% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nUBS (UBS) Smartphone with Credit Suisse Bank (CS) logo on background of UBS Bank symbol blurred, Switzerland, March 18, 2023\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nUBS (NYSE:UBS) is a Swiss bank that offers an array of financial services in 50 countries. While it’s perhaps best known for global wealth management, UBS also provides personal banking, corporate banking and asset management.\n\nA year ago it acquired Credit Suisse Group, and by building on that expertise its now working on its first-ever ESG debt swap, which is a deal that allows a country to exchange existing debt with cheaper loans with savings that are tied to environmental protection.\n\nUBS is working with other firms to raise money for a $300 million debt swap for Barbados.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter included revenue of $12.7 billion, up from $8.7 billion a year ago. Profits were $1.7 billion and 52 cents per share versus $1.02 billion and 32 cents per share a year ago.\n\nUBS shows strong growth, although the stock price remains roughly even so far this year. It still gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you need proof that it’s possible to recover from even an awful mistake, then remember AT&T (NYSE:T). Just two years ago, the company was reeling after was forced to cut its dividend in half while spinning off WarnerMedia into a company now operating at Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nIt was the first time in 35 years that AT&T cut its vaunted dividend, but it was a necessary step for the company to emerge from the WarnerMedia mess and start paying off a mountain of debt.\n\nNow it’s 2024 and AT&T is recovering nicely. The dividend is solid at more than 5.5%. The balance sheet is better, as debt of $128.7 billion is an improvement from $157.6 billion at the start of 2022.\n\nAnd AT&T is seeing strong growth in its wireless business, which reported 593,000 net additions in the first quarter. Roughly 419,000 of those were retail postpaid phone additions. In the broadband segment, total fiber net additions were up 239,000.\n\nI think AT&T is well on its way, and the stock price shows it – up 16% this year. T stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had [short/long] position(s) in NVDA, SCMI and COST.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, an early indication of strong demand for AI chips even as a global tech selloff underlined growing doubts about the technology’s potential.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\n\nSales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.\n\nTSMC is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.\n\nThat was before worries about the global economic outlook prompted investors to cash out of some of the year’s biggest gainers, including the major tech companies at the heart of the AI boom. TSMC’s shares shed 10% of their value in one day, before recovering much of the drop as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.\n\nStill, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Research Reports for NVIDIA, Home Depot &amp; Vertex Pharmaceuticals",
        "content": "Thursday, August 8, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX), as well as a micro-cap stock Moving iMage Technologies, Inc. (MITQ).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares were hit hard in the recent market downturn, but the stock appears to have regained its earlier momentum in recent days; the stock is now up +109.5% in the year-to-date period vs. +9.3% gain for the S&P 500 index. Driving the stock's strong performance is the company's leadership position in the AI-centric chips. \r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. \r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Home Depot have gained +4.3% over the past year against the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry’s gain of +5.0%. The company has been witnessing benefits from the execution of the “One Home Depot” investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience. \r\n\r\nThe interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. It on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem. \r\n\r\nHowever, the company's top and bottom-lines declined year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2024. Results were impacted by a deflation in lumber and copper prices and pressures from softness in big-ticket discretionary categories, which weighed on comps. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here >>>)\r\n\r\nVertex Pharmaceuticals shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+14.5% vs. -6.0%). The company’s cystic franchise sales continue to grow, driven by higher sales of Trikafta/Kaftrio in younger age groups. Its one-shot gene therapy, Casgevy, was approved for two blood disorders in multiple regions, which diversified its commercial opportunity. \r\n\r\nVertex has additional near-term launches planned — suzetrigine in acute pain and vanza triple in CF. It is rapidly progressing its mid- and earlier-stage pipeline, with multiple milestones expected in the second half of the year. \r\n\r\nThe Alpine acquisition has added povetacicept, which Vertex believes has a “pipeline in a product” potential. However, Vertex’s dependence on just the CF franchise for revenues is a concern. CF sales are slightly slowing down.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Moving iMage Technologies’ have underperformed the Zacks Technology Services industry over the past six months (-2.1% vs. -27.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $6.11 million is witnessing supply chain disruptions, competition from OTT platforms and regulatory compliance costs pose risks.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Moving iMage Technologies' new share repurchase program, effective until Jun 30, 2024, signals confidence in financial stability and growth. This follows a previous program where 6.3% of shares were repurchased. \r\n\r\nMiT's significant contract win with Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and expansion into high-margin SaaS and subscription-based products like MiTranslator and CineQC promise higher margins and recurring revenues. Diversifying into live entertainment and esports markets mitigates cinema industry cyclicality. \r\n\r\nOperating in a growing market, MiT is well-positioned to capitalize on technological advancements and increased demand for high-quality cinema experiences. Financial stability, as evidenced by $5.9 million in cash, supports growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Moving iMage Technologies here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

More than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, according to Bloomberg analysis.\n\n\"I think that for 2025... things are fairly well set,\" said Chkaiban. \"We know roughly how much they [hyperscalers] expect to grow cap-ex.

        "title": "3 Stock Split Opportunities Investors Should Pay Close Attention To",
        "content": "Stock splits, once rare, are roaring back into focus for traders and investors alike. In January, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) became the latest company to announce a three-for-one stock split followed by Williams-Sonoma’s (NYSE:WSM) two-for-one split. This trend has continued, with plenty of other stock split opportunities worth paying attention to.\n\nCompared to other tech cycles, like the tech bubble in the 1990s, stock splits are rare. By the mid-2000s, stock splits dropped dramatically, and nearly ceased after the 2008 financial crisis. Institutional investors diminished their importance as the dollar value of certain trades tend to not matter as much as with the retail investor crowd. Recent stock splits announced by big companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) make stock ownership to be more accessible to the public and broaden out investor bases. That’s good for companies and retail investors alike.\n\nHowever, a stock split does not necessarily impact the company’s overall future performance or fundamentals. Investors will simply hold more shares at a lower price. Despite some splits this year not boosting stock prices significantly, three companies are worth watching for potential splits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) A chart of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) logo with a Bitcoin\n\nSource: JOCA_PH / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently reporting its Q2 2024 results, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) now holds over 226,500 Bitcoin (BTC-USD) that are valued 70% above its cost basis. The company introduced a new KPI, “BTC Yield,” aiming for 4% to 8% annual returns over the next three years. CEO Phong Le noted optimism about growing Bitcoin adoption and increasing global demand for its cloud-based business intelligence and artificial intelligence software, which saw strong double-digit growth in subscription revenue and billings.\n\nMicroStrategy’s heavy investment in Bitcoin has led the company to hold 214,400 Bitcoins. This factor alone likely impacts its stock more than its stock split. According to other history records, MSTR and BTC prices move together. If one surges, the other surges as well. Recent digital asset issues and losses that reached $191.6 million exceeded the $115.2 million revenue in the last quarter. This emphasizes the influence of Bitcoin on MicroStrategy.\n\nMoreover, the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split recently. The split will take place through a stock dividend. The distribution will happen on Aug. 7. Split-adjusted basis trading will begin the day after on Aug. 8.\n\nThe upcoming stock split for MicroStrategy is highly anticipated. With MSTR up 156% this year, buying now may be risky. Investors may want to consider owning MSTR stock now, as analysts have price targets for it ranging from $210 to $2000.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce a small-cap stock, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn’t one anymore as it has a $29 billion market valuation. Impressively, SMCI stock saw a 246.2% surge last year and 188.2% in 2024 so far. Before it entered the S&P 500 and later Nasdaq 100, SMCI peaked at $1,229 in February. While stock splits don’t alter company value, they often signal management’s confidence. With its recent gains, Supermicro, as it is known, might consider a split to sustain its valuation.\n\nThe stock surged 300% in 2024 due to high demand for its AI servers and liquid-cooled solutions. Moreover, it impressed investors as it gained 1,000% in 2023 due to the AI trend. The company now has strong fundamentals that can back up investors during market turbulence.\n\nSupermicro recently reported an impressive Q3 report. Revenue reached $3.85 billion, as net income improved fourfold, reaching $402 million. Wall Street is strongly bullish for SMCI and its strong performance. This could lead its first-ever stock split this year.\n\nSupermicro capitalized on AI with its efficient server designs, boosting revenues and market share. Trading at 48.8 times earnings and 24.8 times 2025 estimates, its growth mirrors Nvidia’s, partly due to using Nvidia’s chips. Future growth will depend on the broader AI accelerator market.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), an enterprise software provider, saw significant growth due to AI’s rise. In Q2, it reported a 25% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue to $2.54 billion, driven by its GenAI cloud platform. Total revenue rose 24%, with earnings at $3.13 per share. The company expects a 20% rise in subscription revenue for the current quarter and 22% for the year.\n\nCompanies often split their stock when shares rise sharply, as they seen as expensive to retail investors. Although a split doesn’t affect company value, lower prices attract new investors. Since its 2012 IPO, ServiceNow’s stock has surged 2,970%, with a recent 77% increase driven by AI trends. At $755 per share and with no prior splits, ServiceNow might consider a split to align with tech peers and capitalize on further growth.\n\nServiceNow’s Now Assist, powered by Microsoft Co-Pilot, boosts workflows with AI tools. In 2023, revenue surged 24%, with a 33% rise in $1M+ contracts and a 427% earnings increase. With the recent quarter surpassing estimates, this prompts a higher subscription outlook and a “strong buy” rating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed discussion and see the 5 Most Industrialized Countries in Asia here.\n\nCurrent State of Development and Outlook of Asia\n\nAsia has observed phenomenal growth in industrialization and manufacturing, particularly in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong domestic demand and export growth in electronics. Developing Asia's growth forecast for 2024 is revised up to 5.0% which also speaks volumes about the highly stable performances across multiple sectors. Countries like China, with its recovery in services consumption and strong exports, have played a key role in this growth. Moreover, the strong performance of sectors like construction and public investment in countries like Azerbaijan and the Kyrgyz Republic has further fueled this expansion.\n\nThe region’s inflation is also on a positive trajectory and is forecasted to ease from 3.3% in 2023 to 2.9% in 2024 and will stabilize at 3.0% in 2025. This decline is attributed to stable exchange rates and tight monetary policies in key economies. For example, Kazakhstan's inflation rate slowed from 18.5% in early 2023 to 9.0% in the same period of 2024. Similarly, Armenia experienced a 0.8% deflation in early 2024. Despite the positive outlook, the region faces several downside risks, including geopolitical tensions and property market fragility in China.\n\nSpeaking of China, it is worth highlighting that it is Asia’s most powerful economy in 2024. Beyond Asia, South Africa and Morocco are the most industrialized countries in Africa.\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024\n\nPerformance of Manufacturing in Asia in 2024 and the Growing Importance of South Asia\n\nAsia's manufacturing sector continues to exhibit strong performance as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) exceeded 50 for seven consecutive months. This consistent growth confirms a resilient industrial base across the region. For instance, China's PMI for June stood at 51.2, while Japan's reached 52.4. Moreover, Southeast Asian economies are also contributing largely to this growth. Vietnam's PMI hit 53.1 and similarly, Thailand and Indonesia reported PMIs of 52.7 and 51.8, respectively. The region's manufacturers are capitalizing on technological advancements and increased foreign investment.\n\nSoutheast Asia has become a key hub for businesses diversifying supply chains which is truly driven by the \"China Plus One\" strategy. With the growing US-China tensions, companies are shifting operations to the region to mitigate risks associated with heavy reliance on China. This strategy has largely boosted foreign direct investment (FDI) into ASEAN countries, with FDI rising to $236 billion in 2023, up from an annual average of $190 billion between 2020 and 2022. Countries like Vietnam and Indonesia are benefiting the most from this shift.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, Vietnam has appeared as an integral manufacturing location, especially for tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which now assembles MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches in the country. Vietnam's competitive labor costs and extensive free-trade agreements have made it a preferred destination for supply chains. In addition to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung has established a major research and development presence in Vietnam.\n\nMoreover, Malaysia and Indonesia are also seeing tremendous growth. Malaysia, with its skilled labour force in semiconductor manufacturing, has attracted investments from companies like Intel and GlobalFoundries. Meanwhile, Indonesia is capitalizing on its abundant resources of copper, nickel, cobalt, and bauxite to develop an integrated electric vehicle (EV) hub.\n\nTech Industry Giants Tapping Into Asian Economies\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding its presence in Asia with major investments in Indonesia and Singapore. In April 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced plans to build a $200 million artificial intelligence center in Surakarta, Indonesia in partnership with Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison. This facility aims to enhance local telecommunications infrastructure and develop digital talent. The initiative follows Indosat's integration of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) next-generation chip architecture, Blackwell.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s partnership with Singapore's telecom provider Singtel further confirms its regional ambitions. By deploying AI capabilities in data centers across the region, Singtel aims to provide businesses access to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s cutting-edge AI computing power without the need for heavy infrastructure investments. Southeast Asia has indeed emerged as a major revenue driver for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOn the other hand, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is making a strategic investment to automate chip packaging with the involvement of 14 Japanese companies, as reported by Nikkei Asia. Led by Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) Japan president Kunimasa Suzuki, this collaboration aims to develop a working prototype by 2028. The US chipmaker plans to invest tens of billions of yen in this initiative by capitalizing on Japan’s substantial 30% share in global chipmaking equipment. By advancing front-end processes like circuit formation, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) seeks to enhance back-end applications, such as chip stacking, to boost overall chip performance. This decision is made to reduce reliance on manual assembly in low-cost regions and shift manufacturing to the US and Japan. The effort is timely, as China currently holds over a third of global back-end chipmaking capacity.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

We chose the value-added manufacturing metric as it measures the contribution of manufacturing to the overall economy, and a higher value indicates a stronger and more developed manufacturing sector, which is a core component of industrialization. We chose the employment metric because it represents the proportion of the workforce employed in industrial sectors. It provides insights into the labor market structure and the importance of industrial activities in the employment landscape. A higher percentage indicates a larger industrial workforce, suggesting a more industrialized economy.\n\nWe ranked each country from highest to lowest for both metrics, with a rank of 1 indicating the highest manufacturing output or highest employment in industry. To determine the overall level of industrialization, we assigned a weight of 0.8 to the manufacturing output rank and 0.2 to the employment in the industry rank. We then calculated a weighted average rank for each country. The countries are presented in ascending order of their weighted average rank, where 1 indicates the highest level of industrialization and 17 the lowest.\n\nPlease note that there are three transcontinental countries on the list i.e., Egypt, Turkey and Russia.\n\n20. Qatar\n\nManufacturing (Output) Rank: 21\n\nEmployment % by Industry Rank: 2\n\nWeighted Average Rank: 17\n\nQatar has aimed to diversify its economy through industrialization, with the manufacturing sector predominantly consisting of large firms with mixed state and foreign private ownership.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Remember that time the metaverse was a big deal and would change the way we worked, played and interacted with one another? Yeah, good times.\n\nUnfortunately for companies that went all-in on the idea, living your life totally connected to the online world hasn’t gone according to plan. While the virtual hellscape is not dead, it does give off a death rattle.\n\nMost people did not even know what the metaverse was until Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Despite its misnamed alternate reality division Reality Labs losing $50 billion since 2020, the social media giant continues to throw billions more into the sinkhole. Investors were worried it was going to repeat the mistake when it noticeably shifted its attention to artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile AI has sucked all the oxygen out of the room so that hardly anyone even discusses the metaverse anymore, there are still companies tied to it. And because the world has seemingly moved beyond this virtual world, investors should be wary of the three metaverse stocks to sell below.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree years ago, Unity Software (NYSE: U) was going to power the metaverse. It even acquired Metaverse Technologies for $45 million because of its ability to enhance 3D computer-aided design visualization performance.\n\nBecause the Unity Engine is a leader in virtual and augmented reality, not to mention gaming, it was responsible for powering most of the world’s mobile games. Yet as the gaming market cooled off and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) changed its privacy policies that impacted Unity’s advertising business, U stock went into a deep freeze, too.\n\nUnity Software lost 86% of its value over the last three years and over 92% from its late-2021 peak. Although the company is still an important component of the gaming market as well as in the VR and AR worlds, the metaverse is doing nothing to help.\n\nThe software specialist is losing ground to Epic Games Unreal Engine, it is downsizing its business still and there are few prospects for turning a profit anytime soon. For all the promise Unity Software held with driving the metaverse forward, it is now a prime metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline gaming platform Roblox (NASDAQ: RBLX) has fared only a little better than Unity Software, losing 72% of its value from the height of its 2021 valuation. Shares are down 16% so far this year, though they had been much lower.\n\nIts immersive gaming platform remains entwined with the metaverse, which is what is holding it back. Because there is little development in education, industrial usage, or services, in the metaverse there seems no catalyst to fire up growth. While it can attract users to its gaming platform, as noted previously that market has largely stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond-quarter daily average users rose 21% to 79.5 million and monthly unique payers rose 22% to 16.5 million. So the site is still able to attract players. But bookings, which refers to sales of Roblox’s virtual currency, rose less than revenue. That indicates overall slower growth is coming in the future.\n\nRoblox also still generates losses. They only improved slightly to $205.8 million from $282.7 million last year. The gaming platform still has a tough slog ahead of it and it trades at a premium valuation, making it a metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Illustration of the metaverse. A young boy wearing a VR headset is in the metaverse.\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTypically buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a way to spread out risk while capturing all of a sector’s growth potential. In the case of Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA: METV), it was a way to absorb all the risk of the metaverse, as it is proving to be more fad than trend.\n\nThe ETF’s stock is down 20% in 2024 and it sits almost 30% below its all-time high. With Roblox being its top holding, representing over 9% of the portfolio, and Unity Software a top-10 pick, the only reason it is not faring worse is because it also owns a handful of Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple, Meta and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) account for over 18% of its holdings. Yet other than Meta, the other two are only tangentially related to the metaverse.\n\nA look at its holdings also shows why you can’t just go by an ETF’s name before you buy. It owns a collection of top chipmakers, cloud stocks and gaming companies. There are actually very few metaverse stocks in the portfolio.\n\nEven so, Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has vastly underperformed the S&P 500. While it sports a reasonable 0.59% expense ratio, its inability to capitalize on the tech industry’s growth while avoiding the pitfalls of its true metaverse stocks makes it an ETF to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That fund would conceivably allow investors to capture the boom in relatively smaller tech firms while avoiding the big behemoths.\n\nBlackRock’s filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission come at a time of intense debate over stock-market concentration risk, which has been brewing as just a handful of equities — dubbed the Magnificent Seven — led the charge higher in the first half of the year.\n\nThe seven companies — Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. — accounted for the majority of gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, which sparked fears among market-watchers that those same firms would also drag the market lower when they sell off, something that’s proven prescient in recent days.\n\n“It speaks to the concentration dichotomy in the market,” said Athanasios Psarofagis, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “You’re either all-in on a few names or avoiding them altogether.”\n\nTech stocks staged a speedy ascent in the first half of the year, with the Nasdaq 100 posting double-digit gains through the end of June thanks to surges in the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft, as well as other firms tied to artificial intelligence. Over the past month, however, they’ve experienced some of the biggest declines within a market-wide selloff that’s dragged down other asset classes as well.\n\nDuring the first-half rally, many strategies tied to the big-tech behemoths became popular with investors. For instance, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (ticker MAGS) posted healthy inflows, said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. Assets in the fund, which gives exposure to the seven largest companies, have grown to around $600 million from $35 million at the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It seems like issuers are either a) leaning into the concentration aspect or b) attempting to provide solutions away from it, and iShares, just being the leader in ETFs, is there to provide whatever solution investors want,” said Sohn, referring to BlackRock’s ETF unit.\n\nApart from MAGS, other exchange-traded products offer variations on big-tech exposure.\n\nThe Direxion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2X Shares (QQQU) and the Direxion Daily Concentrated QS Bear 1x Shares (QQQD) offer leveraged and inverse performance of an index tracking the Magnificent Seven, while two exchange-traded notes from REX Shares offer exposure to the NYSE FANG+ Index. Invesco, meanwhile, has a S&P 500 Top 50 ETF that’s gotten inflows of $1.3 billion this year.\n\nAlthough there are already products out there tapping into the big-tech theme, there’s still room for new iterations, said Dave Mazza, chief executive officer at Roundhill Investments, which runs MAGS.\n\n“Anytime you see the success of a product, other fund providers look to see how they can enter the space,” he said. “Being precise is beneficial, but there’s space for people looking for different measures of precision.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "$900 Billion Wiped Off Nvidia Stock Even as AI Spending Ramps Up",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- On the surface, Nvidia Corp.’s $900 billion selloff since its June record would suggest the artificial intelligence spending boom that propelled it there is cooling. But the undercurrents tell a far less dire story.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\n\nMicrosoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — together accounting for more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue — have all said they will keep investing billions into AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Super Micro Computer Inc. — which makes data center servers used in AI — told investors it expects to generate up to $30 billion in sales over the next year, blowing away analyst expectations. And yet, Nvidia — the prime beneficiary of AI spending — has seen its shares tumble 27% in less than two months.\n\n“Nobody reduced numbers and said things are not working with AI or we’re taking a pause on AI,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC. “It’s just that people are very nervous.”\n\nInvestors had already been rotating out of expensive technology stocks for weeks, instead snapping up everything from small-capitalization stocks to value plays, utilities and real estate companies. Last week’s weaker-than-anticipated jobs report further fueled fears that the US economy may be slowing faster than anticipated.\n\nThat uncertain macroeconomic backdrop may be adding extra jitters and weighing more heavily on Nvidia and its peers than quarterly earnings, Williams said. The move lower was exacerbated by the unwinding of global carry trades, something many across Wall Street have pointed to as the trigger for the recent surge in market volatility.\n\nAt the same time, Big Tech companies largely failed to convince investors during the earnings season that their spending on AI is translating to more sales and bigger profits. “We haven’t yet seen a way to monetize AI, so the return on that spending is unclear. The question is, how long can this continue?” said Srini Pajjuri, managing director and senior research analyst at Raymond James.\n\nA lack of catalysts ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report at the end of August means that the narrative for AI chipmakers isn’t likely to change in the coming weeks, according to Pajjuri. “That will make it challenging for these stocks to work right now,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has also faced other recent challenges. The company hit engineering snags in the development of two new advanced chips, Bloomberg reported this week, while some investors are also concerned about the potential for more competition. Many of Nvidia’s biggest clients, including Alphabet and Microsoft, are developing their own chips to use in AI computing. While it may take years for those products to be ready, they could take market share.\n\nNvidia isn’t the only AI-related name that’s been pummeled in the widespread drawdown. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has fallen more than 25% from a July peak. And despite Super Micro Computer’s strong outlook, its shares slumped 20% on Wednesday after investors were disappointed by its gross margin number.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia shares have doubled in value this year, even after the recent slump. There are still signs of solid demand for AI chips in the near-term, and Wall Street is largely bullish on the technology. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. spiked when it reported earnings in late July that included an upbeat revenue forecast citing increased demand for AI accelerators.\n\nAnd it was perhaps just a matter of time before some of Nvidia’s shine had to come off. The shares were trading at about 44 times forward earnings in mid-June, a significant premium to the Nasdaq 100 at about 26 times on the same day. After the recent selloff, the chipmaker is trading at about 30 times — potentially making them more attractive to long-term investors again.\n\n“Nothing has changed fundamentally with these companies other than they probably got a little bit ahead of themselves,” said Ken Mahoney, president and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nCathie Wood scooped up shares of tech firms caught in the crushing market rout, just as her flagship fund sank to a new 2024 low. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the parent of CNN and TNT, posted a second-quarter charge of $9.1 billion after writing down the value of its traditional TV networks. Tokyo Electron Ltd. raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year to March after reporting a better-than-expected surge in sales. Malaysia is gaining more heft in the global supply chain as Infineon Technologies AG opens a major semiconductor manufacturing complex in the country, the Southeast Asian nation’s leader said. India’s Adani Group is reworking its digital strategy that includes bolstering online payment through partnerships as Gautam Adani’s conglomerate looks to make its superapp an essential part of Indians’ lives.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock Going to $150? Here's Why 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.",
        "content": "Markets started the week with investors all around the globe running for cover. In any sell-off, some of the hardest-hit stocks are growth stocks that had run up the most. That includes advanced chip maker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nEven with the market bouncing back some this week, the high-flying stock is now down about 25% from its record closing price in mid-June. But one Wall Street analyst thinks the plunge in Nvidia shares creates a great opportunity for investors.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer just released his latest research note saying investors could gain about 50% from Nvidia stock if he's right about the stock reaching $150 per share.\n\nSelling on Nvidia rumors\n\nThe selling of Nvidia stock was exacerbated after rumors circulated over the weekend that a defect discovered in its next-generation Blackwell chip will cause a delay in its rollout later this year. That chip and its architecture are expected to be very popular among customers looking to get the highest computing power available for artificial intelligence (AI) plans.\n\nBut Oppenheimer's Schafer thinks there's no need for investor concern even if those rumors are true. That's because any delay rolling out Blackwell will be used to help supply the excessive demand for Nvidia's existing H100 AI chips.\n\nIn his research note, Schafer wrote, \"Nvidia's competitive position remains sound, and we don't expect any share loss from a minor delay. ... We see Nvidia as best positioned in AI, benefiting from full stack AI hardware/software solutions.\"\n\nSchafer's comments make complete sense. All signs point to a big gap between Nvidia's current chip capacity and surging demand. While competitors will help fill some of that gap, Nvidia should be happy to continue to sell its existing chips. Blackwell will just boost those sales even further. That makes the correction in Nvidia stock an opportunity to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy as Nvidia Sputters",
        "content": "This week, shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) closed more than 20% below their previous high, wiping out over $600 billion in market value. If it were a stock exchange, Nvidia would now be officially considered a bear market.\n\nThe problem comes down to the high costs of artificial intelligence. Over the past several weeks, companies from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have reported rising spending on AI efforts with little growth to show for it. Computing performance has become exponentially more expensive to achieve – as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly noted in a 2022 speech – and people simply aren’t willing to pay up. OpenAI has not raised retail prices for ChatGPT in more than a year, despite GPT-4 having roughly six times more parameters than its predecessor and costing at least 20 times more to train, according to experts.\n\nLarger tech firms are feeling pressures to rein in spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s important to note that Nvidia is still the king of the AI hill. Joey Frenette notes in an InvestorPlace.com article this week that once the dust settles, Nvidia will be ready to go again. My own $1,600 target price for shares by 2027 remains intact.\n\nBut sagging momentum means weaker AI plays are now facing a reckoning. Studies have shown that markets have become more momentum-driven since the mid-1990s, and the effect has become significantly stronger over the past several years. We’re already seeing smaller AI firms like SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) and BigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI) down 50% or more from this year’s highs.\n\nMeanwhile, some surprising tech stocks are now on the mend. These “hidden” AI plays have distanced themselves from Nvidia, whether by operating in a separate industry or projecting a more conservative image. Writers at InvestorPlace.com have highlighted three AI stocks to buy — each from companies they believe will continue rising despite weakness in other AI plays.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first company I want to tell you about this week is pretty much everything Nvidia is not… at least from a public relations standpoint. The 1999 spinoff of Hewlett-Packard has remained below the radar by sticking to its knitting. Broadcom’s CEO prefers to communicate through blog posts, which he has used for everything from communicating corporate strategy to putting out fires. And it also helps that most of its products, like RAID controllers and ethernet adapters, are not nearly as exciting to the regular investor as the graphic processing units (GPUs) that Nvidia creates.\n\nNevertheless, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has quietly assembled one of the best portfolios of computer hardware and software in the industry, which it has used to stay ahead of the AI revolution. The company is a leader in the high-performance switches and routers that increasingly large hyperscale data centers require. And its recent acquisition of VMware gives it new markets to cross-sell into.\n\nChris MacDonald highlights these facts and notes that investor fatigue with other megacap chip names appears to be boosting Broadcom’s appeal.\n\nCurrently well-positioned for more growth, AVGO stock is seeing strong growth courtesy of its AI and cloud computing exposure. The company’s strong R&D investments and recurring revenue from infrastructure software support a solid business model. Additionally, Broadcom’s recent VMware acquisition is expected to boost growth by integrating key AI tools. Broadcom’s strategy to lead in critical markets with high switching costs supports a positive long-term investment outlook.\n\nBroadcom also has momentum on its side. Shares have fallen by less than half of what Nvidia has seen, and strong earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are a net positive. Unlike Nvidia, Broadcom does not compete directly against AMD.\n\nPerhaps best of all, Broadcom’s shares remain reasonably priced, trading at just 25 times trailing earnings. That gives shares upside potential from re-rating as well as from earnings growth.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have long marched to a different beat. Monthly returns of the broad-based Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) have a lower correlation with Nvidia (0.50 over the past five years) and semiconductors (0.62 vs. SOXX) than to indexes like the S&P 500 (0.73) and the Russell 3000 (0.75).\n\nOne particular cybersecurity company is now taking that truth to an entirely new level: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\nOn July 19, thousands of users worldwide suddenly found themselves unable to log into their Windows PCs. Thousands of flights were canceled. Hospitals were forced to pause non-urgent visits. And dozens of TV stations found themselves unable to broadcast. Though security experts at CrowdStrike quickly identified and patched the problem, the damage was done. CrowdStrike’s shares have now fallen 40% since June, for reasons entirely unrelated to Nvidia’s recent selloff.\n\nLegendary investor Louis Navellier now sees this as a phenomenal opportunity to buy one of the world’s highest-quality cybersecurity companies. In a recent update in his free InvestorPlace.com e-letter, he outlines why CrowdStrike is now a great buy:\n\nClearly, shares of CrowdStrike got hit harder than Amazon did during its outages. But AWS is notorious for crashes and outages while CrowdStrike is not…\n\nI should also mention that CrowdStrike has a strong earnings surprise history, as it topped analysts’ earnings estimates in the past four quarters. Earnings estimates have been upped slightly over the past three months, so another earnings surprise could be in the cards…\n\nIt should also continue to benefit from the AI Revolution. Artificial intelligence relies on acquiring massive amounts of training data, which benefits large firms like CrowdStrike. These incumbents can “see” more threats thanks to their customer base, and so it creates a virtuous cycle. Larger companies create more powerful AI systems, which attracts more new users, and so on. It’s also important to note that one solution can get rolled out to every customer.\n\nEssentially, tech firms routinely face outages. Amazon’s cloud computing unit has gone down multiple times over the past several years, affecting hundreds… if not thousands… of customers worldwide. Cybersecurity firms like Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) are also repeat offenders.\n\nMarkets have simply grown accustomed to these temporary failures and allow incidents to pass without much of a selloff.\n\nThat will eventually become the case for CrowdStrike, which is likely worth closer to $300 per share (it’s now trading around $222). The company will offer short-term discounts to customers and see its insurance rates go up. And a year from now, the financial impact of the July 19 incident will have largely passed. The stock is a “Buy” in Louis’s book.\n\nPlease note that CrowdStrike will likely take several quarters to fully recover; much of the financial impact from lower customer growth and discounts have not yet been reflected in analyst estimates, making downward revisions likely. So, as well this week, Chris MacDonald chooses 3 cybersecurity stocks that could be much better picks, especially for those investing with a shorter horizon.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, longtime Sunday Digest readers will be familiar with ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), a company that turned from an IT systems recording firm into an AI leader that simplifies and automates entire enterprise workflows. The company’s Now Platform serves as a single location where different corporate departments can build, monitor and optimize no-code automation. Bolt-on acquisitions have since added additional features.\n\nIt’s an incredible product. Roughly 85% of the Fortune 500 use ServiceNow, and Gartner ranks the platform as a leader in enterprise low-code application platforms. Whereas Nvidia’s chips might be a cost sink to their customers, ServiceNow’s platform is designed to save its customers money.\n\nThat’s why ServiceNow’s shares have risen in the past month, rather than fall in lockstep with other AI companies. Investors are beginning to consider the costs of AI development, and ServiceNow provides a part of the solution.\n\nA recent earnings report highlights this fact. As Joey Frenette recently writes at InvestorPlace.com, ServiceNow is becoming a strong pick for those seeking AI upside beyond the usual plays like Nvidia:\n\nServiceNow didn’t just beat expectations, it knocked one out of the ballpark, sending NOW stock higher by double digits. With ServiceNow at new highs, there’s a brighter spotlight shined on AI. The company’s AI platform could easily gain further momentum going into year’s end as firms look to harness the power of their business data.\n\nWith the recent acquisition of German AI search firm Raytion, ServiceNow looks like one of the top enterprise software stocks to watch if you’re looking for the AI boom to lift the relatively affordable software names.\n\nFrenette also identifies Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) as strong alternatives. Costs of AI are rising, and companies that help contain them are succeeding.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOGL).

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks fell sharply in recent days, pressured by a combination of macroeconomic headwinds and disappointing earnings results amid high expectations.\n\nAccording to Citi analysts, consensus estimates declined by 11% during earnings season, primarily due to downside from Intel (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:INTC), GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:GFS), Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MCHP), and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:NXPI).\n\nThis decline is attributed to slower-than-expected analog inventory replenishment and downside risk from the automotive end market, which constitutes 14% of semiconductor demand.\n\nHowever, the analysts remain bullish on the sector, stating that \"the main reasons we are positive – AI and memory strength – remain intact.\"\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:MU) remains Citi’s Top Pick.

Citi expects DRAM pricing to rise 62% year-over-year in 2024, noting that DRAM pricing appears set to increase by mid-teens in 3Q24, surpassing expectations of a low double-digit increase.\n\nCiti’s semiconductor analysts recently revised his 2024 DRAM pricing forecast from a 53% year-over-year increase to 62% due to limited supply growth and memory makers’ capacity allocation to high-bandwidth memory (HBM).\n\nDespite weaknesses in the automotive and industrial end markets, demand trends from the three largest end markets – PCs, handsets, and servers, which together account for 61% of semiconductor demand – are relatively healthy.\n\nMicron indicated that inventory in the traditional data center market improved in the first half of 2024 and foresees growth in the second half.\n\n\"We expect upside to guidance when Micron reports earnings in September,” analysts noted. The memory chipmaker's shares fell over 30% in the past month, returning to the lowest levels since February.\n\nOverall, Citi analysts forecast semiconductor sales growth of 14% in 2024, reaching $603.2 billion. They anticipate roughly seasonal growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, following above-seasonal growth in the second quarter.\n\nAlso, they project units excluding discretes to increase by 3% year-over-year and average selling prices (ASPs) to rise by 13% year-over-year.\n\nApart from Micorn, the bank’s other Buy-rated semiconductor stocks include AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), Microchip Technology, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), andKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC).\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCiti is doubling down on this chip stock, urges investors to buy the dip\n\nCyberArk shares leap 6% as Q2 earnings top estimates, guidance raised\n\nApellis Pharmaceuticals shares surge after study results\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Nvidia 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the king of artificial intelligence (AI) investing for now, but it doesn't mean it will stay in that position forever. Right now, it's on top because its clients buy thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) and place them in giant data centers to produce and train AI models.\n\nEventually, this demand will decline as companies build out their capacity, making way for the next wave of AI investments. As a result, I think there are three companies that could be worth more than Nvidia five years from now. They are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Although the climb won't be easy, I think they can displace Nvidia.\n\nTaiwan Semi will win regardless of which company sits atop the AI throne\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor may be a surprise pick here, as it's significantly smaller than Nvidia right now (Nvidia is valued at $2.6 trillion versus TSMC's $775 billion). However, some tailwinds will push TSMC higher.\n\nFirst, Taiwan Semiconductor is more diversified than Nvidia. Nvidia is basically a one-trick pony with its GPUs and products that complement them. Taiwan Semi may also be a one-trick pony because all it does is produce chips, but the use case for those chips is so wide that it ends up being diversified. For example, Apple is one of Taiwan Semi's largest customers and could see a huge demand ramp-up soon as Apple Intelligence is only available on the latest generation of iPhones.\n\nSecond, TSMC is working on its 2nm (nanometer) chips, which are capable of the same performance as its 3nm predecessors, except that they consume 25% to 30% less power. That's a huge performance gain, and it will drive the next generation of hardware used to process AI models.\n\nHowever, will the next generation of AI models be run on Nvidia hardware? Not necessarily.\n\nApple Intelligence isn't using Nvidia GPUs. Instead, it's using Alphabet's tensor processing units (TPUs). While this may come as a surprise to some investors, it shouldn't. Nvidia GPUs are fantastic at being flexible and processing various workloads. However, there are more efficient ways to train AI models if the workload is set up properly. That's why Alphabet's TPUs can be a better choice than Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nFor most of its customers, these TPUs can only be accessed through Google Cloud. As programmers get better at setting up AI models for efficient calculations, this will shift the workloads from GPUs to hardware specifically designed for processing AI, like TPUs. So, all of the technology that TSMC is innovating may end up being used in products like TPUs instead of GPUs, which could cause Alphabet to rise and Nvidia to tumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut how does Amazon fit in?\n\nAmazon and Alphabet are remarkably similar businesses\n\nWhile most know Amazon as its dominant commerce platform, it's actually the largest provider of cloud computing infrastructure globally. Like Alphabet, Amazon also has purpose-built custom chips to optimize AI training.\n\nIt will benefit from the same tailwinds that will push Alphabet higher in the next few years, except that the effect may be even more profound as Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes up a higher percentage of Amazon's operating profits than Alphabet's Google Cloud.\n\nFurthermore, Amazon's commerce business is still doing well. This is another similarity to Alphabet, as Alphabet has huge growth drivers in the AI space, but its advertising business continues to print money. As Amazon's commerce business continues to grow and become more efficient, Amazon will turn into an even larger business, potentially surpassing Nvidia within five years.\n\nWhile Nvidia has undoubtedly won the first round of AI investing, there are still many to go. As companies shift to load-specific hardware, I think companies like Amazon and Alphabet will succeed, bringing Taiwan Semiconductor (the maker of these chips) along with them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Oracle Stock Outlook: Why ORCL Investors Can Expect More Upside",
        "content": "Enterprise software and cloud giant Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has witnessed impressive momentum in its stock price over the past nine months. Despite lagging behind the S&P 500 last year, it has more than made up for it with a 21.3% jump year-to-date (YTD). The results may have surprised many, considering its missed top-line estimates in the past three quarters. Despite recent sluggish growth rates, the excitement around its backlog and recent breakthrough AI deals points to more upside ahead. Additionally, the recent dip in its stock price makes Oracle an attractive buy.\n\nOracle stock was relatively laggard compared to its peers in the AI and cloud computing sectors. However, recent reports indicate superb progress in both realms, with Oracle expected to benefit from synergies in cloud and AI. Therefore, despite the recent bullish momentum, there’s plenty of reason to believe that Oracle will continue notching new highs.\n\nWith that said, let’s delve deeper into why Oracle is poised to be a clear winner in the cloud and AI race.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe AI Partnership Wave: OpenAI and Beyond The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA post-earnings dip was on the cards for Oracle after posting fourth-quarter (Q4) revenue and earnings misses, but the opposite occurred. Its impressive forward projections for double-digit expansion in fiscal year (FY) 2025 and a series of major AI deals overshadowed the shortfalls, significantly increasing investor confidence.\n\nPerhaps the biggest of those deals was with OpenAI to provide additional cloud capacity, despite the generative AI pioneer’s relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This was one of 30 major AI deals Oracle signed in Q4, with its remaining performance obligation surging 44% to nearly $100 billion. Those 30 new AI contracts were worth over $12 billion this quarter alone, significantly adding to its bull case.\n\nFollowing the OpenAI deal, Piper Sandler deemed Oracle a “high conviction idea” in enterprise software despite the sluggishness in the AI space. OpenAI will now leverage Oracle’s massive database technologies and scalable Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to advance its lofty AI endeavors. Piper Sandler expects the deal to attract more high-profile collaborations, enhancing Oracle’s market competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, CEO Safra Catz announced a multi-cloud partnership with Google in a similar deal. The partnership will integrate Oracle’s powerful database services within Google Cloud across ten regions. Therefore, with such high-profile collaborations, Oracle stands to become a foundational player in the AI infrastructure landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloud and AI: Fueling Oracle’s Next Growth Frontier The logo for Oracle Corp (ORCL) is seen on the side of a tall glass building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle’s top line was driven mainly by software licenses, especially its database and middleware solutions. However, over the past decade, we’ve seen a dramatic shift towards its robust cloud-based services. For context, in 2014, its cloud infrastructure-as-a-service and cloud software subscriptions accounted for 28.8% of sales. As per last year’s numbers, cloud licenses have soared to 82.2%, indicating a seismic shift in Oracle’s business model towards cloud dominance.\n\nOracle’s key partnerships and cloud integration efforts have proven critical in powering its growth strategy. Partnerships with giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft, Google, and xAI have enabled Oracle to integrate its cloud and data solutions across various platforms.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle’s cloud services support various applications, from AI to enterprise data management. Moreover, by interconnecting with other clouds, such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, Oracle’s infrastructure remains a cornerstone for multiple tech environments. Oracle’s link with the leading cloud providers cements its positioning as a mission-critical player as platforms evolve, enhancing performance and efficiency for AI and large database applications.\n\nFinal Word on Oracle Stock A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle has been on quite a run over the past nine months, leaving its competition in the dust. Despite its uninspiring start to the AI race, Oracle’s Q4 report has shown superb momentum in this area.\n\nWith a growing backlog and breakthrough AI deals, Oracle stock stands poised for even bigger gains. Moreover, its collaborations with AI giants in OpenAI and Google add to its competitiveness while solidifying its AI and cloud computing position. Moreover, with a strategic slant towards cloud dominance and key partnerships, Oracle remains positioned remarkably ahead.\n\nWall Street concurs, attracting a moderate buy rating from 26 analyst ratings. Price targets range from a low of $105 to a high of $175, with an average of $149.32, pointing north of 17% from its current price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Growth Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "Even though the market is in a downturn right now, I’m not ready to give up on A-rated growth stocks. You shouldn’t be, either.\n\nSome investors are in a tizzy right now because a temporary market correction is wiping out a lot of hard-earned gains from 2024. All three major indices are currently in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 5%, the Nasdaq Composite down nearly 9%, and the S&P 500 off more than 6%.\n\nBut don’t panic. Every bull market has an adjustment on occasion, but that’s why it pays off to think of investments over the long term. Because when you think of a five-year or 10-year window, the pain that we’ve all experienced in the last month or so will be just a blip in our long-term success stories.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvesting in A-rated growth stocks during a market downturn might seem counterintuitive, but you have to remember that these companies also have strong fundamentals – and they are positioned to quickly recover once the market restabilizes.\n\nIn fact, this is an ideal time to even add to your positions in your favorite stocks, because many are discounted from where they were just two or three months ago.\n\nI’m using the Portfolio Grader today to look for the best growth stocks on the market. These stocks, which earn their strong ratings based on analyst sentiment, growth history, earnings reports and momentum, are my top picks right now even in this rocky market.\n\nRemember – don’t panic when the markets temporarily turn red. Instead, look for the best stocks and consider them temporarily on sale.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has long been at the top of my list of best A-rated growth stocks and I’m not changing gears now. In fact, I’m betting that the semiconductor company’s stock will advance higher after the company reports its second quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on August 28.\n\nNvidia holds an enviable position as the maker of the most powerful and sought-after graphics processing units that are needed to run generative artificial intelligence programs. That helped the company grow from a market capitalization of $470 billion two years ago to topping the $3 trillion mark, temporarily, earlier this year.\n\nThe bear case for Nvidia is that big tech giants aren’t going to pay tens of thousands of dollars for GPUs forever – it’s more economical to make their own. But I see that as speculative doomsaying. On top of that, hedge fund Elliott Management is promoting the idea that the generative AI trend is a bubble that’s about to burst.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reality is that Nvidia stock is down 17% over the last month. It’s forward price-to-earnings ratio is down below 40x, which is appealing for a company that showed 262% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nNvidia stock is on sale, if you’re still a believer then this is price point is pretty appealing. NVDA stocks gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) The app for Coinbase (COIN) displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve always liked Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) as an ideal way to invest in cryptocurrencies without actually holding an altcoin. That’s because Coinbase operates what’s arguably the leading cryptocurrency training platform around.\n\nCoinbase’s platform offers investors the opportunity to buy and sell nearly 250 different cryptocurrencies. There’s something there for anyone who wants to delve into the market.\n\nAnd I’m also interested in a recent development – OpenAI executive Chris Lehane joined Coinbase’s board of directors. Any relationship, even informal, between Coinbase and the makers of ChatGPT is interesting to me.\n\nCoinbase already has its own generative AI platform, called CB-GPT, and is looking for ways to harness the technology into its business to improve efficiency and productivity.\n\nEarnings for the second quarter included revenue of $1.44 billion, up from $707 million a year ago. The company posted net income of $36.1 million and earnings per share of 15 cents versus a loss of $97.4 million and an EPS loss of 42 cents in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCoinbase is up 11% so far this year, but is currently on sale following a 13% drop in the last month. The stock gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD) image of General Dynamics (GD) website, representing dividend stocks\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is a defense contractor that works closely with the federal government on a variety of contracts.\n\nThe company makes everything from Gulfstream business jets to nuclear-powered submarines. It also makes guided missile destroyers, tanks and armored fighting vehicles.\n\nThe company had an outstanding second quarter, with revenue of $12 million that was up 18% from a year ago. Earnings of $1.2 billion showed better than 20% growth from the same quarter a year ago, and earnings per share was $3.26, an improvement of 20.7%.\n\nIf there’s anything to be concerned about, it’s that the book-to-bill ratio fell slightly, showing a ratio of 0.8-to-1. But General Dynamics still carries a backlog of $91.3 billion, so it’s not as if the company’s in danger.\n\nOn top of that, global conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and underlying tensions between the U.S. and China ensures that defense spending will continue to be a top priority for the U.S. government. And that’s good news for GD shareholders.\n\nGeneral Dynamics stock is up 10% so far this year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and an “A” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nUBS (UBS) UBS (UBS) logo with crossed keys\n\nI’m impressed with UBS (NYSE:UBS), the European bank that provides financial services in 50 countries.\n\nWhile it’s perhaps best known for global wealth management, UBS also provides personal banking, corporate banking and asset management.\n\nA year ago it announced purchased Credit Suisse Group for $3.4 billion in an all-stock deal that was made possible by Credit Suisse being badly damaged by a downturn in the U.S. banking sector in March 2023.\n\nWhile the merger was finalized last year, the banks continued to operate separately until this summer, when UBS finally deregistered Credit Suisse.\n\nWhen one bank takes over a troubled competitor, it’s usually a great deal for shareholders because the damaged bank typically can be bought for a discounted price. That’s what happened with UBS, as the company’s profits have soared since the merger.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter included revenue of $12.7 billion, up from $8.7 billion a year ago. Profits were $1.7 billion and 52 cents per share versus $1.02 billion and 32 cents per share a year ago.\n\nUBS stock is down 8% so far this year, but it still gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPiper Sandler (PIPR) A neutral colored piggy bank with gold coins flying in and out of it.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPiper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) is an investment bank based in Minneapolis. The company focuses on funding mergers and acquisitions, restructuring of companies, private placements and making deals in equity and debt capital markets.\n\nInvestment banks like Piper Sandler can be great picks for investors looking for growth stocks. They can generate great profits through underwriting, advisory services for mergers and acquisitions, trading, and asset management.\n\nWhen these banks perform well, their stocks can yield high returns for investors.\n\nPiper Sandler’s revenue for the second quarter was up significantly – reaching $339.1 million versus $288.7 million a year ago. Much of the growth was in the institutional banking segment, which grew from $183.9 million a year ago to $259.7 million in this quarter.\n\nThe growth helped Piper Sandler achieve net income of $34.7 million and $1.97 per share versus only $3.9 million and 23 cents per share a year ago.\n\nPIPR stock is up 5% so far this year and gets a “B” rating for growth and “A” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock Price\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen the economy is bad, one of the best places to invest are grocery stores that specialize in discounted merchandise.\n\nAfter all, people always have to eat and get consumer staples, and stores that help shoppers stretch their paycheck and battle inflation will always be in demand.\n\nThat’s why I like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). It operates 900 warehouse stores that offer everything from food to clothing and appliances. Net sales in July were $19.26 billion, up 7.1% from a year ago.\n\nI also appreciate that Costco is increasing by $5 annually for basic memberships and $10 annually for executive memberships. The company got $1.12 billion from membership fees in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, so that number should increase.\n\nCOST stock is up 24% this year, but notably has fallen 8% in the last month. That makes it an appealing buy right now, and is why COST stock gets a “B” rating for growth and an “A” rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCelestica (CLS) Person holding cellphone with website of Canadian electronics company Celestica Inc.

It provides manufacturing, hardware platform and supply chain expertise for its customers in the communications, aerospace, healthcare, industrial and capital equipment sectors.\n\nSupply chain issues were a well-known problem during the Covid-19 pandemic. When manufacturing shut down and shipping ground to a standstill, it was hard for many companies to get the materials they needed to operate.\n\nThose days are largely over, but people have a much greater appreciation today for the importance of companies that work to navigate supply chain issues.\n\nEarnings for the second quarter included $2.39 billion in revenue, up 23% from a year ago. Earnings per share came in at 91 cents, which was an improvement from 55 cents in EPS a year ago.\n\nCLS stock is up 60% this year, but it’s a bargain considering the stock dropped 18% in the last month. It gets “A” ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long position(s) in NVDA, GD, COST and CLS.  Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a long position in NVDA.

Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 124\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) impressed Wall Street with solid second-quarter results amid strong data center revenue. Data center revenue in the period grew 49% year over year.\n\nBut can Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) continue gaining in the coming months? Analysts are hopeful amid the launch of its Instinct™ MI300 Series accelerators that are designed for AI and HPC workloads.  The new chip competes with Nvidia’s H100 AI chip. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) now plans to release new AI chips annually, including the MI325X in Q4 this year, the MI350 in 2025, and the MI400 in 2026. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) said MI350 would be a competitor to Nvidia’s Blackwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) data center business doubled its revenue but this growth was not at the cost of profits. The segment’s operating income increased by 405% compared to the year-earlier period. However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  data center business is still very small compared with NVDA. It generated about $2.8 billion in revenue vs. $22.6 billion in quarterly revenue for NVDA.  However, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  CPU and GPU businesses are also thriving. Ryzen CPU sales increased 49% over year and slightly quarter over quarter. Although gaming revenue declined 59% due to decreased PlayStation and Xbox sales, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  Radeon 6000 GPUs saw a year-over-year sales increase.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD)  is trading 17% below its 3-year average P/E ratio. The company is estimated to grow its EPS by 43% in the long term, compared to 33% for Nvidia. During the third quarter, its revenue growth is expected to come in at 15% on a QoQ basis.  Amid growth forecasts based on new chips and an expected increase in AI spending by other companies, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) forward P/E of 38 makes the stock undervalued at the current levels.\n\nOverall, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has “no idea what I’m talking about” or it’s the market that just does not understand.\n\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the “driving seat” of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won’t be as easy as the market assumes.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Scooping Up Bargains in This $6.5 Trillion Market",
        "content": "Anything related to artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot ticket on Wall Street over the last 18 months. Shares of AI chip leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have more than doubled this year, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 index. But it's telling that the wealthiest investors are not chasing it at these lofty highs.\n\nBillionaires generally will not invest their assets in expensive growth stocks that could be susceptible to a market decline. Nvidia may continue to hit new highs this year, but there's also substantial downside risk if the company doesn't meet Wall Street's sky-high growth expectations.\n\nBillionaires are interested in growing and preserving their assets. This usually leads them to look for reasonably priced companies that have competitive advantages that are underestimated by the market.\n\nOne area these investors are plowing into right now is China's $6.5 trillion retail sector, which has been under pressure due to a weak economy, driving down the valuations for leading companies. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management were busy buying shares of China's leading retail stocks in the first quarter.\n\nIn fact, Tepper's firm has been selling Nvidia and piling into Chinese retail stocks. Let's look at two stocks and one ETF these investors have been buying this year.\n\n1. Alibaba\n\nShares of Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) are down 75% over the last four years, as intensifying competition in China's e-commerce market, most notably from PDD Holdings' Temu, and a choppy economy pressured sales at Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao marketplaces.\n\nAlibaba was David Tepper's largest holding as of March 31 after his firm more than doubled its stake in the quarter. Tepper is one of the most successful hedge fund managers of the last 20 years. His net worth nearly doubled over the last five years to more than $20 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nAlibaba operates one of the largest retailer marketplaces in China, but it doesn't sell goods from its own inventory. Instead, it generates a profitable stream of revenue from fees and commissions it charges to merchants that sell through its marketplaces, including AliExpress. It also has several revenue streams from cloud services, logistics services, and digital entertainment. However, online commerce is Alibaba's largest business.\n\nOver the last year, the company generated $21 billion in free cash flow on $130 billion of revenue. The stock trades at an incredibly low price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 8. At this bargain-basement valuation, the stock offers significant upside if the company can sustain any amount of growth in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the March-ending fiscal fourth quarter, Alibaba's total revenue grew 8% year over year, driven by a 45% year-over-year increase in its international commerce business. AliExpress continues to experience great momentum in overseas markets, but management also noted that its Tmall Taobao group saw higher purchase frequency after making efforts to be more price competitive.\n\nAlibaba is starting to regain strength in China's e-commerce market, which explains why Tepper likes the stock's return prospects at these lower share prices.\n\n2. JD.com\n\nShares of JD.com(NASDAQ: JD) are also down 75% off their previous peak. JD was a fast-growing business just a few years ago, with annual revenue growing more than 20% year over year through 2021. But the challenging retail market caused revenue to decline by less than 1% in 2023.\n\nHoward Marks' background involves investing in high-yield bonds and distressed debt, so he's an expert at evaluating risks. This is notable, as his firm added to its stake in JD.com in the first quarter. Oaktree also holds positions in several other China stocks, including Alibaba, so he clearly sees attractive value across China's internet sector.\n\nUnlike Alibaba, JD.com holds inventory that it sells itself, so it doesn't have the high margins of its peer. However, the company's competitive advantage is found in its supply chain capabilities. For example, Walmart sells on JD.com's platform, which indicates a tremendously valuable asset the company brings to China's massive retail sector.\n\nJD.com also has growing capabilities in AI that it uses to manage inventory and merchandise sourcing. The company also uses this technology to gather consumer insights that help grow sales and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter a year of weak sales, JD is leveraging these strengths to its advantage. After getting more price competitive, it noted higher shopping frequency and increased order volume in the first quarter. Total revenue grew 7% year over year -- a significant improvement.\n\nMost encouraging is that the greater price competitiveness didn't hurt margins. It still posted a 15% increase in net income over the year-ago quarter. Yet, the stock still trades at an incredibly low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.3. It's even cheaper on a price-to-free cash flow basis.\n\n3. KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF\n\nDavid Tepper also has been buying the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF(NYSEMKT: KWEB), which is a great option for investors to gain instant diversification and potential upside from China's leading online retail and entertainment companies.\n\nHere's a list of the top 10 holdings in the fund as of Aug. 1, and their percentage weighting:\n\nTencent Holdings (10.64%) Alibaba (10.29%) PDD Holdings (7.96%) Meituan (7.45%) JD.com (5.68%) Netease (4.43%) Tencent Music Entertainment (4.07%) Baidu (4.02%) KE Holdings (3.81%) Kuaishou Technology (3.79%)\n\nFrom the fund's inception in 2013 through 2020, a $1,000 investment would have grown to $3,100. But an investor who held from inception through the collapse over the last few years would still be sitting on a small gain.\n\nChina's economy can be significantly impacted by new laws and regulations, which is why investors probably shouldn't consider this ETF for a long-term buy-and-hold. But the outlook for significant returns over the next few years looks very favorable if leading retail companies continue to show improving sales trends.\n\nThe fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%, which is reasonable for a specialty fund that is tracking a specific sector of the market. This means it costs $7 annually to hold shares for every $1,000 invested.\n\nOverall, this ETF's diversification makes it the safest way to profit from China's retail comeback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Hypergrowth Company Will Be Wall Street's First $6 Trillion Stock -- and It's Not Nvidia!",
        "content": "Change is one of the only constants investors will find on Wall Street. Thanks to a combination of innovation, acquisitions, mergers, bankruptcies, legal judgments, competition, and even Acts of God, the stock market's \"leaderboard\" is constantly in flux. This is to say that Wall Street's largest companies today aren't liable to hold their positions five, 10, or even 20 years from now.\n\nJust six years ago, tech goliath Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made history by becoming the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market cap. By June 2023, it had crossed the psychological $3 trillion barrier. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt took less than five years for the stock market's largest company to triple in value, which begs the question: Which hypergrowth company will be the first to double the current peak of a little over $3 trillion in market cap and reach a $6 trillion valuation?\n\nWhile I'll give you my very clear prediction in a moment, let me work my way backwards and show why some of today's most-influential businesses within the \"Magnificent Seven\" aren't the answer.\n\nNvidia and Apple? No chance.\n\nConsidering that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest thing since sliced bread, you'd think AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would have the inside track to becoming Wall Street's most-valuable business. However, I've been pointing out for months just how many headwinds the ace of the AI movement is set to face.\n\nDespite having superior AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) with top-notch compute ability, Nvidia's inability to satisfy all of its customers will open the door for external competitors to grab market share.\n\nLikewise, all four of Nvidia's largest customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, they're going to take up valuable data center space and lessen the need for Nvidia's hardware in the years to come.\n\nThe biggest worry might just be that every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years has navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. With most businesses lacking a clear gameplan with their AI investments, it looks probable that the AI bubble will burst sooner than later, and ultimately drag Nvidia down with it.\n\nAs for Apple, its growth engine has mostly stalled out. Net sales are up by about 1% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). Although a record-breaking buyback program has been a major help to Apple's bottom line, it makes no sense for investors to pay a high multiple to earnings if Apple's sales growth is hardly above the flatline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile subscription services continue to be a bright spot -- up 13.2% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023 -- lagging iPhone sales are liable to drag on Apple's share price.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms? Possibly, but ample headwinds exist.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) do have a path to a $6 trillion valuation, but would need things to go just right for it to happen.\n\nMicrosoft enjoys sustainable moats and exorbitant cash flow from its legacy Windows and Office segments, and should deliver double-digit sales growth from Azure, the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. With plenty of cash on hand, Microsoft can easily invest for the future via organic or inorganic means.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is also heavily tied to the AI revolution via its investments in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT. If the AI bubble were to burst, as I expect it will, it could be hit harder than other \"Magnificent Seven\" members, aside from Nvidia.\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet should benefit nicely from the growth of its cloud infrastructure service platform known as Google Cloud. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early innings, which bodes well for this high-margin operating segment.\n\nThe only true knock I have against Alphabet is its strongly cyclical ties. With roughly 76% of its $84.7 billion in second-quarter sales derived from advertising, Alphabet will always be somewhat tethered to the health of the U.S. and global economy, as well as investor sentiment.\n\nComparatively, Meta Platforms is even more reliant on advertising. Just shy of 98% of its $75.5 billion in net sales through the first-half of 2024 have come from ads on its social media platforms.\n\nAlthough long-winded economic expansions are a positive for Meta's ad-driven operating model, and the company's metaverse investments have a chance to pay off in a big way in the latter-half of this decade, its stock would have to quintuple in value to become Wall Street's first $6 trillion company. This seems a stretch given the potential for U.S. economic growth to slow in the coming quarters. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $6 trillion stock is likely to be...\n\nThough it's going to take some time -- i.e., don't expect the stock market's outsized annual returns to continue indefinitely -- my prediction is that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will cut the proverbial ribbon and cross the $6 trillion threshold before any other publicly traded company.\n\nWhile most people have acquainted themselves with Amazon through its globally leading online marketplace, the nuts-and-bolts that generate the bulk of the company's operating cash flow have little to do with e-commerce.\n\nFirst and foremost, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. AWS held a 31% share of cloud infrastructure services spending as of the end of 2023, with annual run-rate sales topping $105 billion, as of June 30. This segment is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, and it should play a key role in doubling Amazon's operating cash flow by 2026.\n\nAmazon is also just beginning to harness the value of its content via its Prime subscription service. Landing an 11-year streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), coupled with being the exclusive partner of Thursday Night Football, makes Amazon's video platform the wave of the future. It should have no trouble increasing Prime subscription prices, as well as generating boatloads of advertising revenue.\n\nSpeaking of advertising services, Amazon is seeing north of 3 billion visits to its website on a monthly basis. Since many visitors to Amazon are motivated shoppers, businesses are willing to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered year-over-year constant-currency sales growth of at least 20% dating back more than two years.\n\nEven if the AI bubble bursts and takes Nvidia and Microsoft down with it, Amazon's various fast-growing ancillary channels can sustain double-digit growth.\n\nWhat's more, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock during the 2010s. Investors in Amazon today are only paying 11.5 times forecast cash flow for 2025. If Amazon were to be valued at the same median cash-flow multiple it carried throughout the 2010s, and it continues to grow at its existing pace, it would have the clearest path to a $6 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These 2 Superb Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best-performing stocks over the past couple of years, literally adding trillions of dollars in value to its shareholder's portfolios. Several big hedge fund managers were among those investors who made a lot of money by investing early in Nvidia. But now they're starting to take their chips off the table and place bets in a couple of other incredible artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nSome hedge fund managers selling investments in Nvidia include:\n\nStanley Druckenmiller: sold 71% (441,551) of his family office's shares and 100% (4,895) of his call options on Nvidia. Israel Englander: sold 35% (720,004) of Millennium Management's shares and 31% (6,910) of its call options. He maintains a heavy position in Nvidia put options, which give him the right to sell the stock at a certain price. Chris Rokos: sold 41% (105,453) of his hedge fund's shares. Philippe Laffont: sold 68% (2,937,060) of Coatue Management's shares.\n\nThere are many more examples of big sales from institutional investors. After the meteoric rise of Nvidia's share price, it makes sense for them to at least reduce their stake. However, average investors should be more interested in what big hedge fund managers are buying now.\n\nHere are two superb AI stocks billionaires are buying as they sell Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) vaulted to the forefront of the AI space when it added $10 billion to its investment in generative AI leader OpenAI in early 2023. Despite its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world before the AI boom, artificial intelligence is proving to be a substantial growth area for the technology company.\n\nSeveral billionaire fund managers saw an opportunity to buy more shares of Microsoft in the first quarter, including:\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen: bought 1,596,887 shares, reestablishing a position in the stock for his Viking Global Investors fund. Steven Cohen: bought 566,749 shares, more than doubling Point72's stake in the stock. He also disposed of options positions, including 1,844 put options. Chris Rokos: bought 274,232 shares, increasing his hedge fund's stake by 172% from the fourth quarter.\n\nMicrosoft's core AI product is Azure AI, which provides cloud solutions for AI developers looking to use existing foundation models to deploy new AI-powered software solutions. The company grew its Azure AI customers by 60% year over year last quarter, and the average expenditure per customer is growing, too.\n\nMicrosoft is investing heavily in building out its data center capacity. But management said it will take some time for all of it to come online. As a result, it expects an acceleration in Azure revenue in the second half of fiscal 2025. That's quite a feat, considering it's already the fastest-growing hyperscale cloud provider today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also offers its own AI assistants across its enterprise software portfolio, which is called Copilot. Adoption is growing quickly, with customers increasing 60% quarter over quarter. With over 400 million Office 365 commercial seats, there's a long runway for growth for the product.\n\nThe stock currently trades around 30 times forward earnings estimates. While that's a significant premium to the S&P 500, the stock seems well worth the price. It's leadership in enterprise software solutions and AI development should provide years of outsized growth.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has long been at the forefront of AI development. Machine learning algorithms form the backbone of the content feeds on Facebook and Instagram, along with the up-and-coming Threads, which recently passed 200 million monthly active users.\n\nRecently, it's turned its attention to generative AI, developing and open-sourcing the Llama family of foundation models, which are behind its Meta AI feature in Instagram and Facebook as well as many other behind-the-scenes features. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the ambition to turn Meta into \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\nBillionaires are buying into Zuckerberg's vision and putting their money into the stock. Some high-profile purchases in the first quarter include:\n\nChris Rokos: bought 377,551 shares, reestablishing a position for his hedge fund for the first time since 2022. Ray Dalio: added 327,992 shares of the stock, increasing Bridgewater Associates' stake by 49%. Stanley Druckenmiller: bought 63,930 shares, reestablishing a position.\n\nWhile Meta already uses AI across its family of apps for content recommendations, it's starting to integrate it into its advertising services. Zuckerberg said he sees a day when \"advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business's objective and a budget, and we're going to do the rest for them,\" during Meta's second-quarter earnings call. He also sees Meta facilitating the creation of AI service agents for business, which opens the door for more business messaging monetization opportunities.\n\nPut it all together, and AI will have a considerable impact on Meta's continued revenue growth. Increased engagement combined with lower hurdles to creating and targeting advertisements and improving the algorithms needed to target those advertisements as accurately as possible should all result in strong revenue and profit growth for the social media company. Meanwhile, its hardware business, including its Oculus VR headsets and Ray-Ban sunglasses, is showing strong growth bolstered by its AI features.\n\nMeta shares currently trade around 23 times forward earnings estimates, which is considerably lower than most AI stocks. That's despite the fact that Meta's bottom line continues to grow at a steady rate in the mid to high double digits, giving it a very attractive PEG ratio. Its continued investments in AI should ultimately produce strong returns for the company and its shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 8, 2024 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality.\"\n\nA Closer Look at the Current Earnings Picture\n\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week’sEarnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods. For the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index’s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates. For 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July. Q2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the ‘Mag 7’, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA – have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies’ Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\n\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market’s issue with the Mag 7 companies’ quarterly reports wasn’t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe don’t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector’s positive earnings outlook is the sector’s margins outlook.\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year’s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector’s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\n\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "content": "Investing.com-- PC maker HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) is planning to shift more than half of its computer production away from China amid concerns over geopolitical risks with Taiwan, Nikkei Asia reported.\n\nHP has set an internal goal of making up to 70% of its notebooks outside China, and is looking at Singapore and Thailand as potential production destinations, the Nikkei report said.\n\nThe firm is setting up a backup design hub in Singapore, while at least five HP suppliers are building production facilities and storage areas in Thailand, the Nikkei report said.\n\nHP has a major production presence in China and Taiwan, but now appears to be joining a slew of its technology peers in diversifying its supply chain away from the region.\n\nPeers such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) were seen shifting production away from China and into Southeast Asia over the past two years, amid disruptions from China’s strict zero-COVID policies and as trade tensions with the U.S. grew.\n\nU.S. trade restrictions against China are set to become a bigger point of contention for tech manufacturers in the country, especially after Washington banned the export of advanced artificial intelligence technology to China.\n\nThis has led to manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) developing chips specifically geared towards the Chinese market- a move that is also expected to increase costs.\n\nTensions with Taiwan have also increased in recent years, as China kept up its rhetoric of reuniting the island with the mainland. But Taiwan has largely rejected such calls, and is a major recipient of U.S. defense aid.\n\nHP is the world's second-biggest maker of personal computers, behind only Lenovo, as of end-2023.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHP plans aggressive shift away from China amid geopolitical risks- Nikkei Asia\n\nChina's drivers fret as robotaxis pick up pace - and passengers\n\nUS judge tosses much of Mexico's lawsuit against US gun makers\n\nView comments",

        "title": "US stock futures drift lower as rebound stalls, tech weakness persists",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Wednesday after a Wall Street rebound ran out of steam, while weakness in technology stocks persisted as major chipmakers were pressured by middling earnings.\n\nLosses in futures followed a volatile session on Wall Street, where stock benchmarks ended lower despite a strong start to the day. U.S. stock indexes were nursing steep losses over the past week amid heightened concerns over a recession.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.4% to 5,208.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.5% to 17,873.0 points by 19:16 ET (23:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 38,822.0 points.\n\nTech sees extended losses after Super Micro tumble\n\nMajor technology stocks saw extended losses in aftermarket trade, with Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) in the lead after it clocked underwhelming earnings for the June quarter. Super Micro fell 2% after plummeting 20% during the session.\n\nThe firm’s underwhelming earnings added to doubts over just how much demand the artificial intelligence will fuel, and sparked extended losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 1.2%, while Super Micro peer Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) slid over 6%.\n\nLosses in chipmakers also soured already weak sentiment towards broader tech stocks, with majors such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) losing between 0.7% and 1.2% in aftermarket trade.\n\nA rout in technology stocks was a key driver of Wall Street’s losses in recent weeks, as middling earnings from the biggest stocks in the sector sparked heavy profit-taking. Expectations of interest rate cuts also saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive stocks, although this trade was also stymied by fears of a U.S. recession.\n\nWall Street nurses losses as rebound stalls\n\nWall Street indexes closed lower on Wednesday as a rebound from two and three-month lows largely stalled.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 5,199.50 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1% to 16,198.86 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 38,763.45 points.\n\nAll three indexes were nursing steep losses over the past few weeks, with the Nasdaq having entered correction territory on Monday.\n\nLosses were sparked by increasing fears of a recession, following a slew of weak readings on the labor market and business activity. A slew of disappointing earnings also battered sentiment.\n\nWeak earnings continued to trickle in. Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) slid 11% in aftermarket trade on disappointing second-quarter earnings, while Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) fell nearly 2%, extending losses from the session after it also logged weak earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBumble Inc (NASDAQ:BMBL) plummeted 30% after it cut its annual revenue forecast.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures drift lower as rebound stalls, tech weakness persists\n\nChina's drivers fret as robotaxis pick up pace - and passengers\n\nUS judge tosses much of Mexico's lawsuit against US gun makers\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\n\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index’s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\n\nQ2 earnings for the ‘Magnificent 7’ companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the ‘Mag 7’, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\n\nThe ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA – have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies’ Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\n\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market’s issue with the Mag 7 companies’ quarterly reports wasn’t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\n\nWe don’t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\n\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\n\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. The chart below shows how the aggregate earnings total for the Tech sector has evolved over the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows how estimates for the Mag 7 group have evolved lately. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector’s positive earnings outlook is the sector’s margins outlook, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year’s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector’s productivity.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that this year’s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year’s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\n\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "As I expected, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) rocket-ship rally is beginning to stall, with shares down by roughly 21% over the last 30 days. And while Nvidia is still a great company, the combination of a high valuation and low diversification leaves room for continued downside. Let's explore how recession fears and artificial intelligence (AI) fatigue could play out over the next three years.\n\nEconomic storm clouds gather\n\nIt is impossible to predict a recession for sure, but data is pointing toward a possible slowdown in economic activity. In July, the U.S. only added 114,000 jobs compared to expectations of 175,000, while the unemployment rate hit 4.3% -- its highest level since 2021. And while the Federal Reserve is expected to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, it might be too little too late to avoid a so-called hard landing. Rate cuts can be a helpful tool, but they can't magically fix every problem in a shaky economy.\n\nFor Nvidia, a recession could be a disaster. While the company has dominated the AI industry by producing cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run and train these complex conversational algorithms, it can't prevent its business model from being undermined by macroeconomic factors outside its control.\n\nNvidia sells luxury products\n\nNvidia's business has historically been cyclical. When money is tight, consumers are less likely to spring for expensive computer upgrades, instead opting for cheaper used options -- or foregoing them altogether. While a shift to enterprise-level hardware shields Nvidia from the whims of PC gamers, similar dynamics could also arise in the market for AI chips.\n\nAnalysts are beginning to sound the alarm about the billions being spent on AI hardware with limited results on the bottom line. Goldman Sachs analyst Jim Covello puts the situation in stark terms, stating: \"Despite its expensive price tag, the technology is nowhere near where it needs to be in order to be useful. Overbuilding things the world doesn't have use for, or is not ready for, typically ends badly.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile tech companies are content to speculate on unprofitable AI investments when the economy is good, the current level of spending may not hold up when conditions weaken. During recessions, businesses usually downsize their non-essential and non-profitable segments first, and right now, AI seems to fit solidly into that troubled category.\n\nNvidia may be underdiversified\n\nNvidia's first-quarter revenue jumped 262% to $26 billion, driven by data-center chip sales, which rose by an eyewatering 427% to $22.6 billion. But while this growth is impressive, it puts most of Nvidia's financial eggs in one basket. Data-center sales now represent 87% of total revenue driven by a few flagship products, such as the A100 and H200, which power typical large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.\n\nOther segments, like gaming (10% of revenue) or professional visualization (2% of revenue), have faded into irrelevance in the current market, making Nvidia vulnerable to any potential slowdown in demand for AI accelerator chips.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nAfter rising by over 450% over the last three years, Nvidia stock has historically been a spectacular investment. And there is still a lot to love about the company because of its industry leadership in the global-chip industry. That said, shares seem to have peaked for now.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 42, Nvidia's valuation prices in future growth that may not materialize, especially if the U.S. economy begins to slow and enterprise clients start to rethink their massive AI chip purchases. Nvidia looks overexposed to this fragile industry and may experience a major correction in the coming years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you “cry yourself to sleep.” Cramer said that this “nasty” selloff was expected.\n\n“It’s exactly what you’d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was “vicious enough” to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that’s exactly “what you have to do.” He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their “pants down” when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it’s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet “until we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.”\n\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn’t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he’d do it.\n\n“He’s got horse sense,” Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said there are no “safe havens” in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for “pain” in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\n“If you can’t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer is Talking About NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Amid Global Selloff?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program reiterated that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is doing “amazing things” with generative AI and accelerated computing and they don’t have anything to do with the Fed. Despite this, Cramer said that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has “become a wasteland.”\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer said he does not see NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) decline stopping here mainly because the company does not benefit from the upcoming rate cuts.\n\nCramer thinks the market’s earnings estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is low, and “maybe” the company can earn $4.59 next year, which means it’s trading at 23x earnings.\n\n“I am not selling the greatest growth stock of our generation” at 23 times earnings, Cramer said.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are on the decline amid valuation concerns. However, Morgan Stanley re-added the stock to its top picks list. Analyst Joseph Moore said:\n\n“Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer,” the firm said.\n\nHowever, the latest big tech earnings have raised some concerns on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) future growth trajectory. The company’s major customers including Meta Platforms and Alphabet have indicated that they may be overbuilding and overspending on AI chips. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is selling about 2 million of its GPUs on an annual basis based on 2023 data. As demand moderates and competitors up their production, the company won’t be able to sustain its current growth trajectory.\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock’s price target at $135.\n\n“We downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.” New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Dump as Investors Rotate to Dow Jones Components",
        "content": "Monday’s sudden market crash disrupted investor sentiment. However, growing recession fears have investors pondering which stocks to sell in anticipation of a potential rotation into the Dow Jones.\n\nIn July, investors were concerned that tech stocks had peaked after riding high on artificial intelligence (AI) developments. Some stocks were sold into more stable options concentrated in the Dow Jones or, in some cases, holding cash. For example, Warren Buffett reduced Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings by half last quarter, realizing gains and accumulating over a quarter trillion for the next market move.\n\nInvestors seeking to emulate the Oracle of Omaha have few names to choose from, as first-half gains came mostly from tech stocks. These could now lose favor as small-cap and value stocks are seen as stronger in an uncertain environment with interest rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns. Whether the “great rotation” means buying safer Dow components or the overall market declines, some tech stocks might be sold for the Dow rotation as valuations may unnerve traders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that could see price declines as traders rotate to Dow Jones components and other safer areas in this top-heavy, overvalued market.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world’s largest crypto exchanges could be particularly vulnerable if the market turmoil doesn’t calm down. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) reported a relatively solid Q2 earnings report, riding the surge of interest in cryptocurrencies. However, as the flash crash shows, crypto is particularly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. The company could quickly reverse its fortunes if the U.S. economic situation deteriorates.\n\nCOIN stock is up 35% this year thanks to investors hoping the economy will thread a relatively narrow gap. This gap is between growing too fast so that the Fed will cut rates and slowing down so that investors stay away from high-risk assets like crypto. As such, Coinbase trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7 times. This is actually quite good for a tech stock. However, that’s not where the problem lies.\n\nThe company held crypto assets worth $1.2 billion at the end of last quarter. Even with the price of BTC (BTC-USD) remaining relatively stable from April to June, it recorded a $319 million impact on its profit. A substantial drop in the price of crypto could severely impact the company’s bottom line and drag the stock price significantly lower. Therefore, investors should consider Coinbase as one of the stocks to sell for Dow rotation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe PC chipmaker has been riding Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) coattails as investors expect other companies to develop rival AI chips. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has invested heavily in AI. The company does have AI-oriented chips for PCs. However, it still hasn’t made any headway in taking market share from Nvidia’s enterprise-level AI chips that concentrate most of the sector’s investment.\n\nInvestors have pushed the company’s P/E ratio into the triple digits. Yet, its EPS hasn’t kept up. Although the AMD stock price has been drifting lower through the second quarter, it could still have further to go before its valuation stabilizes. Investors may want to consider AMD as one of the stocks to sell for Dow rotation.\n\nAMD currently trades at a P/E ratio of 160 times, which is four times higher than the tech sector average. Analysts have been cutting their outlook for the company over the last three months. They expect the net quarter’s EPS to come in at $0.92, down from the $0.95 expected previously.\n\nDataDog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cloud hosting company is another firm riding the AI wave that has pushed its valuation to really high overexpectations. It appears that in the future, DataDog (NASDAQ:DDOG) will see strong demand thanks to all the data hosting and processing power that AI will need.\n\nDespite the company’s most recent reported sales growing at a 27% clip, it only just returned to profitability. Any hiccup in AI development could lower its earnings. For instance, major corporations could slow down spending on AI items due to transient economic uncertainty.\n\nDataDog’s main problem in an environment where fear is overtaking greed is that its P/E ratio stands at 308.7 times. This makes DDOG stock a highly speculative investment. Also, its market cap exceeds its enterprise value and the company still pays no dividends.\n\nWhile it might have good potential in the future, investors may want to consider keeping it on the sell list of stocks to sell for Dow rotation. After all, the current market uncertainty has not been resolved yet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "AI stocks have gone out of style in recent weeks, and while some of the names may have been overvalued, it’s unlikely that an AI bubble is bursting before our eyes.\n\nNot to discount the magnitude of pain that the latest tech plunge has inflicted on investor portfolios, but the S&P 500 hasn’t even officially entered correction territory (that’s a 10% fall from the top) quite yet. Though the Nasdaq 100 is down around 13%, only three and a half months’ worth of gains have been wiped out so far.\n\nFurther, recession fears seem unfounded after just one poor jobs report. Though the correction and potential growth scare could entail more pain to come for tech, I’d argue that innovation in AI will keep on pushing forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s really no stopping the AI train in its tracks once it’s left the station. Recession or not, AI will just keep getting better, more useful, and, perhaps most importantly, more monetizable from here. Here are three AI-focused stocks that may be worth pursuing amid the tech sell-off.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) technology company. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the AI darling that’s seen its shares rapidly retreat of late. With NVDA stock now down around 23% from its all-time high, the many who missed the boat on the name may have another shot to buy in at a fairly reasonable multiple.\n\nSurprisingly, NVDA stock hasn’t been hit nearly as hard as some of the other semiconductor firms — think Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after that brutal quarter — out there. With the company continuing to do more than its share of the heavy lifting for the AI boom, there seem to be a handful of reasons to hang on despite recent turbulence.\n\nThough NVDA stock could go either way over the near term, a few analysts are already pounding the table on Nvidia after the latest dip. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer, who’s upbeat on the stock, recently noted that he doesn’t see the company losing market share from recent “minor” production delays.\n\nNvidia mostly seems to be falling for reasons outside its control. As the market lets earnings do the talking (and walking) once again, a rebound for NVDA stock may not be too far off.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew companies are in a position to truly shape the future of technology, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It has changed the world by “thinking differently” many times in the past. Whether we’re talking about the rise of the Mac, iPod or iPhone, it’s clear Apple knows how to polish and fine-tune emerging technologies for mass audiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp ahead, the next big thing for Apple seems to be AI. Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT could be a match that changes how we interact with our smartphones. Indeed, the possibilities of an Apple Intelligence iPhone are endless. Still, there’s no guarantee that Apple Intelligence will be the big growth booster many are expecting.\n\nThe latest Apple Intelligence preview has finally arrived. Still, nothing about the first beta seems truly ground-breaking just yet. Maybe the full release will change that.\n\nIn any case, Apple’s AI needs to be as capable as its rivals’, but it also needs to be better, much better, if it wants to grab the AI bull by the horns.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor firm that could single-handedly push PCs into the age of Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) processors. Indeed, Apple’s move into Arm chips has been a successful one. And though Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X Elite chips are incredibly powerful and power efficient, the PCs incorporating them have had a handful of compatibility issues.\n\nSnapdragon-powered PCs may have arrived, but many programs aren’t ready for the Arm age. It will take some time for developers to get up to speed with the latest Snapdragon-powered PCs. In any case, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip seems like a strong top candidate as PCs look to become better equipped to run AI without having to connect to the cloud.\n\nAfter shedding 30% of its value since its June peak, perhaps now’s as good a time as any to nibble on the name while it’s going for a mere 14.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). The 2.14% dividend yield is also notable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday, erasing gains from early in the session as chip stocks led the way lower during a trading session that saw all three major indexes close in red figures.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia and other chip names came despite a bullish note from Piper Sandler analysts published Wednesday, which pointed investors to a \"tremendous opportunity\" to buy some chip names following sector's recent sell-off.\n\n\"Fundamentally, NVDA remains the strongest player in the AI accelerator space,\" wrote Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar, highlighting the company's next-generation chip. \"We also believe that strong tailwinds from the Blackwell architecture coming in October will continue to drive revenues well into 2025 as demand exceeds supply.\"\n\n\"As such,\" the firm added, \"we see tremendous opportunity in NVDA stock with the price off meaningfully from highs of $140.\" Piper has an Overweight rating and $140 price target on the stock.\n\nDuring Monday's market meltdown, The Information reported Nvidia's upcoming next-generation AI chips would be delayed by three months, potentially impacting its biggest customers like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.\n\nSubsequently, Nvidia issued a statement stating its next-generation Blackwell chip \"production is on track to ramp\" in the second half of the year.\n\nAlong with Nvidia, Kumar said Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) remains a \"Top Pick\" for the firm as it gains share in the traditional server market amid struggles with incumbents like Intel. Intel (INTC) stock last Friday fell more than 28% following a poor quarterly report.\n\nPiper Sandler's team also sees an opportunity for AMD should Nvidia's chips turn out to be delayed.\n\n\"We believe there is not a lot of truth to the NVDA chip delay, but if it is true, near-term this would bode well for AMD if NVDA is struggling with supply and/or timing of chips,\" wrote Kumar. AMD stock fell 1% on Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Nvidia jumped more than 12% following peer AMD's quarterly results showing Big Tech continues to spend on data center infrastructure, a promising sign for chip suppliers.\n\nChip stocks have been volatile over the past few weeks as Big Tech names have led the market downturn.\n\nSince the start of July, the Philly Semiconductor Index is down almost 15%, a move that Piper said prompted it to revisit its coverage and look for \"ideas that we believe remain well-positioned fundamentally.\"\n\nAlong with Nvidia and AMD, the firm sees ON Semiconductor (ON) as well positioned in this environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarly Wednesday, chip stocks attempted a rebound that was punctuated by the recent market meltdown that sent the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) into correction territory.\n\nNvidia stock fell more than 6% on Monday as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks saw market cap losses of more than $650 billion during Monday's market plunge.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investors are getting tired of waiting for Big Tech companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) to deliver on their AI revenue promises. That’s the main takeaway from this past earnings season as companies continue to plow money into their ambitious AI offerings without offering much insight into when it will all pay off.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet spent $13 billion in capital expenditures in its most recent quarter building out its AI infrastructure, up from $12 billion in the same period last year. Microsoft spent $19 billion, an increase from the $10.7 billion the company spent last year.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, announced during its earnings report that it spent $30 billion in the first half of the year on spending related to its Amazon Web Services platform.\n\nDespite such massive spending levels, companies have been relatively mum on AI revenue, instead choosing to either offer a percentage of growth attributable to AI or simply pointing to their overall cloud services numbers.\n\nThe problem is that the generative AI craze just isn’t living up to the hype. At least not yet.\n\n“[Generative AI] is not yielding benefits that are in tune with … the hype in the market, or in tune even with what customers were expecting out of this,” explained Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran. Google DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis (L) and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai open the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference focusing on how artificial intelligence is being woven into search, email, virtual meetings and more in Mountain View, Calif., on May 14, 2024. (GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\n“That's kind of the narrative that we see when we talk to enterprise CIOs today.”\n\nThose benefits will come as generative AI technologies continue to mature, but, experts say, it won’t happen overnight.\n\nToo fast with too little benefit\n\nThere are two issues at play for generative AI. The first is that tech companies are rolling out new AI models and platforms too quickly for their customers to keep up, and the other is that the technology is still relatively new.\n\n“What is happening today is we see fast-paced and kind of furious innovation, and the CIOs are saying, ‘Hey, this is just coming too fast at us. We want you to slow down a little bit, and we want you to make sure that the products that you're building, or the models that you're building, actually work very well before you go and build that next model', ” explained Chandrasekaran.\n\nIt’s not just the speed at which companies are pumping out models, but also whether their customers can understand and trust them.\n\n“It's going to take a while to mature and understand how organizations are going to utilize it effectively,” explained Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, companies won't begin signing up for enormous, long-term AI software plans until they're confident that the platforms are the right fit for them and that their employees will actually benefit from them.\n\nThat’s not the kind of news that investors, who have seen the meteoric rise of Nvidia (NVDA), want to hear. They want 100%+ stock price gains and massive jumps in revenue.\n\nBut Nvidia offers a fundamentally different product than Microsoft or Amazon or Google. Nvidia is laying out the hardware to power AI systems. So for any of the Big Tech firms to even get into the AI business, they need Nvidia’s chips. Because of that, Nvidia is making money by the boatload on AI now.\n\nFor the company’s fiscal Q1 2025, Nvidia reported $26 billion in revenue. That's just shy of the $27 billion in revenue Nvidia brought in in all of 2023. To say Nvidia is raking in money is an understatement. And it’s all thanks to its AI chip sales.\n\nMajor cloud providers, meanwhile, need more time to develop their AI software and figure out how their customers will eventually use it. And even then, they’ll inevitably need to add or remove features depending on user feedback. That process is likely to take years, and it’s also why software makers aren’t seeing the kinds of massive returns on their investments Nvidia has.\n\n“When we really think about the growth of the AI market, I don't think anyone's wrong with how high they think the market can go,” said Forrester principal analyst Christopher Gilchrist. “I just don't think that the timeframe in which shareholder expectations or market expectations are putting it, I don't think that's realistic at all.”\n\nIn its most recent quarterly earnings report, Microsoft said its AI efforts contributed 8 points of growth to its Azure business. But since Microsoft doesn’t tell us exactly how much its Azure segment makes, it’s not exactly a helpful number. Google and Amazon are equally opaque on their AI-powered revenue.\n\nHow long does the timeframe look for a true return on investment then? According to Gilchrist, companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and other AI software providers could begin to make meaningful cash on their AI sales within the next three years. In some cases, however, it could take as long as five to seven years.\n\nSo, strap in. Because it’s going to take a while for generative AI software to live up to the hype.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders whipsawed by the stock market’s gyrations are bracing for more bouts of volatility in the coming sessions, starting with Thursday’s report on US jobless claims.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants Paris Spent €1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\n\nThe options market is implying the S&P 500 Index will move 1.2% in either direction that day, based on the cost of at-the-money puts and calls, said Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup Inc.’s head of US equity trading strategy. Should that pricing remain in place by Wednesday’s close, it would be in line with the implied move for Aug. 14 — the next reading on consumer prices — and Aug. 29, the day after Nvidia Corp.’s earnings report.\n\n“We remain surprised by the fast embrace of recession risks with the Atlanta Fed GDP tracking 2.9% and claims this Thursday will be very important,” Kaiser wrote in a note to clients. He said the potential for big swings “also reflects the elevated level of short-dated implied volatility, so likely isn’t pricing explicit event risk as much as macro risk dynamics.”\n\nTraders are looking to the weekly jobless claims figures, due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington on Thursday, for clues as to whether the labor market is weakening further after Friday’s jobs report showed that the unemployment rate rose to an almost three-year high in July.\n\nVolatility is already at a heightened level following a broad market selloff that briefly pushed the S&P 500 on the brink of a correction, or a nearly 10% drop from its July 16 all-time closing high.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 has since recovered some of its losses and currently sits about 6% away from its peak, traders are betting a weakening labor market will put the Federal Reserve solidly on a path to cut interest rates in September by almost a half-point, though traders midweek appear to be cashing in some of those futures and options bets for aggressive reductions this year.\n\nAfter rising by the most in nearly a year, initial claims are forecast to fall by 9,000 to 240,000 in the week ended Aug. 3, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Most of the increase the prior week was tied to annual auto-plant shutdowns and Hurricane Beryl, with claims elevated in Texas — the state that bore the brunt of the first major hurricane of the season.\n\nIf there is another move higher though, that may revive concerns that the Fed needs to shift to worrying about the employment part of its dual mandate following the most disruptive monetary tightening campaign in recent memory to battle inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Recession odds are higher as US economic data slows,” Kaiser added. “But the information received last week did not seem negative enough to justify the change in sentiment.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too How a Hip-Hop Pioneer Turned Breaking Into a Business Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest Why Elon Musk Is Vulnerable to AI\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Things have taken a turn for the worst in the stock market. After a pronounced selloff on Aug. 2, U.S. indices have continued to fall, with the the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average each falling more than 1,000 points at one point on Aug. 5.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 index has dropped 5% since the start of August and the Nasdaq is now in a correction defined as a 10% decline from recent highs.\n\nOverseas, things appear to be even worse. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 12% on Aug. 5 for its worst one-day performance since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987. It has since rebounded, however.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLeading European indices are down about 5% to begin August. The selloff appears to have been sparked by growing fears that the U.S. economy is entering a recession and that the U.S. Federal Reserve may not be able to cut interest rates fast enough to help matters.\n\nWithin this carnage, stocks tied to the artificial intelligence trade appear to be taking the biggest hit, with stocks of microchip and semiconductors being the most bludgeoned.\n\nLeading chip stocks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 10% at one point on Aug. 5, and those companies’ share prices are each down nearly 18% in the past month. But amid the current selloff, opportunities are sure to emerge.\n\nHere are the three best semiconductor stocks to buy in August 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) technology company. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing its 10-for-1 stock split in June of this year and subsequent downturn, Nvidia stock is now trading for $100 a share. The stock has declined 50% from its 52-week high of close to $200, including a 20% pullback since the start of July.\n\nMore than $500 billion has been erased from Nvidia’s market capitalization since before the stock split occurred less than two months ago.\n\nFor investors, the current situation presents a golden opportunity to buy a best-in-class technology stock, and the leading chip stock, at a decent price.\n\nNvidia stock is now trading more than 40% below the median price target that analysts have on its shares along with a consensus “strong buy” rating. Some rumors have surfaced that Nvidia’s newest Blackwell AI microchip might be delayed, but nothing has been confirmed by the company.\n\nNvidia next reports financial results on Aug. 28 and they are expected to be another blockbuster print.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nHit even harder than Nvidia amidst the current selloff has been Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM). The British chipmaker’s stock is down nearly 39% in the last month, including a 20% plunge since the beginning of August.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe selloff in ARM stock has been exacerbated by the company delivering weak forward guidance along with its recent Q2 financial results. The tepid guidance overwhelmed what was otherwise a strong print from the company.\n\nArm reported Q2 EPS of 40 cents versus 34 cents that had been forecast on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $939 million, which topped consensus estimates of $902.7 million.\n\nArm’s Q2 sales were up 39% from a year earlier. Management said that the company continues to benefit from strong global demand for its microchips and processors that are used in smartphones and AI applications.\n\nSadly, Arm maintained its full-year guidance that calls for $1.45 to $1.65 in earnings per share and $3.80 billion to $4.10 billion in revenue.\n\nAnalysts had $1.58 in earnings and sales of $4.02 billion penciled in for the company. In addition to its guidance falling short, Arm also said that it is no longer going to report the number of microchips that it ships globally starting in the current third quarter. That news also torpedoed the shares.\n\nHowever, ARM stock is worth buying on the way down. The company’s share price is still up 85% since its initial public offerin) last September.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took a drubbing both before and immediately after its Q2 financial results were released. However, it’s telling that AMD stock rose 2.50% on Aug. 5, a day when the Nasdaq index fell 3% or more than 500 points.\n\nInvestors clearly felt that AMD stock had declined enough and was worth more than where it was trading. Year-to-date, AMD stock is down 3% and ripe for the picking.\n\nAMD’s Q2 print was strong and showed accelerating sales of its AI microchips. The company announced EPS of 69 cents, which topped Wall Street forecasts of 68 cents. Sales in the quarter totaled $5.84 billion, which was ahead of consensus expectations of $5.72 billion.\n\nOwing to the brisk Q2 sales, AMD again raised its projection for sales of its AI chips this year, saying it now expects revenue to exceed $4.50 billion this year. Last fall, AMD forecast 2024 AI chip sales of $2 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding into various industries. However, not all companies have been able to benefit from this growth immediately. Lesser-known data center stocks, for example, are experiencing strong demand. This could substantially boost profits as big tech continues pouring billions into expanding AI capabilities.\n\nMassive AI development investments of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have largely aided infrastructure companies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) clearly succeeds as a manufacturer of the crucial chips powering AI. And, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) sees rising business from hardware sales.\r\n\r\nYet, according to Goldman Sachs, the data center stocks sector is expected to see the highest growth among all capital goods markets this year and through 2027. The bank forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% for data centers over the next three years.\n\nAs demand for AI surges, three data center stocks are well positioned for potentially exponential growth, with a solid focus on growing sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGDS Holdings (GDS) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nHong Kong-based GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS) develops and operates data centers in China and Southeast Asia. It is actively expanding its international footprint, so this could offer higher growth potential than its domestic market. The company has rapidly expanded its infrastructure capacity. The total area committed and pre-committed by customers rose by 5.4% year-over-year (YOY). Also, the area in service increased by 12.5% YOY.\n\nWhile sales increased 9.1% in the prior year and customer commitments grew, the company is not yet profitable. However, it heavily invests in building new facilities to meet demand and reduce backlogs. This strategy is well-aligned with Chinese government support for the tech and AI sectors, areas driving the growth of data center stocks.\r\n\r\nThe company remains undervalued relative to its potential. Its $8.09 billion enterprise value significantly exceeds its $2.15 billion market cap. This disparity helps explain analysts’ optimism, with all recent ratings recommending GDS stock as a buy. On average, price targets point to a 45% upside over the near term to $14.89 per share.\n\nVertiv (VRT) Abstract Futuristic infographic with Visual data complexity , represent Big data concept, node base programming. storage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVertiv (NASDAQ:VRT) provides critical digital infrastructure solutions as demand for data centers grows. The company designs and manufactures essential power management and cooling systems crucial for heat management. This includes advanced liquid cooling technologies that are becoming more prevalent as AI scales.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic investments in areas like AI and high-performance computing are expected to drive long-term demand for Vertiv. Data center spending is also growing substantially to support more digital services and complex data processing, which are integral to Vertiv’s business.\n\nVertiv has shown solid growth and execution. In its recent second quarter, the company posted EPS growth of 114.1% YOY and reported 12.6% revenue growth YOY. In addition, it raised its full-year outlook on strong demand and operations. The company has seen a 60% YOY increase in organic orders, largely from AI deployments.\n\nWith a record-high order backlog indicating future potential, Vertiv is well-positioned for continued growth. Analysts project an average price target of $105.37 per share, suggesting a 55% potential upside from current levels. This follows a 90% gain over the past year while it still trades 38% below its peak of $110 per share.\n\nSilicon Motion Techn ADR (SIMO) SIMO stock: Silicon Motion Technology logo on the side of its headquarters\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) manufactures solid-state memory drives that are key components used in data centers and other applications. The company expects its sales growth to be in the range of 25-30% this year. Recently, SIMO reported second-quarter earnings that showed a 15% sequential increase in quarterly revenue.\n\nShowing consistent revenue growth, Silicon Motion driven by strong demand for its NAND flash controllers and SSD solutions. For the full year 2024, it expects revenue between $800 million and $830 million, representing a 25% to 30% YOY increase. However, growth may be slightly delayed as the company implements new controller technology, after which it forecasts sales will return to increasing.\r\n\r\nSIMO stock trades at a relatively modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.6 times compared to the sector average of 34.1 times. Analysts believe SIMO stock has strong future prospects, with 11 out of 14 recommending buying it. The average analyst price target is $93.89 per share, implying a potential upside of as much as 58%.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top stocks on the market in the past year, delivering outstanding gains of 142% to investors as of this writing, but a closer look at this semiconductor giant's recent stock price action suggests that its stunning rally may have finally come to a halt.\n\nShares of Nvidia hit a 52-week high on June 20. However, the stock has pulled back by  22% since then. Concerns have been raised about Nvidia's expensive valuation and its ability to sustain its eye-popping growth beyond next year. Additionally, it looks like not all tech giants have been looking to get their hands on Nvidia's chips to train artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nApple, for instance, recently revealed that it used tensor processing units (TPUs) from Alphabet's Google division to train the large language model (LLM) powering its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features. That could have been a significant Nvidia contract, but AMD won the deal. Developments like this one seem to have weighed down Nvidia's stock lately.\n\nBut is this significant pullback an opportunity for savvy investors to buy this hot AI stock in anticipation that it could regain its mojo and deliver healthy gains once again in the coming year? Let's find out.\n\nAI chip demand is still solid, and this bodes well for Nvidia\n\nAnalysts estimate that Nvidia's share of the AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market stands between 70% and 95%. This puts the company in a robust position to capitalize on the healthy demand for AI accelerators, both in the short and the long run. For instance, recent results from Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) indicate that the hot demand for AI chips isn't going away.\n\nAMD witnessed a terrific 115% year-over-year increase in its data center revenue to $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2024. The company pointed out that this impressive increase was \"primarily driven by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPU shipments,\" which are AI accelerators deployed in data centers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMD sold just over $1 billion worth of its MI300 AI GPU in the previous quarter. AMD now expects to sell $4.5 billion worth of data center GPUs in 2024 as compared to the previous guidance of $4 billion. That's also a nice bump from the $3.5 billion data center GPU forecast AMD issued in January this year. This Nvidia rival is enjoying robust success right now.\n\nThat's not the end of Nvidia's growth, though. Nvidia is a much bigger player than AMD in the data center GPU market, and it is also growing at a much faster pace. Nvidia sold $22.6 billion worth of data center chips in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with its revenue from this segment rising a whopping 427% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two reasons why Nvidia clocked such phenomenal data center growth. First, we have seen that the company commands a dominant position in this market. Second, the size of the AI chip market is growing at a solid annual rate of 68%, according to market research firm TechNavio. The firm estimates that the AI chip market could grow by $390 billion between 2023 and 2028, which is why it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's business continue growing at a healthy pace in the future.\n\nInvestors can expect solid gains over the next year\n\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that Nvidia could generate $204 billion in revenue in calendar year 2025 (which will coincide with the majority of its fiscal year 2026). For comparison, Nvidia is expected to deliver $120 billion in revenue in the current fiscal year 2025. So, Arcuri's estimate points toward a jump of 70% in Nvidia's revenue in the next fiscal year.\n\nArcuri's estimate is based on the healthy demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell generation of AI chips. The analyst points out that data center operators are placing huge orders for liquid-cooled server racks to house Nvidia's Blackwell chips. As a result, Nvidia could ship 69,000 Blackwell-based systems next year, generating $9 billion in revenue for every 5,000 such systems that it ships.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia could generate $4.95 per share in earnings in 2025. Again, that's well above the $3.74 per share consensus estimate for fiscal 2026 (which coincides with 11 months of the calendar year 2025). Assuming Nvidia's fiscal 2026 earnings end up at the consensus estimate of $3.74 per share, its stock price could increase to $161 next year based on its forward earnings multiple of 43 (which represents a discount to the U.S. technology sector's earnings multiple of 45).\n\nThat would be a 50% increase from current levels. However, if Nvidia's earnings get close to Arcuri's estimate, investors could expect more upside from this semiconductor stock. That's why savvy investors could consider using Nvidia's pullback to buy more shares as its recent weakness could be temporary thanks to the massive AI opportunity it is sitting on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How chip giant Intel spurned OpenAI and fell behind the times",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For U.S. chip giant Intel, the darling of the computer age before it fell on harder times in the AI era, things might have been quite different.\n\nAbout seven years ago, the company had the chance to buy a stake in OpenAI, then a fledgling non-profit research organization working in a little-known field called generative artificial intelligence, four people with direct knowledge of those discussions told Reuters.\n\nOver several months in 2017 and 2018, executives at the two companies discussed various options, including Intel buying a 15% stake for $1 billion in cash, three of the people said. They also discussed Intel taking an additional 15% stake in OpenAI if it made hardware for the startup at cost price, two people said.\n\nIntel ultimately decided against a deal, partly because then-CEO Bob Swan did not think generative AI models would make it to market in the near future and thus repay the chipmaker's investment, according to three of the sources, who all requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.\n\nOpenAI was interested in an investment from Intel because it would have reduced their reliance on Nvidia's chips and allowed the startup to build its own infrastructure, two of the people said. The deal also fell through because Intel's data center unit did not want to make products at cost, the people added.\n\nAn Intel spokesperson did not address questions about the potential deal. Swan did not respond to a request for comment and OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nIntel's decision not to invest in OpenAI, which went on to launch the groundbreaking ChatGPT in 2022 and is now reportedly valued at about $80 billion, has not previously been made public.\n\nIt is among a series of strategic misfortunes that have seen the company, which was at the cutting edge of computer chips in the 1990s and 2000s, stumble in the era of AI, according to Reuters interviews with nine people familiar with the matter including former Intel executives and industry experts.\n\nLast week, Intel's second-quarter earnings triggered a stock price decline of more than a quarter of its value in its worst trading day since 1974.\n\nFor the first time in 30 years, the tech company is worth less than $100 billion. The erstwhile market kingpin - whose marketing slogan \"Intel Inside\" long represented the gold standard of quality - is still struggling to get a blockbuster AI chip product to market.\n\nIntel is now dwarfed by $2.6 trillion rival Nvidia, which has pivoted from video game graphics to AI chips needed to build, train and operate large generative AI systems like OpenAI's GPT4 and Meta Platforms' Llama models. Intel has also fallen behind the $218 billion AMD.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked about its AI progress, the Intel spokesperson referred to recent comments by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who said the company's third-generation Gaudi AI chip, which it aims to launch in the third quarter of this year, would outperform rivals.\n\nGelsinger said the company had \"20-plus\" customers for the second and third generation of Gaudi and that its next-generation Falcon Shores AI chip would launch in late 2025.\n\n\"We are nearing the completion of a historic pace of design and process technology innovation, and we are encouraged by the product pipeline we're building to capture a greater share of the AI market going forward,\" the spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nGAMING CHIPS SWEEP AI\n\nOn the OpenAI front, Microsoft stepped in to make an investment in 2019, propelling itself to the forefront of the AI era triggered by the 2022 release of ChatGPT and a frenzy of activity among the largest companies in the world to deploy AI.\n\nAlthough in hindsight the prospective deal was a missed chance for Intel, the company has been gradually losing the battle for AI supremacy for more than decade, according to the former executives and industry experts interviewed.\n\n\"Intel failed in AI because they didn't present a cohesive product strategy to their customers,\" said Dylan Patel, founder of semiconductor research group SemiAnalysis.\n\nFor more than two decades, Intel believed the CPU, or central processing unit, like the ones that power desktop and laptop computers, could more effectively handle the processing tasks required to build and run AI models, according to four former Intel executives with direct knowledge of the company's plans.\n\nIntel engineers viewed the graphics processing unit (GPU) video gaming chip architecture, used by rivals Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, as comparatively \"ugly,\" one of the people said.\n\nBy the mid 2000s, though, researchers had discovered that the gaming chips were far more efficient than CPUs at handling the intensive data crunching necessary to build and train large AI models. Because GPUs are designed for game graphics, they can perform an enormous number of calculations in parallel.\n\nNvidia's engineers have spent years since then modifying the GPU architecture to tune them for AI uses, and built the software necessary to harness the capabilities.\n\n\"When AI hit ... Intel just didn't have the right processor at the right time,\" said Lou Miscioscia, analyst at Japanese investment bank Daiwa.\n\nNERVANA AND HABANA\n\nSince 2010, Intel has made at least four attempts to produce a viable AI chip, including acquiring two startups and at least two major homegrown efforts. None have made a dent against Nvidia or AMD in the rapidly expanding and lucrative market, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company's internal activities.\n\nIntel's entire data center business is expected to generate sales of $13.89 billion this year - which includes the company's AI chips but many other designs too - while analysts expect Nvidia to generate data center revenue of $105.9 billion.\n\nIn 2016, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich sought to buy its way into the AI business by acquiring Nervana Systems for $408 million. Intel executives were attracted to Nervana's technology, which was similar to a tensor processing unit (TPU) chip made by Google, according to two former executives.\n\nThe TPU - specifically designed for building, or training, large generative AI models - stripped away a conventional GPU's features useful for video games and focused exclusively on optimizing AI calculations.\n\nNervana enjoyed some success with customers including Meta Platforms for its processor, though not enough to prevent Intel from switching horses and abandoning the project.\n\nIn 2019, Intel bought a second chip startup, Habana Labs, for $2 billion before it shut down Nervana's efforts in 2020.\n\nKrzanich did not respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nTuesday's gains left investors with two questions: \"Is the selling over?\" and \"When should I buy?\"\n\nWall Street thinks the worst is over, but to truly wrap our heads around what's going on we must voyage overseas to Japan to study the so-called carry trade.\n\nThat's because the Japanese yen has found itself tightly correlated with US tech stocks — which have been powering the market this year.\n\nCurrencies fluctuate relative to each other largely based on interest rate differentials, haven flows during times of panic, and international trade.\n\nJapan has been mired in a decades-long deflationary spiral, from which it is only now climbing out, and its rates have correspondingly hovered around the zero line for decades. As the world's last holdout with negative rates, it climbed into positive territory only this year when it hiked to 0.1% in March — then again last week to 0.25%. Global Central Bank Policy Rates\n\nMeanwhile, rates in the US have been north of 5% for a year and the European Central Bank sits just under 4%, having cut in June.\n\nOut of this large gap, an entire cottage industry of investors emerged who borrow cheaply in Japan, then reinvest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. It's called the carry trade.\n\nEd Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, joined Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief show to break down the particulars.\n\n\"[A] lot of speculators went and borrowed in Japan at zero interest rates,\" said Yardeni, who explained that the borrowed yen was then converted into dollars and other currencies.\n\n\"The yen weakened, the dollar strengthened, and they took that money and invested it in assets around the world,\" he said.\n\nSince 2010, this persistent selling pressure on the yen, combined with the corresponding bid on the US dollar, has made the dollar twice as valuable as the yen — a stupendously large move for a developed-world currency.\n\nThe crashing yen even led the Bank of Japan to intervene at times, but ultra-low rates encourage capital flight. And now that the BOJ is raising rates, the engines are reversing, along with the international money flows back into the yen.\n\nLeverage and volatility act as masochistic siblings, feeding on each other during times of strife — wiping out pyramided positions. Movements that would normally take months occur in the span of a few days.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkets survived the first round of margin calls Monday and Tuesday, but bear markets don't occur overnight. When looking for clues about future direction, investors should also consider the backdrop in US markets.\n\nIn the back half of July, investor portfolios had already been subjected to a gut-wrenching rotation from megacaps into small caps and value sectors.\n\nThrow in some recession fears stoked by softening US economic numbers along with a Fed chair with an index finger on the \"cut\" button, and investors themselves were quick to press \"sell.\"\n\nWall Street is leaning toward a fairly quick resolution of the episode. Morgan Stanley's sales desk wrote to clients, \"We are closer to the end of the selling than to the beginning.\" JPMorgan's co-head of FX strategy Arindam Sandilya believes we're 50% to 60% through the carry unwind as of Monday.\n\nFor his part, Yardeni sees the end a bit sooner: \"The unwind should be over by the end of the week.\" morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

The stock, which soared nearly 150% in the first half of the year, slid 11% in two trading sessions, closing on Monday at about $100. It's impossible to predict whether this general market sell-off will continue or to say with 100% certainty that we've reached a bottom. But in either case, the question is: Should you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia right now? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's market performance\n\nFirst, let's talk a bit about Nvidia's stock market performance. The shares not only advanced in the first half, but they'd been soaring for quite some time thanks to the company's triple-digit earnings growth. Nvidia dominates the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, holding 80% share. This is a particularly big deal considering the high demand for AI products today.\n\nNvidia shares have advanced 2,500% over five years, prompting the company to launch a 10-for-1 stock split back in June to bring them down to earth. A stock split lowers the per-share price through the issuance of more shares to current holders. This doesn't change anything fundamental about a company, but it makes it easier for a broader range of investors to access the shares.\n\nSince the split, when Nvidia stock opened at about $120, the stock has dropped 17%. Seeing this decline, even prior to the sell-off, investors started wondering whether the stock was starting to lose momentum. On top of this, reports of a potential delay in the launch of Nvidia's new Blackwell chip might be weighing on investors' minds.\n\nMeanwhile, as mentioned, the overall market has stumbled over the past few days, roiled by concerns about the economy. Technology and growth stocks have led declines, as they're most vulnerable during times of economic troubles. The growth of these players generally depends on customers having the budgets to buy their products and services, and they also rely on borrowing to expand. So it's clear they could be among the first to suffer during tough times.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia now?\n\nNow, let's consider what you should do about Nvidia. Even when a market environment looks uncertain, it's always important to take a long-term view of stocks and your portfolio. History shows that bull markets, bear markets, sell-offs, and any market environment are temporary situations. Highs and lows come and go, but the fantastic news is market growth has always won out. If we look at the major indexes over time, they've always gone on to gain after tough periods.\n\nStory continues ^SPX Chart\n\n^SPX data by YCharts.\n\nThis means, if a particular company has what it takes to withstand a difficult environment and the company's long-term prospects are solid, you'll want to hang onto that player. And that's why Nvidia makes a great buy or hold today. Plus, if you're buying, you'll pick up the shares at a very reasonable level of 37 times forward-earnings estimates, down from nearly 50 times just a few weeks ago.\n\nNvidia is a leader in a high-growth market, AI, and this market is in the early stages of its growth story. Analysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market will reach beyond $1 trillion later this decade. Nvidia should benefit thanks to its leadership and its focus on innovation to maintain this position. That's why, during this market sell-off, Nvidia makes a fantastic stock to add to any long-term growth portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 7, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.\n\nAre AI Stocks Still a Buy?\n\nThe AI trade has cooled off in recent weeks, with many of the notable companies involved in the trade, including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, facing adverse price action.\n\nThe recent pressure raises a valid question: Is the selling overdone? Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nNvidia Maintains Bright Outlook\n\nNvidia is the last of the beloved Mag 7 group to report Q2 results, which are expected to hit the tape in late August. Recent quarterly results have been overwhelmingly positive, with earnings and sales continuing to melt higher amid unrelenting demand.\n\nNonetheless, the outlook for its current fiscal year hasn’t changed at all, with the $2.69 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 73% over the last year and suggesting 105% Y/Y growth. Revenue revisions also remain highly favorable.\n\nEarnings and sales revisions for the upcoming release have also remained highly positive, with the company again expected to post immense growth. Concerning Data Center expectations, the Zacks Consensus estimate presently sits at $24.6 billion, surpassing last year’s mark of $10.3 billion.\n\nData Center results have regularly blown away our consensus estimates, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion.\n\nWhile the stock has faced pressure, it certainly does not reflect the robust fundamentals beneath the hood. The stock remains at the heart of the AI trade, undoubtedly a prime selection for anybody seeking exposure.\n\nIn addition, breakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 32.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Further, the current PEG ratio works out to a historically low 0.9X, reflecting that investors aren’t overpaying for the forecasted growth.\n\nAMD Reports Record Data Center Results\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices recently released its latest quarterly results, exceeding both Zacks Consensus EPS and sales expectations.\n\nMost importantly, the company’s AI outlook remains notably bright. CEO Lisa Su stated, ‘Our AI business continued accelerating and we are well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth in the second half of the year led by demand for Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen processors. The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market, creating significant growth opportunities as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our business.’\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD’s Data Center sales of $2.8 billion reflected a quarterly record, climbing an astonishing 115% from the same period last year. As shown below, the company has chained together back-to-back beats on the metric, snapping a streak of negativity.\n\nStill, it’s critical to note that AMD saw negative revisions for its current fiscal year hit the tape following the release, with the now $3.35 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 26% year-over-year growth. Expectations have been trending lower overall over the last year.\n\nLike NVDA, valuation multiples aren’t stretched, with the current 1.1X PEG ratio also reflecting a fair price for the forecasted growth.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have faced pressure over the near term, their quarterly results and demand being experienced paint a highly positive picture for long-term gains.\n\nAs shown above, these stocks' respective PEG ratios reflect a fair price, shifting the valuation question out of the picture. Simply put, the recent selling has certainly been spooky, but it does not change their current stories.\n\nBoth remain prime buys for those seeking AI exposure, but Nvidia’s more positive earnings outlook does put it above Advanced Micro Devices from a near-term perspective.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Tuesday as a rebound rally ran out of steam, while technology stocks faced renewed weakness on more disappointing chipmaker earnings.\n\nLosses in futures came after Wall Street indexes recovered a measure of recent losses, amid some bargain buying. But sentiment remained tenuous amid persistent concerns over slowing growth and middling earnings.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.4% to 5,246.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.5% to 18,091.75 points by 19:19 ET (23:19 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 39,051.0 points.\n\nSuper Micro earnings disappoint, tech stocks fall\n\nData center operator Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) plunged nearly 13% in aftermarket trade as its June quarter earnings missed estimates, raising more concerns over just how much demand the artificial intelligence industry was generating.\n\nWhile the firm did forecast better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, its shares saw little support.\n\nSoft earnings from Super Micro sparked aftermarket losses in broader technology stocks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is a client of the firm, sank 2.3%, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 1%.\n\nLosses in technology stocks were a major factor behind a recent rout in Wall Street, as mixed earnings from tech heavyweights such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) sparked concerns over slowing returns from AI.\n\nInvestors also locked-in strong profits in tech stocks after hype over AI drove a major valuation spike in the past year.\n\nWall Street recovers some bruising losses\n\nWall Street indexes rose on Tuesday, recovering a measure of bruising losses clocked over the past week, amid concerns over a U.S. recession and a tech slowdown.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1% to 5,240.03 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 1% to 16,358.17 points, with both indexes rising from three-month lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% to 38,997.66 points.\n\nSentiment towards risk-driven assets remained frail. But the prospect of lower interest rates in the coming months offered some support, as markets bet that worsening economic conditions will spur the Federal Reserve into cutting rates more than initially expected.\n\nMore key earnings are on tap this week, with media giant Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) set to report on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures fall as rebound rally cools, tech retreats\n\nEarnings call: JLL posts strong Q2 with revenue growth amid market shifts\n\nEarnings call: Starwood Property Trust reports solid Q2 earnings amid diversification\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Exclusive-Samsung's 8-layer HBM3E chips clear Nvidia's tests for use, sources say",
        "content": "By Fanny Potkin and Heekyong Yang\n\nSINGAPORE/SEOUL - A version of Samsung Electronics' fifth-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, or HBM3E, has passed Nvidia's tests for use in its artificial intelligence (AI) processors, three sources briefed on the results said.\n\nThe qualification clears a major hurdle for the world's biggest memory chipmaker which has been struggling to catch up with local rival SK Hynix in the race to supply the advanced memory chips capable of handling generative AI work.\n\nSamsung and Nvidia have yet to sign a supply deal for the approved eight-layer HBM3E chips but will do so soon, the sources said, adding that they expect supplies would start by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe South Korean technology giant's 12-layer version of HBM3E chips, however, has yet to pass Nvidia's tests, the sources said, declining to be identified as the matter remains confidential.\n\nBoth Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nHBM is a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. A key component of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI, it helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex applications.\n\nSamsung has been seeking to pass Nvidia's tests for HBM3E and preceding fourth-generation HBM3 models since last year but has struggled due to heat and power consumption issues, Reuters reported in May, citing sources.\n\nThe company has since reworked its HBM3E design to address those issues, according to the sources who were briefed on the matter.\n\nSamsung said after the publication of the Reuters article in May that claims its chips had failed Nvidia's tests due to heat and power consumption problems were untrue.\n\nThe latest test approval follows Nvidia's recent certification of Samsung's HBM3 chips for use in less sophisticated processors developed for the Chinese market, which Reuters reported last month.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's approval of Samsung's latest HBM chips comes amid soaring demand for sophisticated GPUs created by the generative AI boom that Nvidia and other makers of AI chipsets are struggling to meet.\n\nHBM3E chips are likely to become the mainstream HBM product in the market this year with shipments concentrated in the second half, according to research firm TrendForce. SK Hynix, the leading manufacturer, estimates demand for HBM memory chips in general could increase at an annual rate of 82% through 2027.\n\nSamsung forecast in July that HBM3E chips would make up 60% of its HBM chip sales by the fourth-quarter, a target that many analysts say could be achieved if its latest HBM chips passed Nvidia's final approval by the third quarter.\n\nSamsung does not provide revenue breakdowns for specific chip products. Samsung's total DRAM chip revenue was estimated at 22.5 trillion won ($16.4 billion) for the first six months of this year, according to a Reuters' survey of 15 analysts, and some said about 10% of that could be from HBM sales.\n\nThere are only three main manufacturers of HBM - SK Hynix, Micron and Samsung.\n\nSK Hynix has been the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and supplied HBM3E chips in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources had said earlier.\n\nMicron has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E chips.\n\n($1 = 1,375.6400 won)\n\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Heekyong Yang in Seoul; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Miral Fahmy)",

        "title": "The Top 3 EV Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "If you live in a city or large metropolitan area, finding an electric vehicle charging station is likely no problem. Most hookups are located on both coasts.\n\nHead into the interior, though, and it becomes more dicey. Selling EVs to people with few battery charging options will make them a tough sell. And it is getting more difficult.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported a 5% drop in sales last month to 444,000. Its EV market share fell below 50% for the first time hitting 49.7%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the overall EV market is still growing, it is just growing more slowly than it was. There are a couple of reasons for that.\n\nAs the biggest EV stock, Tesla is going to skew the results. If its sales fall it will look like the entire market is down when, in fact, other EV makers are reporting increases. But the industry still has problems.\n\nRange anxiety, or how far someone can drive before needing to recharge a battery, is a real concern. So is the price. According to Kelley Blue Book, a new EV costs on average about $56,000 while new gas-powered cars go for around $48,000. Although the gap is narrowing, a large chasm of affordability remains.\n\nA base fossil fuel Ford (NYSE:F) F-150 has an MSRP of $37,000 while the electric F-150 Lightning starts at $63,000. For that $26,000 difference, you could throw in an extra Ford Escape.\n\nAlso, cheaper cars will have smaller batteries that have less range. Luxury vehicles with bigger batteries are just priced out of the range of the average car buyer’s wallet.\n\nWhile the EV market is slowing, several EV stocks are still worth buying. These three are the best.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota (NYSE:TM) is not only the world’s largest automaker but also the biggest hybrid vehicle manufacturer. As that market has become the sweet spot for EVs, Toyota is dominating. It reported a 63% surge in U.S. EV sales in the second quarter to 247,347 vehicles. It represents 40% of all vehicles sold, almost all of which were hybrids. Over the first six months of 2024, Toyota EV sales were up 68% (its Lexus division accounts for about 13% of the total).\n\nAlthough Toyota sold fewer vehicles than Tesla, the Japanese automaker clearly has its finger on the pulse of what EV car buyers are looking for. Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) agree. They stepped on the brakes of their battery EV dreams and are transitioning production to hybrid manufacturing.\n\nToyota stock is down only 5% in 2024 as it deals with inventory issues. Demand for its vehicles is so great it can’t keep up and is losing out on sales. However, it just reported a 17% increase in profits to 1.3 trillion yen ($8.7 billion). Despite that matching analyst expectations, Reuters reports it marks the lowest growth in the last seven quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares, though, are cheap. They go for 8 times earnings and estimates and a fraction of its sales. The market offering investors such a discount makes Toyota one of the top EV stocks to buy.\n\nVolkswagen (VWAGY) A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.\n\nSource: multitel / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are arguably fewer companies doing more in EVs than Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY). Not necessarily in building EVs themselves but rather in partnering with others to develop the best technology for its vehicles.\n\nFor example, Volkswagen has invested almost $400 million in solid-state battery maker QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) to help it advance its next-generation battery technology. VW’s battery division PowerCo also just received a license to mass-produce QuantumScape’s battery cells.\n\nThe German automaker also agreed to invest as much as $5 billion in electric SUV maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) in exchange for its advanced software-defined vehicle (SDV) platforms to be used by both companies.\n\nVolkswagen’s plan seems to be to partner with and acquire battery technology and platforms that it can use across its own EV lineup. As a deep-pocketed investor, it can gain significant leverage with these cash-strapped startups.\n\nIt also recently announced a partnership with China’s Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) to produce two new EVs for the country that will feature VW branding.\n\nYet Volkswagen’s stock is down 13% this year as it works to regain its footing, despite having a portfolio of well-known auto brands including Audi, Porsche and Bentley. This could be an excellent opportunity to buy into a business leveraging its size for future gain.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) electric vehicles at a recharging station\n\nSource: Sopotnicki / Shutterstock.com\n\nBetter than trying to pick a winner out of the many EV stocks on the market, why not buy a basket of them? The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NYSEARCA:DRIV) is not wholly focused on the EV market but also gives you a selection of adjacent technology stocks.\n\nThe exchange-traded fund naturally includes EV stocks like Tesla, Lucid, Xpeng and Nio (NYSE:NIO) but also holds Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which owns the autonomous vehicle company Waymo. Additionally, the ETF owns chipmakers including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), as well as lithium miners such as Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) and hydrogen fuel cell maker Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE).\n\nGlobal X has net assets of around $420 million and carries a reasonable expense ratio of 0.68%. It also pays a semi-annual dividend of 41 cents that currently yields 1.9% annually. As it allows you to spread the risk of investing in EV stocks, the ETF is a good choice for many investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Could See Incredible Growth in August and Beyond",
        "content": "In 2024, AI stocks remain crucial as generative AI and machine learning continue to be key drivers of investor interest. Despite market fluctuations, AI stocks have shown resilience, even in these uncertain times. And while many top AI names have seen significant declines from their recent peaks, it’s important to zoom out. The stocks I’m highlighting below are up an incredible amount from their more recent troughs. I think this momentum is likely to continue long-term.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s recent stance has boosted confidence in growth stocks, with interest rates likely to be cut in short order. And as growing business adoption of AI technologies continues to advance, further demand growth and innovation are likely to accelerate over time.\n\nAI has dominated earnings discussions this year, with companies investing billions to integrate AI into their offerings. Here’s why these three AI stocks should still top investors’ watch lists right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) brief “relief rally” ended as the stock fell 7% on Friday, hitting its lowest since May. This drop wiped out earlier gains amid tech sector declines, with the Nasdaq officially entering correction territory due to an economic slowdown and fears of AI overspending.\n\nHowever, increased AI investment is seen as a catalyst for Nvidia and other AI chipmakers. This is a factor that’s undebatable, and one that’s driven the stock to incredible heights this year, with Nvidia briefly taking the mantle of the world’s largest company.\n\nWall Street experts continue to drive home the idea that the AI trade remains strong despite a recent pullback. Many view this current dip as one worth buying. Given the long-term growth assigned to AI applications, it should drive incredible demand for high-performance chips. Nvidia’s status as the leading high-performance chip maker should position the company for strong growth long-term. And with most major tech names continuing to order billions of dollars of chips each quarter from Nvidia, this demand does appear to remain sustainable over time.\n\nThat’s not to say there aren’t risks. Nvidia’s upcoming earnings face scrutiny amid Taiwan-China tensions and Big Tech volatility. Developing a China-specific chip could mitigate regulatory issues. That said, analysts remain optimistic and confident that Nvidia will remain the dominant force in the AI chip sector. I agree.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July, ASMLHoldings (NASDAQ:ASML) stock fell despite beating earnings estimates. The company’s stock was weighed down by export restriction fears and a shift from chip stocks to small caps.\n\nOn July 31, news that ASML might be excluded from new U.S. export restrictions lifted its stock, as nearly half of its sales come from China. The U.S. reportedly plans to expand the foreign direct product rule but exclude key allies like Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea. However, exports to China from Israel, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia will be impacted.\n\nAs one of the biggest names in the semiconductor sector, in Q2 ASML reported a 6.2 billion euro net sales, skyrocketing ahead estimates. System sales reached  4.8 billion euro. Installed base management generated 1.48 billion euro, highlighting strong service revenue. Logic and memory sales made up 54% and 46% of system sales, respectively, driven by advanced chip demand.\n\nAdditionally, Advanced Micro Devices‘ (NASDAQ:AMD) strong revenue growth and Barclays upgraded rating boosted chip stocks, including ASML. Over time, I think more positive upgrades will be forthcoming due to ASML’s status as a picks-and-shovels way to play the chips space. For those looking to truly play the broader macro trend behind chip development and growth, ASML stock could be the best way to do so.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) surged 264% in Q1. It remains up 220.1% for the year, despite a 21% drop in Q2. The stock has been a clear beneficiary of AI growth. It is seeing an incredible surge tied to impressive demand for the company’s servers and storage solutions business. With the company’s direct liquid cooling technology, few competitors can come close to providing the sort of scale and growth potential of Super Micro.\n\nIn its fiscal third quarter, Super Micro earned $855 million ($15.68 per share) on $9.6 billion in revenue, up 95% year-over-year. The company raised its Q4 revenue forecast to $5.1 billion to $5.6 billion and full-year guidance to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion, exceeding initial estimates. Results for Q4 and the full year are expected around August 13.\n\nOn August 3, SMCI stock fell over 4% despite announcing a new Nvidia Omniverse SuperCluster. This enhanced system featuring Supermicro’s Nvidia OVX and generative AI workflows aims to boost AI workload scalability. CEO Charles Liang highlighted that this SuperCluster integrates advanced GPU capabilities for high performance and future innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Are AI Stocks Still a Buy? NVDA, AMD",
        "content": "The AI trade has cooled off in recent weeks, with many of the notable companies involved in the trade, including Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD, facing adverse price action.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last month. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe recent pressure raises a valid question: Is the selling overdone? Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nNvidia Maintains Bright Outlook\n\nNvidia is the last of the beloved Mag 7 group to report Q2 results, which are expected to hit the tape in late August. Recent quarterly results have been overwhelmingly positive, with earnings and sales continuing to melt higher amid unrelenting demand.\n\nNonetheless, the outlook for its current fiscal year hasn’t changed at all, with the $2.69 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 73% over the last year and suggesting 105% Y/Y growth. Revenue revisions also remain highly favorable. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings and sales revisions for the upcoming release have also remained highly positive, with the company again expected to post immense growth. Concerning Data Center expectations, the Zacks Consensus estimate presently sits at $24.6 billion, surpassing last year’s mark of $10.3 billion.\n\nAs shown below, Data Center results have regularly blown away our consensus estimates, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhile the stock has faced pressure, it certainly does not reflect the robust fundamentals beneath the hood. The stock remains at the heart of the AI trade, undoubtedly a prime selection for anybody seeking exposure.\n\nIn addition, breakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 32.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Further, the current PEG ratio works out to a historically low 0.9X, reflecting that investors aren’t overpaying for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD Reports Record Data Center Results\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices recently released its latest quarterly results, exceeding both Zacks Consensus EPS and sales expectations.\n\nMost importantly, the company’s AI outlook remains notably bright. CEO Lisa Su stated, ‘Our AI business continued accelerating and we are well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth in the second half of the year led by demand for Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen processors. The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market, creating significant growth opportunities as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our business.’\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD’s Data Center sales of $2.8 billion reflected a quarterly record, climbing an astonishing 115% from the same period last year. As shown below, the company has chained together back-to-back beats on the metric, snapping a streak of negativity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, it’s critical to note that AMD saw negative revisions for its current fiscal year hit the tape following the release, with the now $3.35 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 26% year-over-year growth. Expectations have been trending lower overall over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike NVDA, valuation multiples aren’t stretched, with the current 1.1X PEG ratio also reflecting a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile both Nvidia NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices AMD have faced pressure over the near term, their quarterly results and demand being experienced paint a highly positive picture for long-term gains.\n\nAs shown above, these stocks' respective PEG ratios reflect a fair price, shifting the valuation question out of the picture. Simply put, the recent selling has certainly been spooky, but it does not change their current stories.\n\nBoth remain prime buys for those seeking AI exposure, but Nvidia’s more positive earnings outlook does put it above Advanced Micro Devices from a near-term perspective.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "On Monday, NVIDIA NVDA shares fell more than 6%, contributing to a considerable valuation wipeout of more than $650 billion for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks during the market plunge. This iconic group of seven stocks has collectively lost about $1.3 trillion in market cap over the past three trading sessions.\n\nThere were some company-specific news that impacted the tech world. A judge ruled that Google’s search and ad businesses violated antitrust laws, contributing to a decline in its share price. Apple AAPL declined more than 4% after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) disclosed that it had reduced its stake in the iPhone maker by half (read: ETFs in Focus as Buffett Cuts Apple Stake by Nearly 50%).\n\nNVIDIA plunged as much as 13% at market open. Analysts are worried about the delay of NVIDIA’s next-generation AI chips by three months, which could affect its major customers, including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta. The semiconductor sector has been hit hard, with Intel INTC shares plummeting massively following a disappointing second-quarter earnings report.\n\nGil Luria from D.A. Davidson pointed out that NVIDIA’s window to capitalize on data center expansions by companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta will close at one point in time, told Yahoo Finance Monday. No wonder, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite entered correction territory. Plus, the July jobs report showed slower jobs growth and a nearly three-year high unemployment rate.\n\nTime to Buy the Tech Stock Dip?\n\nThe AI rally is still hot. In a 2024 McKinsey survey, 39% of respondents saw lower costs resulting from AI adoption in their organization, according to Forbes. This means that over the long run, the AI business may prove to be at least a volume-driven revenue engine, if not realization-driven.\n\nMeanwhile, investments in AI are being made in full stride by big tech companies, sensing the potential. So, if you are not buying the momentum now, you may miss out on an opportunity. And by the time, you want to jump into the AI initiative, the move might already be priced in. Agreed, the current slump is worrying some investors. But these are probably healthy corrections.\n\nAre ETFs Better Bets Than Individual Stocks?\n\nAll big techs are investing billions in AI, but not everyone is tasting the same success. Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT fired on all cylinders in its initial days of launch in late 2022. OpenAI has now posed its most direct challenge yet to Alphabet’s Google through the launch of a search engine that uses artificial intelligence baked in from the beginning.\n\nHowever, we are yet to be sure that OpenAI will be seen as great a success in Internet search as Google. While Alphabet initially stumbled on the Gen-AI initiative, Google has made the Gemini AI free version faster with a 1.5 flash update.\n\nFed to Cut Rates Sooner Than Expected?\n\nOverall, the AI rally seems to have more room for growth. Plus, the Fed might cut rates earlier than expected due to downbeat jobs reports. Tech stocks perform better in a low-rate environment. Inflation is also cooling.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, you can buy tech exchange-traded funds (ETF) like Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, VanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW on the dip.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia’s Jensen Huang didn’t get hurt in the selloff—he sold $360 million in stock before it declined",
        "content": "On a near-daily basis, billionaire entrepreneur Jensen Huang is selling hundreds of thousands of shares in his company, Nvidia.\n\nHuang's selloff strategy was put in place in early spring, and it has meant the CEO avoided being hit as hard now the value of his chipmaking company has begun to fall.\n\nFor example, in late June Nvidia's shares sat pretty as the darling of Wall Street, valued at approximately $124 a share.\n\nIn July, this leapt to a near-all-time high of $134. 91, before beginning to dip in the second half of the month. Currently, Nvidia shares are down to approximately $100—a benchmark it last reached in May of this year.\n\nBut Huang's portfolio strategy meant he began selling his equity in regular blocks of 120,000 shares each when the company's price was high.\n\nIn July alone Huang offloaded approximately $323 million in Nvidia stock—and near $361 million if one counts the first week of August.\n\nHuang also sold his usual 120,000 shares the day Nvidia's share price hit an all-time high of $135.58 in June, when the market value of the sale hit $16.08 million per an SEC filing seen by Fortune.\n\nHowever, across some 25 SEC filings viewed by Fortune between early July and the time of writing, the values of sales of these blocks of 120,000 shares oscillated anywhere between $11.98 million and $16.09 million.\n\nFrom July to the time of writing, the average value of Huang's daily sale was $14.44 million.\n\nNvidia declined to comment when reached by Fortune.\n\nWorld's richest lost $134 billion\n\nWhile Huang's timing is fortuitous in some aspects, it was laid out well in advance of any fluctuations in Nvidia's stock price.\n\nA regulatory filing seen by Fortune reveals that Huang announced he had a Rule 10b5-1 trading agreement on March 14, with sales possible through to March 31, 2025.\n\nThe arrangement means executives like Huang—and any other business insiders—buy or sell their company stock on a predetermined schedule without violating insider trading laws.\n\nHuang wasn't the only Nvidia exec to confirm a Rule 10b5-1 trading agreement in the April filing.\n\nDebora Shoquist, executive vice president of operations; Colette M. Kress, executive vice president and CFO; and Ajay K. Puri, executive vice president of worldwide field operations, disclosed similar plans.\n\nAnd while the offload of Huang's stocks are worth millions on a daily basis, that hasn't insulated the CEO entirely from the faltering of the market in recent weeks.\n\nAt the peak of his net worth in June—corresponding with Nvidia's share price peak—Huang was worth $119 billion per the Bloomberg's Billionaire Index.\n\nStory continues\n\nLess than two months later that net worth has fallen to $88.4 billion, placing him at 15th on the world's richest rankings.\n\nThat said, the bulk of Huang's worth is still made up of shares in the California-based chip giant he worked tirelessly to build. Huang still owns approximately 3.5% of the company.\n\nEvery high-profile name among the world's richest currently has a red mark beside it, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg all take a hit to their fortunes amid volatility in the markets.\n\nThe world’s 500 richest people saw at least $134 billion wiped from their fortunes overnight after upset in the markets prompted by a less than positive labor report Friday.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 Index fell 2.4% on the final day of trading last week, dragging down the net worth of all 10 of the richest people in the world by at least $1 billion per Bloomberg’s calculations.\n\nExperts at the Futurum Group—a tech industry research and advisory firm—told the Financial Times the bearishness is likely just a rotation out of sectors which have performed well over the course of the year, as opposed to anything relating to Nvidia's fundamentals.\n\n“We’ve seen money flow out of Big Tech mostly, I think, because they have had an incredible run-up,” CEO Daniel Newman said, “and that, of course, gave room for a little bit of a selloff.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street sees ‘buying opportunity’ amid AI pullback",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks, a hallmark of the recent bull market run, have lost steam over the past month.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) are all down more than 15% over the period amid a broader market sell-off that's seen the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) decline more than 10% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 8%. Even as investors have begun to question recent earnings results from the group, some strategists don't think this is the end of the AI run.\n\n\"We keep our overweight to U.S. equities, driven by the AI mega force, and see the selloff presenting buying opportunities,\" BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a research note Monday night.\n\nRecession fears have driven the market lower as investors speculate over whether the Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy too restrictive. BlackRock describes these concerns as \"overdone.\"\n\n\"We think growth will be supportive of risk assets and believe markets are pricing in too many Fed rate cuts,\" the team wrote.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who holds the most bullish year-end S&P 500 target on Wall Street at 6,000, isn't backing down either. In a note to clients on Monday, Emanuel noted that the recent spike in the CBOE Volatility Index(^VIX), provides the opportunity for \"patient buying.\" Quick spikes in volatility, as seen on Monday, usually end with stocks higher a year later, per Emanuel.\n\nHe likens the current moment to the large drawdowns seen in tech stocks during the \"1994-99 Boom bull market.\"\n\n\"The rationale for AI, in a world where the global workforce is aging rapidly and efficiency will be critical to drive productivity enhancements, is greater than ever,\" Emanuel wrote. \"We view the current 'AI Air Pocket' as an opportunity to gain exposure to a long term secular theme.\"\n\nStill, if investors have been staying out of the large tech names because valuations have risen to an uncomfortable level, whether the recent drawdown has done enough to create an attractive buying opportunity is up for debate.\n\nThe equity research team at Goldman Sachs points out that while the basket of large tech stocks, including — Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta (META), Microsoft and Nvidia — is down 13% since July 10, earnings estimates have been moving higher. Since June 30, 2025 earnings estimates for all of those companies except Microsoft have risen.\n\nThis has brought a contraction of valuation multiples for the group of tech stocks, but they still trade slightly higher than the 10-year median average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The mega-cap tech stocks have dropped sharply, but their valuations continue to reflect AI optimism despite investor concerns about the likely timing,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Monday night.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) are up big since the start of 2023. But all three megacap growth stocks have sold off in recent months and are now down over 10% from their all-time highs.\n\nWhen great companies go on sale, it can be challenging to decide which one to buy. And you may not want to sell out of a stock you like to buy another one.\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a way to invest in multiple companies in an amount you are comfortable with and for a low fee. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: MGK) has sizable holdings in Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and other top growth stocks.\n\nHere's why all three stocks are great buys now and what makes the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF one of the simplest and most effective ways to invest in all three companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is growing into its valuation\n\nNvidia may be down around 20% from its all-time high set earlier this summer. But the stock has still more than doubled in 2024 -- which illustrates just how hot it has been.\n\nFortunately for long-term investors, the recent pullback in Nvidia seems mostly due to valuation concerns -- not the core business. Nvidia's stock price is up over 400% in the last three years, but its diluted earnings per share (EPS) are up over 500% -- which has helped keep the valuation (somewhat) reasonable. But that pace of growth is unsustainable.\n\nEven so, analyst consensus estimates call for $2.72 in 2025 earnings per share (EPS) and $3.74 in fiscal 2026 EPS. For context, Nvidia earned $1.19 in fiscal 2024 diluted EPS.\n\nNvidia has come a long way, but it is still valued based on its potential earnings rather than where it is today. The stock could begin to look expensive if there's an unexpected slowdown in demand for its graphics processing units to fuel artificial intelligence (AI) workflows or if competition adds pricing pressure on Nvidia and leads to lower margins.\n\nIt's up to the market to decide what it wants to pay for the stock. But Nvidia stands out as a solid buy until the investment thesis changes. The company retains its dominant market share, and there haven't been any red flags indicating its position is waning.\n\nMicrosoft just reported a banner year\n\nMicrosoft reported its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings last Tuesday. Despite the results being primarily in line with expectations, the stock pulled back as much as 7% after hours. One possible explanation for the knee-jerk reaction is that investors had grown accustomed to Microsoft blowing expectations out of the water.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt times like this, it's better to look at the actual results of the business instead of using its stock price as a yardstick. And Microsoft's results have been nothing short of impeccable.\n\nMetric 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Revenue (in billions) $245.12 $211.92 $198.27 $168.09 $143.01 Operating margin 45% 42% 42% 42% 37% Diluted EPS $11.80 $9.68 $9.65 $8.05 $5.76\n\nData source: Microsoft. All data based on Microsoft's fiscal year, which ends June 30.\n\nEarnings have doubled in five years, outpacing revenue growth and leading to higher margins. Microsoft has turned into a cash cow and has a sizable capital return program, including significant stock repurchases and the largest dividend expense of any U.S.-based company.\n\nMicrosoft is a complete company that is deserving of its premium valuation. The company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35 compared to 28.4 for the S&P 500 index.\n\nMeta Platforms is a great value\n\nUnlike Nvidia and Microsoft, which have P/E ratios above the S&P 500's, Meta Platforms trades at a discount to the benchmark. It also has the highest free cash flow (FCF) yield out of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a group of tech-focused companies that includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. META Free Cash Flow Yield Chart\n\nFCF yield is a useful metric for determining how much FCF a business is generating based on its value. The formula is simply FCF divided by market cap or FCF per share divided by the stock price.\n\nMeta's 4% FCF yield illustrates just how much of a cash cow its business is. It means the company could be paying a 4% dividend yield -- fully supported by FCF. But since Meta only recently began paying a dividend and the yield is just 0.4% -- a better way of looking at FCF yield is the amount of extra cash the company has to repurchase stock or reinvest in the business. In this case, it's tens of billions of dollars per year.\n\nMeta has been doing a phenomenal job leveraging AI across its apps to boost user engagement and advertising effectiveness. Meta is a great buy for investors who believe in the company's ability to continue monetizing Instagram while growing its user base and engagement.\n\nUsing ETFs to invest in growth stocks\n\nWhether regularly contributing savings to a portfolio or managing what we already have, we all have a limited amount of capital to deploy into the stock market. There are always plenty of good stocks to buy; the question is which ones to buy and how much to allocate to each.\n\nThe Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF invests in 71 different growth stocks -- including a whopping 57.5% in the Magnificent Seven. More specifically, 30% of the fund is in Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. This top-heavy concentration provides meaningful exposure to each stock while also maintaining diversification across different end markets.\n\nAnother advantage of the ETF is that the minimum investment is just $1, and the expense ratio is .07% -- or just 7 cents for every $100 invested. Buying one full share of Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia costs over $900 -- which may be inconvenient if your portfolio inflows are smaller. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF provides a way to maintain diversification no matter the portfolio size -- which is an advantage if you are looking to dip your toes into megacap growth stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Intel Is Forced To Take Bolder Action To Make Its Turnaround Happen",
        "content": "Intel Is Forced To Take Bolder Action To Make Its Turnaround Happen\n\nOn Thursday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) delivered a few bad news with its second quarter earnings. Missing analyst estimates across the board, Intel also provided a weak guidance as second-half of the year seems to be more challenging than previously expected. Intel’s disappointing report brought down other chip stock, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML).\n\nA Disappointing Second Quarter Performance\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 29th, Intel reported its revenue dropped about 1% YoY to $12.8 billion, below LSEG’s consensus estimate of $12.94 billion.\n\nWhat’s even worse is the unexpectedly large net loss of $1.61 billion, down from last year’s comparable quarter when Intel reported a net income of  $1.48 billion. Adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share were a far cry from 10 cents that LSEG analysts expected.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger admitted that the second quarter financials were disspointing, despite Intel having achieved key product and process technology milestones. CFO David Zinsner acknowledged that the dissapointing performance is partly owed to the decision to ramp AI PC chip offerings, more precisley Core Ultra PC chips, that hurt the bottom line. Also, rivals like AMD have been actively working to take Intel’s market share.\n\nA Dissapointing Guidance\n\nFor the third quarter, Intel guided for a bigger revenue decline. With the revenue outlook in the range between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, even the high end of the range falls below LSEG’s estimated guidance of around $14.35 billion. Moreover, Intel guided for an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share.\n\nFocus on a multiyear transformation strategy that requires bolder actions.\n\nIntel’s turnaound revoles around lowering capital expenditures, cost of sales and operating costs, while maintaining core investment to support its supply chains. But to take costs under control, Intel will be undertaing drastic actions on its turnaround journey. Over the next few years, the semiconductor giant  plans to reduce its head count by more than 15%  which translates to about 15,000 jobs, while also suspending its dividend until cash flow improves.However, Gelsinger, remains confident that these actions, along with next year’s launch of Intel 18A  will empower Intel to regain process technology leadership, along with improving its market positioning and profitability.While the PC market has begun to recover after the post-pandemic plunge, its been a rather sluggish rebound. Intel is ambitiously trying to catch up on not only but two fronts, as it aims to increase its competitiveness against Nvidia and AMD on the fabless design front while also taking on TSMC as a foundry. But long gone are the days of Intel’s domination and with costs being too high and margins too low, it will need to take drastic action for its rebound to even become a possibility.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 High-Growth Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "High-growth cloud computing stocks have been all the rage in recent years, with pure-play cloud companies posting jaw-dropping growth numbers. However, the recent selloff we’re seeing in certain tech segments, and the global pressure that’s been building for equity markets, are providing a harsh reality check for investors.\n\nMany cloud stocks are currently trading at significant discounts to fair value. Thus, despite the bearish sentiment surrounding the tech sector, I believe it’s worth selectively buying some of these dips.\n\nOf course, I don’t think you should rush to pour money into these stocks just yet. A more prudent approach is to start buying incrementally, and continue to buy as the selloff potentially deepens. This strategy could lead to substantial gains in the long run. Here are three such high-growth cloud stocks to consider adding at these lower levels right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cloud-based cybersecurity solutions to protect organizations against cyber threats. The company has faced significant challenges in recent weeks following a software bug that caused widespread IT outages. That bug has shaken investor confidence and caused CRWD stock to plummet nearly 40% in July alone.\n\nDespite the setback, some analysts remain optimistic about CrowdStrike’s long-term prospects. Wells Fargo’s (NYSE:WFC) Andrew Nowinski maintained an overweight rating on July 22, albeit with a reduced price target of $350. However, others like Piper Sandler’s Rob Owens are more cautious, maintaining a neutral rating with a $310 target amid increased uncertainty.\n\nCrowdStrike’s Q1 2025 earnings were impressive, with record net new annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth of 22% year-over-year and ending ARR hitting $3.65 billion. The company also boasts a strong balance sheet with $3.7 billion in cash. However, the looming threat of lawsuits from impacted customers like Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which estimates $500 million in losses from the outage, could put a dent in those coffers.\n\nWhile CrowdStrike is undoubtedly one of the hardest-hit tech stocks in recent weeks, I think investing at these “cheap” prices (cheap for a cloud cybersecurity company, that is) could be a good idea for long-term investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility.\n\nOf course, with the ongoing global selloff, there’s always the risk of further downside. But if you’re looking to scoop up a high-growth tech company at a discount and hold it for years, CRWD stock is definitely worth considering right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nNutanix (NTNX) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. cheap cloud stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) provides cloud computing software that enables companies to manage hybrid cloud and multi-cloud deployments. The company reported solid Q3 fiscal 2024 results, with revenue growing 17% year-over-year to $525 million and ARR increasing 24% to $1.82 billion.\n\nWhile Nutanix stock is still up 57% over the past year, shares have pulled back around 35% from their highs. I believe this level presents an attractive entry point for this high-growth cloud play. At 39-times forward earnings, the stock’s valuation isn’t cheap but looks reasonable, given Nutanix’s strong growth profile. The forward sales multiple of 5.4-times also compares favorably to other fast-growing cloud stocks.\n\nOn the company’s Q3 earnings call, Nutanix’s management team highlighted increasing interest from large enterprise customers, although sales cycles are elongating for these bigger deals. If Nutanix can continue converting its expanding pipeline of big customers, the stock looks poised for more upside from here.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) provides cloud networking solutions for data centers and campuses. The company recently reported strong Q2 2024 results, with revenue up 15.9% year-over-year to $1.69 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.10, beating estimates by 16 cents. Analysts seem bullish on ANET stock following the report, with some increasing their earnings estimates. Indeed, this has been one of the top-performing tech stocks in recent years, with ANET stock soaring 458% over the past five years alone.\n\nThis stock has pulled back about 13% from its highs as of writing, which could provide a buying opportunity for those who believe the broader market will hold up okay. However, I wouldn’t overcommit to loading up on this stock all at once. A smarter approach may be to dollar-cost average into any further tech weakness and position for long-term gains, as Arista’s underlying business remains robust.\n\nThe company is collaborating with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on AI networking, and analysts expect Arista to benefit significantly from customer AI infrastructure investments by 2025. I think this is a stock that’s starting to look interesting, and could look even better on further weakness moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Qualcomm Stock Price Prediction: Why You Should Buy the QCOM Dip",
        "content": "As you likely know, AI stocks have been pulling back in recent weeks. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is no exception. During this time frame, Qualcomm stock has fallen by around 20%, from around $200 to around $160 per share.\n\nWith broad sentiment for the AI growth trend shifting to bearish, not even the release of solid quarterly results has been enough to fight the trend.\n\nWorse yet, with this reversal, Qualcomm skeptics are coming out of the woodwork. Once again, they are laying out the bear case for this mobile-focused chip company that’s trying to become an “AI contender.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, does that mean it’s time to pack it in with QCOM? Not quite. The pessimists do make a few valid points about certain risks with Qualcomm.\n\nHowever, in my view, the AI-driven bull case remains intact. As such, a “buy the dip” opportunity may be emerging. All it requires to seize it is a strong stomach and a little patience.\n\nQualcomm Stock: The Bear Case Re-Emerges\n\nOn July 31, Qualcomm released its results for the quarter ending June 23, 2024. For the quarter, the company reported year-over-year revenue growth 11%, and earnings growth of 18%.\n\nYet while both figures came in slightly above forecasts, again this wasn’t enough to make investors excited again.\n\nRather, the market used a lack of a strong earnings beat as an excuse to bail on Qualcomm stock on the first full trading day after earnings.\n\nIt also didn’t help that the tech stock sell-off intensified that same day. Also, several analysts have voiced their concerns about the degree in which AI-related smartphone chip growth boosts results in the coming quarters.\n\nWith this, the bear case has come back into vogue. In a nutshell, the bears believe that underwhelming mobile chip sales growth will outweigh other positives.\n\nNamely, potential growth from Qualcomm’s rollout of its Snapdragon X system-on-a-chip platform for AI-PCs.\n\nAdmittedly, this makes sense. Despite management’s touting of this product line, Qualcomm has yet to come out with any initial sales numbers.\n\nNevertheless, there may be a silver lining to the current downbeat stance held by analysts and investors. It all has to do with QCOM’s current valuation.\n\nA Low Valuation Means Big Payoff Potential\n\nEven during the height of “AI mania,” investors priced Qualcomm stock at a discount to other high-profile AI chip plays.\n\nAfter the latest sell-off, a high valuation gap between QCOM and names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains.\n\nQCOM trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple in the midteens, whereas AMD and NVDA both trade for around 39 times forward earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, while the market believes this massive valuation discount is warranted today, that may not be the case a few quarters from now.\n\nAs BofA’s Tal Liani, an analyst far more upbeat on Qualcomm, argued after earnings, there may be a path for subsequent results to exceed expectations.\n\nTo back up this argument, Liani cited several factors. They include a rebound in premium smartphone sales, better-than-expected success with AI-PC chips, and the potential for the company to ink favorable licensing deals.\n\nEven if all of this results in Qualcomm simply meeting expectations for the coming fiscal year ending September 2025, this could mean a big surge for shares. How? Through a combination of shares rising on improved results, plus a rerating to the upside.\n\n$225 by 2025? It’s Possible, So Buy the QCOM Dip\n\nBased on current sell-side consensus, Qualcomm earnings could hit $11.21 per share next fiscal year. Meeting these expectations, plus finally putting to bed notions that Qualcomm is an “AI dud,” could lead to multiple expansion for shares.\n\nFor instance, if investors rerate QCOM to a forward multiple of 20, this would represent a surge to $225 per share. That’s over 41% above current price levels.\n\nA move to between 25 and 30 times forward earnings, while perhaps more of a tall order, could send Qualcomm up to prices more than double that of current levels.\n\nWeighing this against the chances that this already-discounted chip stock experiences further multiple compression, it’s clear that risk/reward is well within your favor, no matter what the naysayers say.\n\nOnce again, keep in mind that weakness may continue in the months ahead, but if you’re willing to wait, and can stomach the volatility, you may want to consider buying the dip with Qualcomm stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in August",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the hottest technology trends and is just getting started. The largest tech companies in the world are spending billions of dollars to create new products and services, all while trying to stay on top.\n\nBut just like with any other investing trend, it's essential to weed out the companies that are merely following the hype to find the ones that are actually leading the way. Here are three AI stocks that are hands-down AI leaders that are buys right now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) justifiably gets a lot of attention in the AI world. The company was an early leader in artificial intelligence when it began selling graphics processing units (GPUs) to large tech companies for AI processing.\n\nFast forward a few years, and Nvidia is still leading the AI charge. It holds an estimated 70% to 95% of the AI chip market and continues to add new products, like its latest H200 chip, to spur new demand. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's latest earnings call that demand for the H200 had already surpassed supply.\n\nTech companies, racing to create the best AI products and services, will continue to upgrade their data centers in the coming years, likely fueling more sales of Nvidia's chips. Huang believes tech companies around the world will spend more than $1 trillion over the next five years investing in AI and doubling the number of data centers.\n\nWith demand already outpacing supply for Nvidia's H200 and H100 chips, companies literally can't get enough of the company's processors. Nvidia's stock is by no means cheap, but a greater than 10% decline in its share price over the past month is opening up a buying opportunity for investors looking for a long-term AI play.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) is another leading semiconductor company powering the AI revolution. Its much-larger-rival Nvidia gets most of the attention, but there's plenty to like about AMD's AI opportunity, and the company proved it in its most recent quarter.\n\nAMD reported second-quarter results (which ended June 29), and its data center sales, including its AI chip sales, more than doubled. Data center revenue rose 115% from the year-ago quarter to $2.8 billion, led by demand for its Instinct GPUs.\n\nThe massive jump in data center sales meant that the segment accounted for nearly half of AMD's revenue in the quarter. And there's likely more on the way.\n\nAMD's management said on its earnings call that the \"overwhelmingly positive\" demand for its AI chips caused the company to raise 2024 data center guidance to $4.5 billion, up from the previous guidance of $4 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith AMD's stock underperforming its AI peers lately, investors have a nice buying opportunity. AMD shares are down about 10% this year, but the pullback may not last long considering AMD's recent data center growth.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nCompanies that design AI semiconductors and develop AI software often receive the most attention, but there's another AI angle you might be overlooking: chip manufacturers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), or TSM, makes the semiconductors that Nvidia and others design, and its scale is nearly unmatched. The company manufactures about 90% of the world's most advanced chips, and production demand is on the rise.\n\nTSM's sales increased 32.8% in the second quarter (which ended on June 30), and earnings per American depositary receipt were $1.48, outpacing Wall Street's consensus estimate of $1.41. The impressive results were driven by AI chip demand, and TSM's management expects both AI and smartphone semiconductor manufacturing to increase in the third quarter.\n\n\"Moving into third quarter 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" Taiwan Semiconductor CFO Wendell Huang said in a statement.\n\nDespite the company's opportunities, investors have been a little nervous about TSM lately. There are some risks of geopolitical uncertainty, particularly if China invades Taiwan in the future.\n\nWhile that's definitely a concern, the recent pullback on TSM's stock price has also given investors an opening. Over the past month, the company's shares are down about 9%, allowing investors to buy Taiwan Semiconductor's stock at a slight discount.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

In fact, the U.S. and Germany have agreed to work together on the quantum computer projects coming in the future. But we are still very early in this game.\n\nSo, which quantum computing stocks have good potential in the long-term? For some, “long-term” means boring but it’s very exciting to me. It means an opportunity to ride a proven concept from a very early stage. This means more reliable long-term profits if things pan out.\n\nIn this article, I’ll identify three “boring” quantum computing stocks that could make investors very happy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of maybe three companies that seems to run everything online. YouTube has 4.9 billion active users, and Google has roughly 92% of the search industry all to itself.\n\nWith this market share head start, GOOG already established itself as a big player in quantum computing. Using quantum technology, Alphabet collaborates with JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) for financial service optimization, Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) for aerospace, and Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) for automotive improvements.\n\nIn 2019, New Scientist announced Google had reached quantum supremacy. But in July 2024, new qubit computers smashed that record by a factor of 100, using 30,000 times less power.\n\nGOOG’s quantum computing plans include heavy research and development into qubits. This includes qubit teleportation using the 70-qubit quantum devices.\n\nAdditionally, the Xprize Foundation and the GESDA are collaborating with GOOG, holding a $5 million contest to accelerate quantum computations that addresses global challenges.\n\nWith major projects and heavy investment, expect GOOG to use its market share to grow alongside quantum computing in the coming years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the second most valuable company in the world after $3 trillion of growth. They posted record revenue of $26 billion which was up 262% from a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nA lot of the revenue they’re generating is based on their cloud services and a lot of other things that they do. So they’re not pigeon-holed as a chip manufacturer.\n\nWhen you start looking at AI oriented processors, Nvidia is making waves in the quantum computing field, establishing their reputation in the industry, including the use of its open-source Cuda-Q platform.\n\nNvidia has sped up the work of quantum computing and the number of national supercomputer centers in the world. This includes Germany, Japan, and Poland, where they are making supercomputers. The expectation is that these countries are where quantum computing will come into phase.\n\nNvidia worked with Rolls-Royce and Classiq to make a quantum computing breakthrough that helps jet engines be designed and run more efficiently.\n\nFormFactor (FORM) A concept image showing a quantum computer with a matrix background; quantum computing. leading quantum stocks, Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM) is much less known than Alphabet or Nvidia, but deeply immersed in quantum computing. FORM is a quantitative engineering company with a variety of cryogenic tests and measurement options.\n\nThey paired up with Tabor Electronics to develop the Echo 5Q integrated 5 qubit quantum computer. So they have the quantum computers already built, developed, and they’re already using it.\n\nThe program gives scientists and engineers high quality physical qubits for research and development. This means there will be a lot more breakthroughs ahead.\n\nIn Q1 2024, FORM reported $168 million which was up slightly over the previous quarter. More impressively, the Q1 net income was $21.8 million or 28 cents per share, beating the $1.3 million last year. So being at almost at $22 million this year is a huge growth.\n\nIn Aug. 2024, FORM took a massive drop in price. Caution is recommended when looking for an entry point. Make sure the dust has settled; don’t try to catch a falling knife. Remember these are long-term plays.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sam Farnham did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Rate Cuts Incoming? These 7 Stocks Could Skyrocket",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is telegraphing a possible September rate cut that will supercharge the stock market. If inflation continues to fall, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that “a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table” when the committee next reconvenes in mid-September, leading to the formation of some good stocks for rate cuts.\n\nIf the Fed does cut rates it will prompt the first decrease in lending rates in four years. Lowered borrowing costs will prompt increases in economic activity at all levels. Businesses will have access to cheaper capital that will prompt borrowing to stimulate growth which in turn drives the economy higher in aggregate. Consumers will respond similarly to lower rates. That should stimulate spending across all sectors, sending shares higher.\n\nThat isn’t to say the effects will be felt equally across all sectors of the market. Certain shares tend to fare better in a rate-cut environment. Tech, financial, and consumer discretionary shares tend to perform better for a multitude of reasons. Let’s look at some of those shares which are set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a well-respected real estate income trust (REIT) stock that is truly worth buying. Generally speaking, REITs focused on commercial property and the residential sector do particularly well as rates fall: Rate cuts alleviate substantial pressure in those firms. Realty Income is a commercial REIT that rents commercial properties to industry-leading firms on a long-term basis.\n\nSo, it already enjoys strong performance due to its ability to contract with high-performing firms. Realty Income also operates those contracts under the net lease structure. That means most expenses associated with its properties fall on the lessee and not Realty Income.\n\nREITs like Realty Income have gone largely underappreciated for the past few years as high bond yields have made their dividend income less attractive. That has shifted more recently as bond yields correct. Realty Income should strengthen even more as September approaches and the positive effects of rate cuts become more apparent to potential O investors. None of that even considers the monthly dividend paid by Realty Income. Reinvestment periods are more frequent and that is but one more reason to consider O stock currently.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is sort of an obvious pick among stocks set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts. Tech stocks are generally seen as strong investments as borrowing costs fall. They tend to rely heavily on financing to expand and cheaper lending makes those investments more attractive overall. Amazon, as one of the best tech stocks, benefits as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon currently has more than $135 billion in debt. That debt has an effective interest rate of 1.91% and results in a quarterly interest payment of $2.576 billion. Amazon, like everyone else, benefits from the ability to lower that payment as rates fall.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has more than $85 billion in cash on hand currently. It could find a way to pay off its debt if management decided it was a pertinent strategy. Earnings are expected to grow by approximately 30% on average over the next few years so Amazon’s debt is not a problem. Regardless, it will become more manageable as soon as rate cuts occur.\n\nAmazon will also benefit from a surge in discretionary spending that usually occurs when rates fall. Consumer confidence rises and retailers including Amazon benefit.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going through a patch of trouble that isn’t necessarily reflected in its current stock price. Profit margins are as bad as they’ve been in 5 years and the company continues to cut prices which will only exacerbate its issues. Why then should investors consider TSLA shares?\n\nWell, for one, Tesla is well-positioned to benefit from upcoming rate cuts. As my colleague Larry Ramer noted, Tesla heavily subsidizes the loans used to purchase its vehicles. As rates fall those loans will perform better, improving the bottom line.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that vehicle purchases generally rise in a falling rate environment. Consumers, bolstered by lower lending rates, tend to go out and purchase vehicles more often.\n\nBeyond that, R&D investments also become cheaper. Tesla continues to develop its humanoid robot known as Optimus. Elon Musk is very optimistic about its potential effects on the company and suggests that it could make Tesla a $25 trillion dollar company in the future. However, it has not yet met expectations which is very typical of Tesla projects overall. Anyway, lower rates will cheapen lending used to further research and develop Optimus which is another reason to consider Tesla at the moment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be one of the biggest stories in the stock market today. Its recent decline from $130 to adjust above $100, has irked investors.\n\nPundits had worried that the shares would fall below $100 but at the time of writing, that doesn’t look to be the case. Instead, Nvidia shares jumped by nearly 13% in the 24 hours before this article was written. That sent prices above $117 reinstalling confidence in the AI infrastructure hardware narrative.\n\nNvidia is also a beneficiary of incoming rate cuts for the simple fact that AI spending should increase as rates fall. It’s logical to assume that AI hyperscalers will be upping their investment in Nvidia chips as a result of rate cuts.\n\nNvidia’s revenues are expected to double between this year and 2027. So, even though Nvidia has been volatile this year overall growth is nowhere near over. The growth and return on AI stocks is likely to come in stages. Those stages will not be even but Nvidia will continue to be the best AI hardware play nonetheless among stocks for rate cuts.\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinancial stocks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) generally perform well during rate cuts. JPMorgan Chase is a massive lending center after all: It benefits from a rush of demand as lower rates prompt businesses to invest and drive lending higher.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is the largest U.S. bank and the 5th largest globally as measured by assets. It’s also highly aligned with the business sector and should see greater lending demand than rivals like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) which are more consumer-oriented.\n\nThe company isn’t necessarily a stronger performer overall. But recent consolidation has made it a bigger behemoth and that matters. Investors will be looking to the financial sector and banks in particular as rate cuts occur. JPM shares will be top of mind for the sheer scale of the firm. As a result, it should appreciate in price. Don’t be surprised if share prices continue to rise after an already strong first half in 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is poised to continue its strong performance following rate cuts. 2024 has not been easy for the iPhone seller and tech giant. Most of its 20% returns this year occurred following its AI announcements in June. It continues to deal with the effects of inflation and high rates of discretionary spending for high-priced items including the iPhone. Those effects have been felt globally, particularly in China where sales have slumped dramatically.\n\nDiscretionary spending increases as rates fall. That implies that Apple’s flagging iPhone sales will benefit dramatically if rates fall.\n\nInvestors continue to wonder when high AI capital expenditures will pay off for the tech giants. Apple. Those expenditures have served as a drag on prices of late. AMD’s strong earnings suggest that a clear answer in either direction will take time to emerge and that recent concerns about mega firms are overblown.\n\nApple should benefit significantly from the application of AI to iPhones and the concurrent drop in rates that should prompt increased discretionary spending and boost stocks for rate cuts like AAPL.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has historically performed well as rates come down. The stock performs well for a simple reason: people tend to take out home improvement loans at higher rates as interest rates fall.\n\nNow is arguably a good time to establish a position in Home Depot given that it trades below consensus target prices. Some investors would argue that Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) makes a better trade given its lower valuation. However, Home Depot has always traded at a richer valuation than Lowe’s. It is the dominant home improvement company and with that comes higher prices.\n\nFurthermore, Home Depot is enacting a $500 million cost-cutting initiative which should result in stronger earnings. In turn, that should help to justify HD stock’s richer valuation relative to its main competitor.\n\nIn short, there is a blend of macroeconomic and internal factors at play which should catalyze Home Depot stock to move higher in anticipation of incoming great cuts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "The explosive growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market drove many tech stocks to record highs over the past few years. Two of those most obvious plays on that secular trend were Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the world's largest supplier of AI accelerator chips, and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), which owns a big stake in OpenAI.\n\nNvidia and Microsoft are still the sector's bellwethers, but investors shouldn't overlook the other hidden gems. Let's check out three of those promising plays: AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), SentinelOne (NYSE: S), and Innodata(NASDAQ: INOD). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. AMD\n\nAMD, the world's second-largest producer of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs, doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia as an AI chipmaker. But over the past few years, AMD ramped up its production of Instinct GPUs for data centers.\n\nIts newest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 5nm and 6nm nodes, offer comparable performance to Nvidia's H100 GPUs for a fraction of the price. That lower price tag makes it a compelling alternative for data center customers that are struggling with Nvidia's high prices and supply constraints.\n\nAMD's data center chip sales (which include its Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs) only rose 7% in 2023, but surged 80% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 and soared 115% in the second quarter. Its data center chip sales accounted for 48% of its revenue in the second quarter -- up from just 24% a year earlier.\n\nThat rapid expansion, which mirrors the breakneck growth of Nvidia's data center business, offset its slower sales of PC gaming GPUs, gaming console APUs, and embedded chips. It also complemented its robust sales of Ryzen CPUs for PCs.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect AMD's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 105%. Its stock isn't cheap at 42 times its forward adjusted earnings, but it could soar a lot higher as its data center business expands and becomes a much larger percentage of its business.\n\n2. SentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne is a cybersecurity company that aims to replace all human analysts with AI-powered algorithms on its Singularity extended detection and response (XDR) platform. It provides its services through a mix of on-site appliances and cloud-based services.\n\nSentinelOne's revenue more than doubled in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 (which ended in January 2023), but only grew 47% in fiscal 2024. It expects that slowdown, which it attributes to the tough macro headwinds, to continue with 29% to 31% growth in fiscal 2025. That deceleration -- along with its lack of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP (adjusted) profits -- drove away the bulls as interest rates rose. Its stock now trades 34% below its IPO price and 70% below its all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut after that decline, SentinelOne's stock looks historically cheap at less than 9 times this year's sales. Analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as it expands its AI-powered niche of the cybersecurity sector. They also expect it to narrow its net losses as economies of scale kick in.\n\nCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), the cloud-native cybersecurity leader that competes against SentinelOne in the XDR market, notably recently found itself blamed for a global IT outage on Windows machines with a flawed software update. That massive blunder could drive more companies to SentinelOne and other AI-powered cybersecurity platforms.\n\n3. Innodata\n\nInnodata went public back in 1993, and it was considered a slow-growth IT services and enterprise software provider over the next 25 years. But from 2019 to 2023, Innodata's revenue rose at a CAGR of 12%, and analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 33% from 2023 to 2026. It expects \"at least\" 40% organic revenue growth in 2024.\n\nThis dusty old company -- which provides business process, technology, and consulting services along with its digital information management software -- became an exciting growth stock again as it rolled out new generative AI services. By the beginning of 2024, it had signed master service agreements with five of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies. It expects to significantly grow its revenue from three of those tech giants this year.\n\nInnodata racked up GAAP losses over the past three years, but its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned positive in 2023 -- and analysts expect that figure to grow at a three-year CAGR of 64% through 2026. Innodata's stock has already rallied 1,450% over the past five years as it became a growth play again, but it still doesn't look too expensive at 5 times this year's sales. Therefore, this oft-overlooked tech stock could still have plenty of room to run as the generative AI market expands.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Dumping It in Favor of These 3 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Since the start of 2023, no trend has been hotter on Wall Street than the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee or undertake assigned tasks. The seemingly limitless ceiling attached to the AI revolution traces back to the ability of software and systems to learn without human intervention and evolve over time. The capacity to become more proficient at tasks, or perhaps learn new skills entirely, gives this technology utility in almost every sector and industry of the global economy. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlthough AI is rivaling the internet in terms of game-changing potential for corporate America, optimism isn't universal among Wall Street's brightest (and richest) investors.\n\nBased on Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from the March-ended quarter -- a 13F allows investors to see what top money managers have been buying and selling -- more than a half-dozen prominent billionaires were sellers of Wall Street's AI darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these select billionaire investors were piling into three other hypergrowth AI stocks.\n\nEight billionaire investors meaningfully pared down their stakes in Nvidia\n\nIn short order, Nvidia has become the go-to supplier of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) used in enterprise data centers. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights estimate that Nvidia was responsible for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped to enterprise data centers in 2023.\n\nBut despite having a monopoly on the hardware powering split-second decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers, eight billionaire money managers -- nine, if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- were sellers of Nvidia stock during the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (4,415,510 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (4,208,010 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,480,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (3,045,050 shares)\n\nWhile profit-taking might explain some of this selling, history is a potentially bigger concern. All eight of these billionaires have watched for decades as next-big-thing innovations were highly touted, but ultimately failed to deliver early in their existence. Investors have a tendency to overestimate how quickly a new technology will be adopted by consumers and businesses. If this trend persists, it's a matter of when, not if, the AI bubble bursts.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive pressures are going to begin weighing on Nvidia, too. Even if it holds onto its compute advantage, which appears likely with the rollout of its next-generation GPU platform (known as Blackwell) on deck, Nvidia's inability to meet all enterprise demand opens the door for cheaper alternatives to thrive.\n\nI'll also quickly mention that Nvidia's four biggest customers by net sales are developing AI chips of their own. Even if this is just complementary hardware, it's reducing data center \"real estate\" for Wall Street's AI darling.\n\nBut while these billionaires were actively selling shares of Nvidia during the March-ended quarter, some were piling into three supercharged AI stocks instead. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nThe first high-octane AI stock that select billionaire investors were busy buying as they were paring down their stakes in Nvidia is data-mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Altogether, five Nvidia sellers were Palantir stock buyers, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (3,216,525 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,368,832 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (769,965 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (481,634 shares)\n\nThe primary draw for investors to Palantir is that its services are unique at scale. While other companies may offer bits and pieces of the services Palantir provides, no large companies are anywhere close to matching its scope of services. Having a moat and being unique are traits that Wall Street and investors tend to reward with a hearty valuation premium.\n\nFor years, the company's AI-driven Gotham platform has been responsible for much of its growth. Gotham caters to government entities and helps with everything from data collection to mission planning. This segment typically lands multiyear contracts, which is what leads to predictable and somewhat sustainable double-digit growth.\n\nHowever, Gotham has a natural ceiling. This is to say that Palantir isn't going to allow certain governments to use its platform (e.g., China and Russia). Thus, Palantir Technologies' long-term growth opportunity lies with its rapidly growing, but still rough around the edges, Foundry platform.\n\nFoundry is a business-focused platform incorporating AI, machine learning, and optimization models that help businesses make sense of copious amounts of data in order to streamline their operations. Sustained double-digit sales growth should be relatively easy for Foundry throughout the decade.\n\nAmazon\n\nA second hypergrowth AI stock top-notch billionaires were active buyers of in the first quarter is e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Two of Nvidia's biggest sellers were some of Amazon's prominent buyers (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its globally leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates minimal operating income and razor-thin margins for the company. What attracts billionaires like Englander and Laffont to Amazon is its considerably faster-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nCloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, unquestionably, the most important puzzle piece. As of the end of 2023, AWS held almost a third of global cloud infrastructure service market share, which is an enviable position to be in considering that enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early stages of ramping up. Amazon is looking to incorporate generative AI solutions within AWS to gives its customers the ability to handle a variety of tasks, ranging from text summarization to image generation.\n\nWhile AWS has, traditionally, accounted for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, subscription services (e.g., Prime) and advertising services are generating sustained double-digit growth, as well. In particular, it's been more than two years since Amazon's advertising services segment delivered less than 20% year-over-year sales growth. This is the advantage of luring more than 3 billion visits to its site each month.\n\nFollowing a post-earnings release sell-off, shares of Amazon are historically cheap, relative to Wall Street's consensus cash flow estimates for the company in 2025.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings\n\nThe third supercharged artificial intelligence stock successful billionaire investors were purchasing as they were sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block is cybersecurity goliath CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD). The four billionaires that were making this swap include (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (706,283 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (297,097 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (154,688 shares)\n\nWith hindsight being 20/20, selling Nvidia to buy CrowdStrike isn't looking all too smart at the moment. CrowdStrike is reeling from the repercussions of a cybersecurity update it released three weeks ago, which shut down various networks for airlines, financial firms, and tech companies. Though this issue had nothing to do with a cyberattack, CrowdStrike might face a laundry list of litigation in the months to come as businesses hurt by the outage seek damages.\n\nWhat makes this situation so interesting is that, up to this point, CrowdStrike's cloud-native, AI-driven Falcon security platform has been superior to its peers. Falcon oversees trillions of events each week, and has used each of these events to grow smarter and more effective at spotting and responding to potential end-user threats.\n\nEven though CrowdStrike's security platforms are far from the cheapest, its consistent gross retention of around 98% suggests businesses are willing to pay a premium for its services.\n\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike has had success getting its existing clients to add on new services. Just shy of two-thirds of its clients had adopted five or more cloud-modules as of the end of the fiscal first quarter (April 30, 2024).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): Options Traders Are Taking the Contrarian Bet",
        "content": "Wall Street analysts are almost unanimous in their view that semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) will rocket higher. However, options traders apparently have a different take, placing contrarian wagers against NVDA stock. The situation has now become a matter of which narrative investors trust more. In my opinion, the market is the ultimate arbiter, and it’s not giving the warm and fuzzies over the tech juggernaut. Therefore, I am bearish on NVDA.\n\nPessimistic NVDA Stock Wagers Go Against the Tide\n\nTo be sure, it’s not surprising that some options traders have flipped sides regarding the sentiment battle over NVDA stock. Last week, the tech company – which manufactures the advanced graphics processors that make artificial intelligence what it is today – incurred a fall of 5.1%. This Monday, it was down another 6.4%.\n\nStill, the overall narrative seems bullish on NVDA stock. According to a Bloomberg report, the generative AI ecosystem could become a $1.3 trillion economy by 2032. That implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% over the next 10 years, per the article. If so, that’s an excellent reason to consider riding out the volatility in Nvidia.\n\nFurther, multiple experts – such as analysts from Piper Sandler and other institutions – have pounded the table on NVDA stock. Despite the stock’s fall, the red ink could turn out to be an opportunity. However, that’s not what options traders are signaling.\n\nOn Friday, options flow data for Nvidia stock – a screener that focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional or professional investors – revealed that net trade sentiment slipped to negative $5.55 million, thus favoring the bears.\n\nIn other words, when you tally all the premiums associated with options with bullish sentiment and perform the same exercise for bearish sentiment, the net total is negative. This implies that institutional sentiment has shifted negatively despite the positive stories that we hear about generative AI.\n\nKeep in mind that Friday wasn’t the only time that options flow turned pessimistic. Since at least last Wednesday’s session, traders have been betting against NVDA stock. Notably, TipRanks’ unusual options activity screener for Nvidia also corroborates this assessment.\n\nBetween the July 31 session to August 2, traders placed 32 transactions that were deemed bearish in nature. In contrast, only 18 transactions were deemed bullish. By logical deduction, it’s imprudent to assume that Nvidia will continue marching higher without at least considering the possibility of a correction.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancials Present a Tough Backdrop\n\nRegardless of one’s view on NVDA stock, the consensus is that Nvidia’s upcoming fiscal second-quarter earnings report – scheduled for August 28 – will be especially critical. Most likely, the company won’t just need another beat; rather, it must deliver convincing results combined with encouraging forward guidance. However, that scenario is hardly guaranteed.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns centers on the declining magnitude of the earnings beats. For example, in Q2 of Fiscal 2024, Nvidia posted earnings per share of 27 cents, beating the consensus view of 21 cents. This yielded an earnings surprise of 28.6%. However, in the subsequent three quarters, the earnings surprises landed as follows: 17.6%, 13%, and 8.9%.\n\nEssentially, analysts are getting a bit jaded about Nvidia constantly beating per-share profitability estimates. It needs something truly special to impress the Street. However, a company can only dominate for so long before it requires a breather.\n\nThat’s not a dig against NVDA stock. Both things can be true: Nvidia can be a great long-term investment thanks to its numerous innovations, and it could also be due for a correction.\n\nTo be fair, NVDA stock looks relatively undervalued at the moment. Right now, shares trade hands at 30.9x trailing-year sales. However, given that analysts project current year (Fiscal 2025) sales to hit $120.73 billion, NVDA’s projected sales multiple is roughly 20.5x (assuming the same share count of 24.6 billion).\n\nThat’s closer to NVDA’s five-year average price-to-sales ratio (23x). However, during a corrective cycle, a publicly traded asset could drop far lower before reverting back to the mean. Therefore, it wouldn’t be shocking to see NVDA stock fall back to around $50, where strong horizontal support lies. That would put the sales multiple at around 10.2x. At that point, Nvidia would look extremely enticing on the long side.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, NVDA stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average NVDA stock price target is $144.17, implying 43.5% upside potential.\n\nSee more NVDA analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway: Options Traders Cloud the Immediate Narrative for NVDA Stock\n\nFew experts doubt the long-term narrative of Nvidia and its advanced graphics processors. The question really comes down to the near-term trajectory of NVDA stock. Options traders have been placing bearish wagers against the equity throughout its corrective cycle, suggesting more downside ahead. Further, anything short of a blisteringly robust Q2 earnings print could add to the growing skepticism. Therefore, investors may want to wait on the sidelines until the correction fully fades.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- A recent plunge in TSMC’s stock price, on reports of delays in Nvidia’s advanced artificial intelligence chips, was overdone, Citi analysts said in a note, and that the chipmaker’s outlook remained strong.\n\nTSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) shares tumbled some 15% over the past month, and saw steep losses on Monday after media reports said Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips will be delayed by three months or more due to design flaws.\n\nSuch a scenario presents pressure on TSMC’s earnings, given that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a major client for the contract chipmaker.\n\nBut Citi said that despite delays in Nvidia’s most advanced chips, overall demand for chips from the AI industry still remained positive, and that initial technical issues would be just temporary, given that the technology is new.\n\n“We believe TSMC’s solid earnings growth remains intact. Other than robust AI GPU/accelerator demand, we expect its order momentum from CPU, smartphone SoC based on advanced nodes are also intact,” Citi analysts wrote in a note.\n\nTSMC had clocked stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, and also presented a strong outlook for the year amid robust demand from AI.\n\nBut the firm’s stock price plummeted from record highs over the past month, as it was caught up in widespread selling pressure on the technology sector.\n\nWhile TSMC’s earnings were strong, middling reports from other majors, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), raised doubts over just how much of an earnings boost AI was providing.\n\nBut Citi said the AI-fueled demand outlook for Nvidia, which makes the most advanced chips in the market, remained strong.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSMC stock correction overdone amid reports of Nvidia delays- Citi\n\nFactbox-Over 133,000 Florida customers still without power due to Hurricane Debby\n\nCryptoverse: Trump's bitcoin stockpile plan stirs debate\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Japan's share benchmark soars nearly 11% a day after massive sell-offs that shook Wall Street",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared more than 10% early Tuesday, a day after it set markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. Other markets in Asia appeared to have settled somewhat after the rollercoaster ride that started the week.\n\nThe scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash that swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses,  as fears worsened about a slowing  U.S. economy.\n\nThe Nikkei gained nearly 11% early Tuesday but then fell back, trading 8.7% higher at 34,211.83 as investors bought into bargains after the 12.4% rout of the day before.\n\nOn Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.\n\nThe drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring  last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve  has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates  in hopes of stifling inflation.\n\nProfessional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday.\n\nEven gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.\n\nElsewhere in Asia early Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 1.1% at 16,876.98 and the Kospi jumped 3.5% to 2,526.20. Taiwan's Taiex was up 1.2% and in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.3% higher, to 7,675.90.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite index, largely bypassed by the drama of the day before, was up 0.2% at 2,865.06.\n\nMonday's meltdowns reflected fears that damage to the economy from prolonged high interest rates has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”\n\nOf course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone.\n\nSome of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence  technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits.\n\n“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”\n\nThe only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021.\n\nProfessional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it also led traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world.\n\nTreasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nStill, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nMaking things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market.\n\nBut Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines.\n\nApple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake  in the iPhone maker.\n\nNvidia, the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June.\n\nAnother Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08.\n\nWorries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war  may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots  around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections  could further scramble things.\n\nWall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself.\n\nThe threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy.\n\n“It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy.\n\n“When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.”\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott, Christopher Rugaber and Damian J.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. hit engineering snags in the development of two new advanced chips, slowing the release of some products designed to extend its lead in the market for artificial intelligence computing.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk Paris Spent €1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked? What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\n\nThe delays affected the company’s highly anticipated Blackwell lineup, which Nvidia announced in March, according to people familiar with the situation. A version of the chip — known as an AI accelerator — is being reworked to better work with data center infrastructure designed for an earlier chip, the Hopper H100.\n\nThat’s a relatively small segment of the market, though, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Separately, a product that combines a processor with a graphics chip won’t be available in large numbers as quickly as hoped because of problems with supporting technology, they said.\n\nThe snags — first reported by the Information website — reflect the challenges of speeding up the pace of innovation at Nvidia. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is introducing new chip designs and technology more rapidly, aiming to maintain an edge in AI computing. The company dominates the market for AI accelerators — an advantage that has sent its sales and market valuation soaring over the past two years.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on “rumors” about the recent engineering problems. The company has said it has begun sending out samples of Blackwell to customers broadly, and demand for its Hopper generation remains strong.\n\nBlackwell “production is on track to ramp in the second half,” the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement.\n\nReports about the delays contributed to a 6.4% stock decline for Nvidia on Monday, though a broader tech rout also weighed on the shares. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., meanwhile, gained 1.8% — a sign investors hope it may be able to capitalize on the problems.\n\nNvidia supplies its chips to companies like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google that are spending billions on building data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI services.\n\nWhile the delays may affect the flow of the components, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., analysts have mostly taken the concerns in stride. Given the acceleration of innovation, “bumps will continue to happen,” TD Cowen analyst Matt Ramsay said in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeekslong delays, if they materialize, probably won’t have an impact on Nvidia’s rapid revenue gains or long-term growth, he said. Much will depend, however, on how quickly Nvidia fixes the issues and gets chips to major clients.\n\nIn May, Nvidia’s Huang said that Blackwell had reached full production and would be available to cloud-computing providers later this year. He predicted that demand would continue to exceed supply for both the new lineup and its predecessor.\n\n“We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year,” Huang said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. The company is scheduled to give its next quarterly report Aug. 28.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Retailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Advanced Countries in the World and in this article, we will look at the most advanced country in the world.\n\nGlobal Economy at a Glance\n\nThe global economy has surpassed expectations by exhibiting resilience amidst high inflation. The IMF forecasts the world economy to grow at 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, the same as in 2023. The persistent economic growth is driven by increased government spending, strong consumer spending, and an unanticipated boost to the labor force. The advanced economies are expected to grow at slightly higher rates of 1.7% and 1.8% in 2024 and 2025 respectively. Global inflation is forecasted to decline from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025. Overall, the economy is expected to grow moderately with the US leading as a top performer so far as it has resumed its pre-pandemic growth. This year it is expected to grow by 2.7%, compared to the 1.7% growth of advanced economies. You can also look at the 50 Best Countries in the World.\n\nGlobal Tech Trends\n\nOver the past few years, the global technology landscape has witnessed a significant transformation. The two most dominant trends that emerged in 2023 were generative AI and electrification, according to a report by McKinsey & Company. Generative AI has seen an increase of 700% in Google searches, including a surge in job postings and investment. The rapid advancement in AI is further reflected by the development of large language models (LLMS) which are continuously expanding their capabilities. The innovative use of AI can be a dramatic breakthrough in various industries. For instance, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and ETH Zurich have developed an AI model that is capable of accurately determining the stage of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), one of the most common breast cancer conditions by utilizing low-cost and simple tissue images. This could be a revolutionary step toward early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe other top tech trends, electrification and renewables have shown resilience despite broader economic challenges. Their growth is driven by climate change commitments of countries and energy security issues. With the rising concern about reducing carbon emissions, investments in renewables and electric vehicles have surged over the past few years.\n\nOverall the tech sector saw a decline in the economic environment, reflected by a 30-40% decline in tech equity investments. However, the overall growth trajectory of technological innovation presents a positive outlook. Investors have become more cautious in their investments. Nonetheless, AI benefits from increased investment due to its strong growth prospects. The surge in AI is also evident in the publications and patents related to Artificial Intelligence. The talent landscape of the tech sector has experienced significant layoffs in 2024 facing the highest decline in tech-related job postings. This was offset by the high demand for specialized skills in generative AI and electrification. Read 25 Most Innovative Economies in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Global AI Leader\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as a leader in the fast-growing global technology landscape, especially in the AI space. The company is a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPU), chips that are necessary for advanced computing. In the past two decades, the GPU maker has transformed into one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Its continuous innovation has helped it capture a significant share of the market in high-growth sectors such as AI.\n\nIts dominance in AI hardware is evident by its share of over 80% in the data center GPU market. Its enterprise platform, Nvidia AI Enterprise has tools such as NVIDIA NIM and AI Foundry which help businesses and organizations with the deployment of generative AI at scale. Moreover, AI companies like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta utilizing Nvidia Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips further solidify its stronghold over the AI market. The AI leader stands at the forefront of GPU technology with continuous innovations. Its forthcoming AI factory platform, Blackwell GPU offers up to 4 times faster training and 30x prompter inference than its predecessors.\n\nIn its Q2 2024 investor letter, Patient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy said:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100 (Backwell GPU), which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has recorded strong financial performance over the past decade, with its revenue growing at a compound annual rate of more than 20%. In the first quarter, the company logged a record-high surge of 262% year-over-year in its revenue which amounted to $26 billion. The company also recorded a 392% growth in its earnings which came to $0.61 per share. Ending the quarter with strong free cash flow, the company demonstrated its ability to leverage its position to generate significant financial gains.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is poised to capitalize on various growth opportunities going ahead. The automotive sector is expected to be its biggest enterprise vertical, fueled by a surge in demand for AI in autonomous driving technology. Moreover, the ever-evolving consumer internet sector presents a significant growth avenue as it heavily relies on Nvidia's technology for AI assistants. With generative AI gaining traction as one of the biggest technology trends, the company can expect continued growth opportunities in the consumer internet sector. In the past trailing four quarters, nearly 40% of its data center revenue was driven by inference. Surging inference along with user growth is expected to increase the demand for advanced generative AI technology, positioning NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a market leader.\n\nNow, let's have a look at the 20 most advanced countries in the world. The Most Advanced Country in the World\n\nPhoto by Jacek Dylag on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the most advanced countries in the world, we consulted our piece on the countries that spend the most on research and development and shortlisted the top 30 countries based on absolute R&D spending (estimated by utilizing R&D as a percentage of GDP data 2021). Then, we used their Human Development Index (HDI) scores which measure the overall development of a country across key dimensions like life expectancy, education, and per capita income. We then assigned 70% and 30% scores to both our R&D spending and HDI ranks and calculated an average for each country. Finally, we listed the countries in descending order of the composite ranking.\n\nNote: We have excluded Israel from our list despite high R&D spending due to the ongoing war in the Middle East obstructing economic development and advancement.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe Most Advanced Country in the World\n\n1. Germany\n\nAbsolute R&D Spending: $134.45 billion\n\nHuman Development Index: 0.950\n\nComposite Ranking: 4.6\n\nGermany is the most advanced country in the world. In 2021, it spent an estimated $134.45 billion on research and development. The tech sector is a major driver of the economy in Germany, adding over a million jobs and exceeding 230 billion euros in sales revenue. The sector has over 100,000 companies. It accounts for around 7% of the total economic output in Germany. The country also provides a high standard of living, reflected by its HDI score of 0.950.\n\nCurious to learn about other advanced countries?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Monday, recovering mildly after Wall Street logged a series of bruising losses amid growing concerns over an economic slowdown.\n\nAn element of bargain buying also aided stocks, particularly those in the technology sector, after a sharp drop in valuations over the past few weeks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.9% to 5,263.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 1.2% to 18,224.25 points by 19:07 ET (23:07 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.5% to 39,053.0 points.\n\nRecession fears spark deep losses, S&P and Nasdaq at 3-mth lows\n\nConcerns over a drastic slowdown in economic growth, following a string of underwhelming purchasing managers index and labor market readings, saw Wall Street tumble from near record highs over the past two weeks.\n\nLosses came to a head on Monday, with the S&P 500 sliding 3% to 5,186.33 points, while the NASDAQ Composite tumbled 3.4% to 16,208.38 points, with both indexes at three-month lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.6%% to a two-month low of 38,703.27 points.\n\nWeak economic data fueled fears that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates high for too long, and that any cuts by the central bank now would be insufficient in helping the economy gain a soft landing.\n\nStill, markets did increase their expectations for a 50 basis point cut in September, and were pricing in at least 100 bps in rate cuts this year, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nTech steadies from bruising losses\n\nLosses on Wall Street were driven chiefly by extended selling in technology stocks, amid a mix of factors.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was among the worst performers on Monday on news that Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRKa) had halved its stake in the iPhone maker. The stock rose slightly in aftermarket trade.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 2.4% after tumbling over 6% on a report that the firm’s latest artificial intelligence chip will be delayed due to a design flaw.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose slightly after tumbling 4.5%, as a court ruled the firm had violated antitrust law with its search engine.\n\nQ2 earnings set to continue\n\nSome major earnings are still due in the coming days. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) and ride sharing giant Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) are set to report on Tuesday.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) is also due on Tuesday, and is set to offer more cues on demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nMedia giants Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) are due on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures rise after recession fears spark bruising losses\n\nCiti hires Singapore executive from DBS to lead wealth in Asia South\n\nTwo of Jeffrey Epstein's close advisers can face victims' claims\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For months investors have faced a dilemma — pay through the nose for technology giants trading at eye-watering multiples, or wait for a cheaper entry point and risk missing out on the year’s biggest bull run.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk Paris Spent €1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked? Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\n\nThose that chose to sit on the sidelines got a big opportunity to pounce Monday amid a rout that saw the Nasdaq 100 Index fall as much as 5.5%, extending a three-day slump into the double digits. And while many loaded up on shares of Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. at steep discounts to where they traded just days earlier, they were undoubtedly the minority. Most were content to bide their time, unconvinced that the selloff is over.\n\n“I’m waiting for a better opportunity to buy,” said Dan Cook, chief strategy officer with Apex Trader Funding. “I want to see an indication that the pressure has relieved a bit.”\n\nIt was a sentiment echoed by numerous investors amid growing fears of a US recession and concerns over heavy spending on artificial intelligence. While most said they were optimistic over the long-run, few said they were diving head long into the selloff.\n\n“Until we get the next positive driver, the path of least resistance could be down,” Cook added.\n\nWhere that driver will come from, however, remains unclear. Six of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies that have fueled much of this year’s gains have already reported earnings, leaving traders waiting several weeks before AI-darling Nvidia reports on Aug. 28. What’s more, in the wake of last week’s Federal Reserve meeting in which policymakers stood pat, the next gathering won’t be until September.\n\nResults so far have painted a mixed picture of the sector. Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Tesla Inc. all sank in the wake of their reports, which underlined concerns over issues including their growth prospects and spending plans. However, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple both rose following their results, while overall the group demonstrated positive trends for earnings stability and demand even as profit growth is set to slow in the second half of the year.\n\nSo far this season, 80% of companies in the S&P 500 tech index have topped earnings expectations, though fewer than 60% have for revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Last quarter, 90% beat on earnings and 56% did on revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 finished Monday’s session down 3%, well off the 5.5% decline at the start of trading, but still its second-worst day since 2022 (the other coming last month).\n\nWhile dip buying helped soften the blow, plenty of damage was done. Even after paring a drop that at one point sent Nvidia down 15%, the stock closed down 6.4%, erasing $168 billion in market value amid a report that its upcoming Blackwell chip will be delayed. Its shares have now fallen 26% from their June peak.\n\nApple tumbled as much as 11% on Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. cut its stake in the iPhone maker by nearly half. The stock closed down 4.8%.\n\nWhile the selloff has brought valuations down across the board, they’re far from bargain levels. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at 24 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from 28 times a month ago, it’s still above the benchmark’s 10-year average at nearly 22. Nvidia is priced at 31 times estimated earnings, while Apple and Microsoft Corp. are trading around 29 times.\n\n“Valuations aren’t screamingly cheap, but they are defensible,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “A lot of big tech are showing really strong growth, margin expansion, above-average earnings growth. They still deserve pretty healthy multiples, especially if we enter a more normalized rate backdrop.”\n\nThis earnings season has shown that while Big-Tech earnings remain strong, investors are growing more skeptical about heavy spending on AI computing infrastructure and questioning when those investments will begin paying off.\n\nDespite Monday’s carnage, there were some bright spots. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rallied to close up 1.8% amid bets that it’s poised to benefit from a potential Nvidia setback. Chip equipment makers including ASML Holding NV and Lam Research Corp. also rose.\n\n“The market could be still very volatile, but you know, those six or seven or eight things that make up this perfect storm, maybe a couple of them go away and investors get back on the playing field,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management.\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Retailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks shed over $600 billion during selloff—Nvidia hit hardest",
        "content": "Big Tech stocks are having another no good, very bad day. After sending the market to record highs in the first half of 2024, megacap tech names have been among the biggest losers in a global selloff that began in earnest last week and continued Monday.\n\nThe “Magnificent Seven”—a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—became Wall Street’s hot catchphrase after the group accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Shares for all those companies were down at least 3% or more at close Monday, however, with the group losing more then $600 billion in collective market cap.\n\nEven before weaker-than-expected data on the U.S. economy last week reignited recession fears on Wall Street, Big Tech stocks were cooling down. Investors—eyeing a potential Fed rate cut, which has yet to materialize—shifted some of their tech winnings to more value-oriented sectors in what the Wall Street Journalcalled “a stock-market rotation of historic proportions.”\n\nGeopolitical tensions, meanwhile, have recently weighed heavily on chip stocks, including AI darling Nvidia. The chipmaker’s shares dropped 7% Monday, worst among the Magnificent Seven, but have still more than doubled year to date.\n\nThe tech behemoths had to blow out estimates for Q2 earnings calls, Baird’s Ted Mortonson previously told Fortune, to have any hope of quelling the selloff. That didn’t happen, with Amazonin particular missing on revenue and issuing a weak sales outlook last week.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have heard a lot about the Magnificent Seven’s heavy investment in AI, but much less about how it will impact these companies’ top lines in the near term. Regulatory pressure has been ramping up, too, including a ruling from a federal judge on Monday that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over search on Android and Apple iPhone devices.\n\nThe biggest factor driving Big Tech’s losses on Monday, though, was a meltdown on Japan’s Nikkei 225 index, which carried over to U.S. markets at the opening bell. The markets made a partial recovery midday, but information technology overall ended 3.78% down at close, per Bloomberg, the worst of any sector.\n\nWarren Buffett sells half his stake in Apple\n\nApple’s losses were in the spotlight after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed Saturday that it sold almost half its position in America’s largest company during the second quarter.\n\nLike many analysts, Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield emphasized that Buffett’s move was not cause for panic over Apple’s viability. Hatfield noted his firm, however, thought Apple was overvalued at its recent high above the $237 mark. The iPhone maker’s shares dropped almost 5% Monday to take the stock below the $210 mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat value problem was enough for the Oracle of Omaha to dump Apple’s stock—a move long anticipated by Berkshire analysts. It’s not, Hatfield said, an indictment of the U.S. economy.\n\n“The notion that we’re going into recession because he sold Apple is patently ridiculous,” Hatfield said.\n\nAnd even if an economic downturn does materialize, many analysts say Apple—and the rest of the Magnificent Seven—enjoy incredible market dominance and massive free cash flows that can make them relative safety nets for investors. Monday’s selloff doesn’t change that.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

However, about 15% of the total REITs were in the red for the month, and analysts have been downgrading some of them within the past few trading days.\n\nInvestors are advised to use caution after analyst downgrades as stocks can drop several percentage points over the following week.\r\n\r\nEarn potential monthly cash flow from Sunbelt real estate with just $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nTake a look at five REITs that received downgrades this week, some also receiving price cuts:\n\nDigital Realty Trust\n\nDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) is an Austin, TX-based Data Center REIT with over 221,000 cross-connects in 300 facilities across 25 countries. It has over 5,000 customers, including stalwart tech companies such as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Oracle Corp (NASDAQ:ORCL) and IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM).\n\nOn July 25, Digital Realty Trust reported its second-quarter operating results. AFFO of $0.20 missed the $0.24 estimate while revenue of $1.40 billion was ahead of the estimate of $1.38 billion.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Argus Research analyst Marie Ferguson downgraded Digital Realty Trust from Buy to Hold. The analyst believes there will be \"slower growth projections due to slower data center demand and stabilization expectations.\"\n\nTD Cowen analyst Michael Elias also has a Hold rating on Digital Realty Trust with a $120 price target. But analyst Eric Luebchow of Wells Fargo recently maintained Digital Realty at Overweight with a price target of $170.\n\nIn recent news, on July 10, Digital Realty Trust announced it acquired the Slough Data Center Campus in West London for $200 million.\n\nHost Hotels & Resorts\n\nHost Hotels & Resorts Inc (NASDAQ:HST) is a Bethesda, MD-based hotel REIT with 81 hotels containing 43,400 rooms in 21 large markets across the U.S. Host Hotels is the only lodging REIT in the S&P 500 and has been in the index since 2007. Its hotel brands include Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons and Hilton.\n\nOn July 31, Host Hotels reported its Q2 2024 operating results. FFO of $0.57 per share beat the estimate by a penny and its Q2 2023 FFO of $0.53. Revenue of $1.47 billion met the consensus estimate and topped Q2 2023 revenue of $1.39 billion. However, Host Hotels reduced its full-year 2024 diluted earnings outlook from $1.00-$1.08 to $0.95-$1.03 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe same day, Host Hotels announced it had acquired one Hotel Central Park in New York City for $265 million in cash.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Compass Point analyst Floris Van Dijkum downgraded Host Hotels & Resorts from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target by 28% from $25 to $18. However, on the same day, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak maintained Host Hotels & Resorts with a Buy and adjusted the price target from $22 to $21.\n\nPublic Storage\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is a Glendale, CA-based, self-managed self-storage REIT that is one of the largest brands of self-storage services in the United States. Its portfolio includes 3,369 self-storage facilities with 243 million rentable square feet across 40 states. Its Market Cap of $52.88 billion is the largest among all self-storage facilities.\n\nPublic Storage also sells packing and moving supplies and provides insurance services as well. Public Storage was founded in 1972 and became a publicly traded REIT in 1995 when it merged with Storage Equities. It was added to the S&P 500 in 2005.\n\nOn July 30, Public Storage released its Q2 2024 operating results. FFO of $4.23 per share beat the estimate of $4.21. Revenue of $1.17 billion was in line with estimates and improved 4.5% year over year. Public Storage also said it's reducing its full-year FFO forecast from $16.60-$17.20 to $16.50-$16.85.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Truist Securities analyst Ki Bin Kim downgraded Public Storage from Buy to Hold and maintained the price target at $306. The analyst noted that Public Storage's advantage over its peers in rent trends is diminishing.\n\nOn Aug. 2, Public Storage declared a quarterly dividend of $3.00 per share, matching its previous seven quarters. The dividend is payable on Sept. 30 for shareholders of record on Sept. 13, also the ex-dividend date. The forward yield is 4.0%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nFinance companies are leaving New York for this hot city. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible. With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.\n\nCommunity Healthcare Trust\n\nCommunity Healthcare Trust Inc (NYSE:CHCT) is a Franklin, TN-based self-managed health care REIT that owns 198 properties with 318 tenants across 35 states. Its diverse portfolio includes medical office buildings, specialty centers, behavioral facilities and inpatient rehabilitation centers.\n\nOn July 26, Community Healthcare Trust increased its second-quarter dividend from $0.46 to $0.4625 per share.\n\nOn July 30, Community Healthcare announced its Q2 operating results. FFO of $0.53 missed the estimate of $0.55, and revenue of $27.516 million missed the forecast of $30.665 million. It's somewhat unusual for a REIT to miss on earnings right after increasing its dividend.\n\nOn July 31, Evercore ISI Group analyst Steve Sakwa downgraded Community Healthcare from In-Line to Underperform and lowered the price target from $27 to $25. The same day, Baird analyst Amanda Sweitzer maintained Community Healthcare at Neutral and lowered the price target from $29 to $25.\n\nHealthcare Realty Trust\n\nHealthcare Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:HR) is a Nashville, TN-based health care REIT with 673 properties covering 39.7 million square feet across 35 states. It was established in 1992 with only 21 facilities and has evolved into a delivery model in which 72% of its properties are multi-tenant medical outpatient service buildings on the campus of hospitals or other types of health care facilities.\n\nIn 2022, Healthcare Realty merged with Healthcare Trust of America in an $18 billion deal and became Healthcare Realty Trust. The top locations of its properties include Dallas, Seattle and Houston.\n\nOn July 30, Wells Fargo analyst Joseph Feldman downgraded Healthcare Realty Trust from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $17 to $16. The analyst noted that Healthcare Realty's stock buybacks at current levels won't offset the diminishing benefits of its asset dispositions.\n\nPerhaps analyst Feldman had an inkling of what was to come because, on Aug. 2, Healthcare Realty Trust reported somewhat disappointing Q2 earnings. FFO of $0.38 was in-line but down from $0.39 year-over-year. Revenue of $316.32 million was shy of the estimate of $322.00 million and below Q2 2023 revenue of $338.14 million.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "7 Hidden Generative AI Stocks Worthy of the Spotlight",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a groundbreaking innovation — you don’t need me to tell you that. At the same time, you don’t necessarily need to pay “full retail” to gain exposure to this burgeoning ecosystem. So yes, generative AI stocks do look appealing, especially with the tech sector fallout recently. Still, it may be better to focus on value rather than chasing the hyped names.\n\nAs I mentioned in my Trade of the Day article for InvestorPlace, the smart money is betting against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). If it was just a one-off incident, maybe it wouldn’t be so alarming. However, for multiple sessions, options traders have been placing wagers against NVDA stock. The company that provides the hardware for machine intelligence may have more to drop.\n\nOf course, other generative AI stocks have struggled amid the crimson wave; indeed, not many innovation-related enterprises have been exempted from the crash. Still, for the patient, forward-looking investor, these machine-intelligence plays look awfully enticing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinance and tax software Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) makes for an intriguing idea for hidden generative AI stocks, thanks to its underlying utility. Taxes are complicated, especially for those who operate as independent contractors or who run small businesses. Even employees — who typically file simplified tax returns — face complications when dealing with certain taxable events. This is where machine intelligence can help.\n\nAlso, Intuit just happens to be one of the generative AI stocks holding its own. For example, data from Yahoo! Finance notes that the S&P 500 return comes in at 19%. During the same period, INTC stock gained 25%. To be sure, Intuit suffered late last week due to the tech sector’s fallout. However, the pain wasn’t nearly as pronounced as other tech entities.\n\nOverall, that’s encouraging, overall as the company has been performing well. In the past year, since the first quarter, Intuit posted an average earnings per share of $4.16, above the average estimate of $3.77. By the end of the fiscal year, analysts are projecting EPS growth of nearly 17% to $16.83. Revenue should rise 12.6% to $16.19 billion.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving onto the other side of the spectrum, UiPath (NYSE:PATH) represents one of the hardest-hit generative AI stocks. Again, citing data from Yahoo! Finance, PATH stock incurred a 52-week loss of 29.52%. Again, the benchmark equities index gained over 18% during this period. While an ugly situation, forward-looking investors may focus on the company’s core strength: providing robotic process automation software that enhances the capabilities of machine intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nPATH stock might be ugly, but a silver lining could exist in this mess. Right now, shares trade hands at 4.78x trailing-year sales. That’s not particularly undervalued compared to other software companies. However, in the past year, the market accepted a multiple of 8.85x. It’s conceivable that with the right catalyst, UiPath could return to its prior valuation.\n\nHow feasible is this projection? Well, analysts anticipate that fiscal 2025 (calendar 2024) sales will rise to $1.41 billion. That’s up 7.7% from the prior year. In the following, revenue might hit $1.58 billion, up 11.9% from forecasted ’24 sales. Thus, PATH ranks among the generative AI stocks to consider.\n\nVeritone (VERI) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOperating in the software infrastructure field, Veritone (NASDAQ:VERI) offers AI computing solutions and services in the U.S. and other markets. As with its peers among generative AI stocks, VERI is volatile. Per Yahoo! Finance, its beta stands at 3.34. Keep in mind that the beta for the stock market is only 1. Sure enough, shares lost almost 41% of equity value in the past 52 weeks.\n\nCircumstances look ugly now but with the company’s aiWARE platform — an AI operating system — Veritone could potentially enhance the capabilities of machine intelligence. As such, it may be worth keeping on your radar. One of the enticing factors when it comes to the recent volatility is, of course, valuation. Right now, shares trade at 0.7x sales, which is low as it is. In the past year, the metric stood at 0.92x.\n\nFurther, the lone analyst covering VERI stock believes that revenue has the potential to hit $137.9 million. That would be up 8.1% from the prior year’s tally of $127.56 million. Fiscal 2025 could add to that, with sales rising to $141.3 million.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA member of the infrastructure software industry, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) provides electronic design automation software products that are used to design and test integrated circuits or ICs. With machine intelligence putting more demand on the semiconductor arena, Synopsys could rise in value. As enterprises invest more dollars into their advanced protocols, the company’s revenue streams should expand accordingly.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that SNPS stock has been holding its own. In the past one-year period, the equity gained just under 14%. Again, that’s quite decent compared to the benchmark index’s performance of 18%-plus. It’s also less volatile than other generative AI stocks, featuring a five-year beta of 1.07.\n\nNow, it did take a hit on Friday, losing more than 6%. Nevertheless, that could be an opportunity. Yes, SNPS stock trades at 12.46x sales, which is quite high compared to the industry. However, in the past year, the market previously accepted a multiple of 13.53x.\n\nBy year’s end, sales could rise 13.1% to $6.13 billion. It’s one of the top ideas for generative AI stocks to keep on your watchlist.\n\nElastic (ESTC) Closeup of the homepage of Close CRM website, a subsidiary of Elastic Inc.,\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother entity within the application software realm, Elastic (NYSE:ESTC) is an AI-based search company. It delivers hosted and managed solutions, designed to run in hybrid, public or private clouds, along with multi-cloud environments. Primarily, the company offers its Elastic Stack, a set of software products that assess and store data from multiple sources.\n\nMoving forward, ESTC could be an attractive idea for generative AI stocks, thanks to its ability to absorb unstructured data and yield meaningful results out of it. Sure enough, the market recognizes the opportunity. In the past year, ESTC stock gained nearly 64% of equity value. However, last Friday, shares incurred a loss of nearly 5%.\n\nThat could be an opportunity. Admittedly, ESTC runs hot, carrying a sales multiple of 8.38x. However, during its fiscal fourth quarter, the company ran a multiple of nearly 10x. So, it’s relatively undervalued.\n\nBy year’s end, sales may rise to $1.48 billion, up 16.6% from last year. In the following year, revenue could bump up again to $1.73 billion.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3IoT (AI) website displayed on a modern smartphone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBilled as an enterprise AI software company, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) is becoming more intriguing as one of the generative AI stocks. That’s because it serves a wide range of entities, including government agencies. This includes the defense sector, which ranks as one of the growth arenas. While the market is struggling, the relevance of defense plays has risen due to geopolitical flashpoints.\n\nTo be fair, that dynamic hasn’t spared AI stock, which lost more than 5% on Friday. Also, critics will point out that C3.ai has been a laggard, losing over 35% of its value in the past year. Still, the bright side is that the valuation of the enterprise looks more attractive. It’s not objectively cheap compared to the industry, carrying a 9.39x sales multiple. However, in the past year, this metric stood at 11.53x on average.\n\nAlso, it’s worth pointing out that roughly in the year-ago quarter, the sales multiple stood at 17.29x. So, investors may be getting a deal here. Covering experts are looking to the current fiscal year to generate $383.39 million on the top line. If so, that would imply growth of over 23.4%.\n\nCerence (CRNC) Automated stock trading concept. Robotic hand analyzing financial data on stock exchange, artificial intelligence utilization to predict precise price change in stock market. Trailblazing. trillion-dollar ai stocks. AI Stocks with Potential. stocks to buy. Strong Buy AI Stocks\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational software company, Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) develops AI assistant technology, primarily for the automotive sector. Fundamentally, it’s one of the most relevant generative AI stocks thanks to its synergistic potential. In the mobility space, companies are already digging deep to reach the holy grail of full autonomy. Therefore, Cerence could be part of a massive paradigm shift.\n\nHowever, CRNC stock is incredibly risky and volatile. To be clear, both things — strong narrative and wild volatility — can be true at the same time. Basically, the bottom line here is that investors shouldn’t enter without fully understanding the dangers. In the past 52 weeks, CRNC stock dropped almost 90%. That’s a good start in terms of risk disclosure.\n\nIs there a silver lining? Well, I suppose that CRNC stock trading at 0.32x sales may be attractive. In the prior year, this multiple stood at 2.87x. Now, a lot needs to happen before Cerence regains that same valuation.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking at revenue of $324.6 million, up 10.2%. That’s not nothing. However, more conservative speculators may want to wait until later this week when Cerence discloses its Q2 earnings results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Monday?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) stock traded lower on Monday, following the broader semiconductor industry selloff.\n\nArtificial intelligence stocks, led by crucial Big Tech supplier Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which have driven much of 2024’s market gains, fell on Monday as fears of a U.S. recession triggered a global selloff on Wall Street, CNBC reports.\n\nThe semiconductor selloff followed Friday’s disappointing July jobs report, which heightened recession worries and concerns that the Federal Reserve is slow to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.\n\nThe semiconductor selloff was amplified by reports indicating Nvidia’s AI chip production issues.\n\nTaiex gauge plummeted by a record 8.4% Monday, mainly reflecting the selloff of AI chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor, whose shares fell by 9.8% in a single day, Bloomberg reports.\n\nA Bloomberg report last week indicated that Taiwan Semiconductor is enjoying a boost in retail ownership in Taiwan despite foreign investors’ retreat.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Taiwan Semiconductor contributed 8% of Taiwan’s GDP in 2022.\n\nTaiwan stock gained over 53% in the last 12 months despite losing 20% in the last 30 days in the U.S.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research can be a valuable source of information for learning about a company's fundamentals.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell roughly 8% in early trading as the Magnificent 7 stocks saw their worst intraday market cap loss ever during Monday's market plunge.\n\nAs of 10:00 a.m. ET the 'Mag 7' group was down more than $860 billion in market valuation. Together the Mag 7 stocks make up roughly 43% of the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) weighting.\n\nThe other components of the group also dropped with Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) and Meta (META) falling more than 3%.

Read them carefully before investing.\n\nBezos started the family office in 2005 and through the years it has primarily focused on technology, with 70% of its investments in that camp. As Bezos moves toward artificial intelligence, that may reflect not just his interests but the number of exciting companies starting up in that space and the potential for significant advancements and lots of money.\n\nOne of his investments is Perplexity AI, which builds an AI search engine. It raised $63 million in April, pushing it into unicorn territory with a billion-dollar valuation. Perplexity, which uses a variety of large language models to deliver its results, was recently accused of plagiarism. It has instituted a publisher program to compensate publishers with a share of ad revenue when their content comes up in search results.\n\nAnother unicorn in the Bezos stable is Skikd AI, which works on the operating system for multipurpose robots that can be used everywhere from construction sites and factories to homes. Bezos Expeditions was part of a $300 million funding round that included investments from Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and SoftBank Group. The funding brings the company to a valuation of $1.5 billion.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe third unicorn may be the biggest of them all, at least so far. Figure raised $675 million in February with support from Bezos and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the OpenAI Startup Fund, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and others. Figure is an AI robotics company that builds humanoid robots. It is collaborating with OpenAI on AI models to create robots that can process and reason from language. Figure and BMW are partnering to bring humanoid robots into automotive production.\n\nOne of the largest AI companies, Anthropic, has received over $4 billion in investments from Amazon. It is big enough now that it is launching its own fund to support new AI talent. Anthropic and Menlo Ventures, a well-established Bay Area venture capital firm, recently announced the Anthology Fund. It will offer financial backing through Menlo Ventures and $25,000 in credits for using its large language models.\n\nAll these monster rounds and Bezos's contribution to them may indicate that the most prominent AI companies are yet to hit the market. For stock market investors, most of the opportunities to invest in AI so far have come from established companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia. While none of the companies above have indicated that they are planning for an initial public offering anytime soon, it seems likely that at least one of them will at some point.\n\nCheck it Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -14.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 13%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +137%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 points to a change of +106.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +25.8% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109%. The $117.82 billion and $152.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +93.4% and +29.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 High-Growth Stocks Trading at Fair Value",
        "content": "The explosion of artificial intelligence has made it quite difficult to find high-growth stocks trading at fair value. Chip stocks provide an excellent example of this truth, but it’s widely applicable to all things tech and high growth currently.\n\nInvestors are willing to pay more than double the industry average for a dollar of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth right now. That’s after a pull back that has seen share prices fall from $134 to $112.\n\nThat phenomenon isn’t solely true of the semiconductor sector. The “Magnificent Seven” and many other shares adjacent to artificial intelligence are similarly high priced.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, there are high growth opportunities available to investors that trade at fair prices. Many of them have fallen back to the fairly priced range after their respective sectors suffered setbacks. That sets up a scenario for investors to take advantage of one of few opportunities to get growth at a reasonable price.\n\nON Semiconductor (ON) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) stock currently trades for just over $67. That’s slightly below the $69 price it should trade at based on earnings-per-share forecasts for this year and price to earnings projections. In other words, it is fairly priced.\n\nYet the analysts responsible for rating ON Semiconductor — or “onsemi” — have given it a consensus price of $86. The company is highly connected to the electric vehicle sector. That fact explains its relative value at the moment: EV stocks have fallen out of favor as sales slump and pricing competition makes the sector less attractive.\n\nTake the opportunity because onsemi has been selected to power Volkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) next-generation EVs. The company will provide the chips that power the power sub assembly. A power sub assembly is a series of interconnected components that collectively manage and distribute power in a vehicle.\n\nThe win is further proof that onsemi is a real leader in the EV chip space and current share prices make it a good time to buy.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock trades for $213 currently, although analysts believe it is worth closer to $276. Based on earnings and P/E projections, it should trade precisely where it is.\n\nIt’s a very interesting trade because First Solar is subject to so many dynamic catalysts at the moment. It is at the center of political narratives. Roughly 80% of the company’s net income in 2023 was attributable to Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies. That truth sent the shares tumbling following the debate between Biden and Trump which greatly improved Trump’s chances of reelection. However, some believe First Solar isn’t exposed to large risks, even if Trump is reelected. Many GOP controlled districts have accepted IRA subsidies thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company could also benefit from a Trump presidency as he would likely put additional pressure on Chinese solar imports.\n\nIt all suggests that the recent reaction to First Solar was likely an overreaction.\n\nJabil (JBL) The fiber laser cutting machine cutting the sheet metal plate with the sparking light.Hi-technology manufacturing concept.\n\nSource: Pixel B / Shutterstock.com\n\nJabil (NYSE:JBL) is a manufacturing services firm serving the electronics sector. The stock that represents the company is underappreciated but simultaneously offers high growth to investors.\n\nShares currently trade for $99 which is well below the consensus target price and the low target as well. That price is appropriate based on forward earnings and P/E ratio forecasts, however. All of which suggests that Jabil is an opportunity for investors to pick up its high growth shares at a fair price currently.\n\nYet Jabil represents something of a paradox because revenues are falling in 2024. Yet the company also expects earnings to grow by 40% this year. Earnings are then expected to grow by 25% in 2025. That suggests Jabil is a high-growth stock trading at a fair price right now and presents an opportunity overall.\n\nJabil also includes a modest dividend yielding 0.3% currently. It’s arguably a fit for income investors as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Recession fears cloud equities outlook",
        "content": "Stocks fell sharply on Friday following a surprisingly weak July jobs report, fueling concerns about a potential economic recession.\n\nThe broad market index dropped 1.84% to close at 5,346.56. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.43% to 16,776.16, marking a decline of over 10% from its recent peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 610.71 points, or 1.51%, ending the day at 39,737.26.\n\nThe sell-off came as investors reacted to a significant slowdown in U.S. job growth for July, coupled with a rise in the unemployment rate to its highest level since October 2021. According to the Labor Department, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 114,000 in July, down from 179,000 in June and falling short of the 185,000 forecasted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nThe Nasdaq has now entered correction territory, having dropped more than 10% from its all-time high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow are 5.7% and 3.9% below their record highs, respectively.\n\nThe negative sentiment persisted on Monday, with all major stock futures trading in the red as Japan’s Nikkei and Topix indexes each plummeted more than 12%.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the favorite AI-related stocks and the key driving force behind the recent bull market, saw its shares tumble 13% in premarket trading.\n\nThe sharp sell-off prompted economists to reevaluate their interest rate cut predictions as they believe the Federal Reserve will now have to act earlier than expected to support a slowing economy. Goldman Sachs anticipates three consecutive 25 basis points cuts by year-end in September, November, and December.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, investors will focus on key economic indicators for further insights into trends, particularly the ISM services report on Monday and the jobless claims report on Thursday.\n\n“We estimate that the ISM services index rebounded 1.7pt to 50.5 in July, reflecting partial convergence toward our non-manufacturing survey tracker (which stands at 52.3 for July) but a potential headwind from seasonality,” Goldman economists said in a note.\n\nIn addition, several Fed officials will speak in the coming days.\n\nThis week's earnings spotlight: SMCI, Caterpillar , Walt Disney\n\nApart from the disappointing July employment data, investors are also concerned about the elevated valuations in the wake of the AI rally, with rising geopolitical risks in the Middle East also adding to the risk-off sentiment.\n\nAlthough all Big Tech companies have already unveiled their latest earnings, several other important reports are expected this week.\n\nSpecifically, this includes earnings reports from Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), The Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co., and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBTIG: “It's been a long time coming, but the fulcrum from markets trading 'bad news is good' to 'bad is bad' appears to be here. Therefore, lower rates are likely to be met with lower stock prices, as we have seen over the last couple of days. As far as the SPX goes, the recent pullback gets us closer to a possible washout, but we still see some risk towards 5200. Internals have weakened, but given the rotation into defensives, they remain far from what we typically see at tradable lows.”\n\nWedbush: “We are getting inbounds from investors around the world today/over the weekend asking us if this tech bull market and historic run for tech stocks is over? It's NOT in our view and this is just a white knuckle moment in a multi-year bull run for tech stocks that need hand holding. We have battled through this bull/bear debate a number of times over the past few years as well as the last few decades covering tech stocks on the Street. Our view its a soft landing environment, the Fed is in a major cutting cycle the next 18 months, AI represents a new build out for the tech world not seen since the start of the Internet, AND this is not a bubble and tech vendors will start to show the monetization/use cases/growth over the next 6-9 months to validate the valuations.”\n\nMorgan Stanley: “It’s worth noting that valuations are sensitive to earnings revisions breadth, which turned negative last month. The last time S&P 500 earnings revisions breadth rolled over into negative territory was last fall. Between July and October 2023, the market multiple declined from 20x to 17x. Two weeks ago, the P/E was 22x, and it is now at 20x. If earnings revisions continue to fade, as the seasonal trends suggest they will, it’s likely these valuations have further to fall. With our 12-month base case target multiple at 19x, the risk/reward for equities broadly remains unfavorable. Under the surface of the market, we continue to recommend a quality + defensive (rather than growth) bias.”\n\nRBC Capital Markets: “We’ve thought a pullback in the S&P 500 would likely settle out in the 5-10% range. Ones significantly more than that in recent decades tend to be associated with growth scares (10-20% declines) or recessions (which most pullbacks 20% or more end up being associated with). We still have questions about the jobs report, specifically on weather. For now, 10% remains our assumption for how deep a pullback could go but we’re monitoring the jobs discussion closely for risk of a growth scare settling in given how skittish investors appear to be.”\n\nUBS: “Similar to what we witnessed amidst the small-cap rotation a few weeks ago, the degree of moves was clearly exacerbated by stretched positioning, in our view. The difference today is there is fundamental backing to elevated levels of risk premia, from both a macro and earnings perspective. But have we gone too far, too fast? Aggressive rate cuts priced into the market post-NFPs and the coincident move in the front-end of the yield curve appears to be an overshooting, per our Rates Strategists. Our US Equity Strategists flagged that VIX > 25 has historically been a buying opportunity for stocks. We echo this sentiment, but note the risks appear to be skewed more asymmetrically to the downside.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWall St set to tumble as recession worries spook investors\n\nMagnificent Seven set to shed $1 trillion in value, led by Apple, Nvidia\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI Frenzy is Not Over: 5 Stocks in Focus at Lucrative Valuation",
        "content": "The astonishing rally of U.S. stocks that started at the beginning of 2023 was predominantly driven by the technology sector. An unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world was the prime factor.\n\nAs expectations for a rate cut in September reached 100%, investors’ preference shifted from these extremely overvalued AI stocks to the beaten-down rate-sensitive cyclical stocks. Moreover, fear of a recession, following the release of a few weaker-than-expected key economic data, raises concerns that big companies may not maintain their current level of gigantic expenditure for AI-related R&D.\n\nConsequently, AI stocks suffered the maximum brunt of a recent stock market meltdown. On Aug 2, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite entered into correction territory as it fell more than 10% from its recent high recorded on Jul 11.\n\nIs Recession Nearby or a Knee-Jerk Expression?\n\nTheoretically a recession means contraction of GDP (negative GDP growth rate) for two consecutive quarters. The U.S. GDP grew at 1.4% in first-quarter 2024. The first reading of second-quarter GDP was 2.8%. On Aug 1, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow projected a 2.5% GDP growth rate for the third quarter.\n\nSome soft key economic data over a period of time never indicate a nearby recession. In fact, the Fed was eagerly waiting for these weak economic data, especially labor market data, along with a gradually declining inflation rate, in order to initiate a rate-cut regime.\n\nFinally, the recent AI turmoil is nothing but profit-taking, especially on the part of institutional investors. Stock markets consist of bull and bear operators. As bulls fly high, bears wait quietly for a suitable time and some reasons to be good enough for profit-booking so that they can reenter the market at a reasonably low level. Stock prices of most of the AI giants have skyrocketed 100-400% in the past 19 months. Therefore, the speculation of a market correction was rife in the last couple of months.\n\nAI Frenzy Remains Intact\n\nSo far, no negative news appears for the generative AI ecosystem. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that generative AI spending will increase from $67 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2032. PricewaterhouseCoopers International Ltd. estimated that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion should come from consumption-side effects.\n\n5 AI Giants in Focus At an Attractive Level\n\nThe recent meltdown has made several AI bigwigs attractive from a long-term investment point of view. AI turmoil may continue for the next few days. Investors should keenly watch these five stocks to create a lucrative portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM has become a new poster boy on the global AI frenzy. The company is the largest manufacturer of AI-based chipsets for the world’s best AI chipset developers. TSM reported excellent results for second-quarter 2024 beating both top and bottom lines estimates, supported by a 3-nanometer chipset boom.\n\nThe growing adoption of its multi-project wafer processing service, which allows customers to reduce mask costs, is driving its customer momentum. TSM’s growing efforts to ramp up the production of 3nm and development of 2nm is a plus.\n\nFor third-quarter 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor projects revenues between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. The company also expects more than 20% growth in 2024 revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and 2024 revenues is pegged at $22.72 billion and $85.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 31.5% and 23%, respectively.\n\nThe consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.69 per share, suggesting year-over-year growth of 31%. The estimate has been revised upward by 8.3% in the last 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.37 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 18.9%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.9% in the last 30 days.\n\nThe stock price has plunged 22.5% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 29.4% from the last closing price of $149.86. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $170-$250. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. TSM currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. This undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products.\n\nOn May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company’s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Within the series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor.\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called “Rubin.” Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027. On Jul 22, Reuters reported that the company is working on a B20 version of its flagship chipset for the Chinese market that would be compatible with current U.S. export restrictions.\n\nNVDA will report second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results on Aug 28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 1.6% over the last 30 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has slid 23.8% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 29.4% from the last closing price of $107.27. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $90-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. SMCI has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI’s top and bottom lines. In order to support aggressive workloads, data centers are aggressively demanding high-density rack space and direct-to-chip liquid cooling.\n\nThe company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI’s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSuper Micro Computer will report fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 earnings results on Aug 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for last-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings has remained the same over the last 60 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has plummeted 49.2% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 53.1% from the last closing price of $624.65. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $325-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA’s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supplies. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.4% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings have improved 13.7% and 26.1, respectively, over the last 60 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 73.2%.\n\nThe stock price has tumbled 41.2% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 61.8i% from the last closing price of $92.70. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100-$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSnowflake Inc. SNOW is a major company providing cloud infrastructure to AI-based ecosystems. SNOW’s platform offers Data Cloud, which enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data and data products applying AI for solving business problems.\n\nSNOW helps large enterprises using multiple public cloud services and their own servers to aggregate data into a “data pool” that produces a single source of information. Snowflake’s Cortex AI platform enables businesses to fine-tune models for their specific use, search unstructured data, and use AI to produce valuable insights. SNOW also offers its “Copilot” tool with Cortex AI architecture.\n\nSnowflake will report second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings results on Aug 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has improved 6.7% over the last 30 days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 74.8%.\n\nThe stock price has plunged 49.6% from its 52-week high. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 57.3% from the last closing price of $119.77. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $105-$240. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).

        "content": "Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) has experienced its worst-ever daily selloff on Monday, amid panic selling triggered by fears of a possible US recession that is spilling over to European markets.\n\nAt the close in Tokyo on Monday, the benchmark index was down 4,451.28 points, or 12.40%, to 31,458.42.\n\nIt is the largest point fall ever, eclipsing the decline on 20 October 1987, the day after Black Monday in New York. It is the second largest decline in percentage terms, according to Nikkei data.\n\nThe panic selling extended across Asia, with markets in Singapore (^STI), Indonesia (^JKSE), Thailand (^SET.BK), and the Philippines (PSEI.PS) also experiencing drops of 2% to 3%. These declines triggered circuit breakers, temporarily halting trading for 20 minutes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks dip as Japan's Nikkei slumps\n\nJapanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki expressed \"grave concern\" as the government closely monitors the market situation.\n\nAsian markets getting hammered this morning.

There are a lot of moving parts, but this is the essence of things: a looming slowdown in the US economy has cast doubts about global economic growth.\n\n\"The move has triggered a sell-off in the US dollar and a rally in the yen, the latter of which was boosted by the BOJ’s [Bank of Japan's] decision to tighten policy last week and a subsequent short-squeeze.\n\n“The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it’s also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks. We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Disney, Airbnb, Bitcoin, Pershing Square\n\n“The rapidity of the move has caught a lot of investors off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”\n\nThe market rout has spilled over, with US treasury yields falling further, European stock indexes in the red, bitcoin dumped and the dollar losing ground mainly to the yen.\n\nLondon’s blue-chip index (^FTSE) was as much as 2.22% down, losing 196 points to hit 7,978.59 at the time of writing, with equities across the board falling into the red. It is the sharpest fall in London’s benchmark index since July last year.\n\nThe Dax (^GDAXI) in Frankfurt sank more than 2.6% while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slumped 2.3%. Elsewhere, Milan (FTSEMIB.MI) plunged 3.1% and Madrid (^IBEX) gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency (BTC-USD) fell by 15% to $51,400, adding to a 13.1% drop last week.\n\nIt has suffered its worst fall since the so-called “crypto winter” when the FTX exchange imploded in 2022.\n\n#Bitcoin is down more than 16% in the past 24 hours. This is a stark reminder that Bitcoin is, by far, the asset class with the highest #volatility, which must be considered when constructing a portfolio that includes Bitcoin.\r\n(The Bitcoin Emergency Brake in the Blokland Smart… pic.twitter.com/5b6jDkNgEr\n\n— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) August 5, 2024\n\nBig Tech stocks are heading for further losses when Wall Street trading begins.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (^VIX) – used to gauge turbulence in stock markets – has surged to its highest level since the pandemic.\n\nAmid the panic selling, trader are increasingly betting on imminent interest rate cuts.

        "content": "With the painful market sell-off kicking things up a notch to start the month of August, it’s not hard to imagine many investors are seeking an exit point from some of their vulnerable stocks. Indeed, those “AI bubble” fears you may have heard about feel more real than ever. This is especially true with the Nasdaq 100 sinking into correction territory in just a few weeks.\n\nThough it’s always scary to catch a falling knife, market sell-offs do tend to be great buying opportunities in the grander scheme of things. At least this is true for pain-tolerant investors.\n\nFor everybody else, the latest sell-off may be ringing alarm bells. This is especially true for semiconductor investors who’ve refused to take profits amid the past few years of incredible gains. It’s impossible to tell which stocks will crash from here and by how much. However, the following names, I believe, look technically unsound and still expensive.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTime will tell how the market sell-off plays out in August. I think it’ll be a great longer-term buying opportunity for those who pick their spots carefully. However, if you’re too heavy in the following names, it’s likely not too late to do some trimming.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) seems like the perfect stock to bet against if you believe there’s an AI bubble bursting. Though I don’t view AI stocks as in a dot com era-esque type of bubble, it’s hard to argue that a lot of froth has built up in some of the past year’s biggest AI winners.\n\nAt the time of this writing, SMCI stock is rolling over fast. The AI data center top dog has shed more than 47% of its value since peaking back in March. Despite getting cut nearly in half, SMCI shares are still up 118% year to date. Clearly, the stock could get cut in half again and still be in the green on the year.\n\nWith the company launching an intriguing plug-and-play infrastructure solution for the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Omniverse, the firm is making shows that it still has the AI growth chops. And while the stock looks like a steal at 34.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s tough to get behind the name as investors turn against tech and AI in a big way.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) added fuel to the broad stock market sell-off after it missed the mark on revenues for the second quarter. In response, AMZN stock plunged almost 9%, as investors quickly threw in the towel on the fast-recovering Magnificent Seven e-commerce kingpin.\n\nStory continues\n\nSure, Amazon’s top line technically fell short of estimates, but not by much. Net sales of $147.98 billion were just a hair shy of the $148.56 billion estimate—a miss by less than a percentage point!\n\nMeanwhile, cloud growth came in at a somewhat decent 19%, ahead of estimates but still less than some faster-moving public cloud firms. Relatively speaking, Amazon Web Services is walking briskly while some rivals may be sprinting into the cloud with AI.\n\nIn any case, I think the 9% single-day dip was overblown beyond proportion. Despite this, I’d not want to catch the falling knife immediately after earnings, as it’s still up a great deal from the 2022 lows. Still, this is one of the most vulnerable stocks.\n\nLululemon (LULU) A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.\n\nSource: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) stock, which shed another 5% of its value last Friday as broader markets crumbled. While the maker of yoga wear is insulated from the blast zone of AI and tech, the company has its own slate of unique woes that could be very hard to recover from.\n\nTrendy fashions, like athleisure, tend to be just that: trendy. And, as you may know, chasing hot trends can be a risky endeavor as an investor. I have no idea where Lululemon goes from here as its stock sinks to multi-year depths not seen since 2020.\n\nWith the apparel firm recently getting slapped with a major downgrade from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Brooke Roach, perhaps it’s time to part ways with LULU stock for good. Roach cut her price target by a whopping $177 to $286 per share.\n\nWhy is Roach’s confidence “fading” on the name?\n\nLululemon’s new Breezethrough leggings, which were paused in response to harsh customer criticism, have Roach concerned about “near-term execution.” She’s spot-on; the downgrade is more than warranted. Breezethrough was a disaster that couldn’t have come at a worse time and certainly one of the most vulnerable stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Amazon.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple and Nvidia led a sell-off in technology stocks on Monday as U.S. recession fears and Berkshire Hathaway's decision to cut its stake in the iPhone maker punctured a months-long rally in the sector.\n\nHigh-performing shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla fell as much as 12.2% in premarket trading.\n\nThe losses in the Magnificent Seven stocks were set to wipe out nearly $1 trillion from the combined market value of the companies.\n\nChip stocks, the big winners of Wall Street's picks and shovels trade for AI, also tumbled, with Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom falling as much as 10.3%.\n\nThe share slide followed a weak U.S. payrolls report on Friday that pushed investors to safe assets and spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will have to soon cut interest rates to aid growth.\n\nOver the weekend, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had halved its stake in Apple - the conglomerate's top holding - in a stock-selling spree that raised worries about the outlook for the tech industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia shares took a hit from a report that the launch of its upcoming AI chips could be delayed by three months due to design flaws, which could impact customers such as Facebook-parent Meta, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft.\n\nAfter driving gains on Wall Street for more than a year, big technology stocks have come under pressure in the past few weeks also on signs that the payoff from hefty AI investments would take longer than some investors had initially hoped.\n\nShares of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - the three biggest providers of cloud-computing services - fell as their earnings reports dashed big bets of hefty AI investments translating quickly into growth.\n\n\"Expectations have arguably become too high for the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Their success has made them untouchable in the eyes of investors and when they fall short of greatness, out come the knives,\" Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

Moreover, the AI sector is seen as entering a new growth phase, reminiscent of the early days of the internet.\n\nThis earnings season has reinforced Wedbush's positive outlook, with strong performances and optimistic forecasts from major tech players.\n\nThey note that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have shown robust cloud growth, and the AI monetization phase is gaining momentum.\n\n\"We focus on tech spending and the winners that will be front and center in this massive AI tech buildout,\" Wedbush emphasizes.\n\n\"We would strongly focus more on what is happening at the likes at Apple (bullish conf. call and outlook from Cook), Nvidia, Microsoft (Azure 2H accel), Alphabet, Amazon (AWS monster number), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as barometers and see the forest through the trees despite this morning's carnage,\" they concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nNow not the time to panic on the tech trade, bargain hunt after selloff: Wedbush\n\nElon Musk revives lawsuit against Sam Altman and OpenAI, filing shows\n\nTyson Foods beats Q3 estimates, shares rise on strong results\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple: Which $3 Trillion-Dollar Stock Is the Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Play?",
        "content": "While the current buzzword for the hottest tech stocks might be the \"Magnificent Seven,\" that could soon turn into the Terrific Three.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and the remainder of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple all have market caps in the range of $3 trillion, and all are among the leaders in the AI revolution in different ways.\n\nNvidia is the leading chipmaker, building the AI infrastructure that is powering new large language models and applications like ChatGPT. More than any other company, Nvidia has defined the current AI era, and its stock has been the biggest gainer based on market cap.\n\nMicrosoft has established itself as a leader in AI applications thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker, and it has forged a close partnership with OpenAI, which has allowed it to deploy ChatGPT across a wide range of products, including Azure, its Office suite, GitHub, and Bing, and the AI-based Copilot, as well as other AI tools already driving meaningful growth for Microsoft.\n\nFinally, Apple has been somewhat late to the AI party, but the iPhone maker can't be ignored when it comes to a new technology like AI. That's because Apple has an installed base of active devices of 2.2 billion, meaning that it controls the connectivity to AI for billions of users. Apple is also releasing Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools like a writing assistant, which is expected to be available to consumers shortly. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple stack up against each other\n\nAs the descriptions show, all three of these companies have their own strengths in AI, and all three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in the AI era. However, Nvidia has been the clear winner during that time, as the chart below shows. NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia is also the most expensive stock of the three based on its trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 65, compared to Microsoft at 37 and Apple at 33.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is also the fastest-growing of the three stocks and is expected to grow revenue by 98% this year, compared to Microsoft at 16% and Apple at 8%.\n\nBecause of that, Nvidia' forward P/E is much lower, at just 40, bringing it more in line with that of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nWhich is the best AI play?\n\nOf the three stocks, Nvidia's future is the most closely tied to AI. Its revenue more than tripled over its last four quarters as it's become the de facto supplier of GPUs and other components needed for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's also moving fast to release new products and stay on the cutting edge of AI and ahead of the competition. The company just announced a suite of services and computing platforms to help build the next generation of humanoid robots.\n\nAdditionally, the company recently launched its new Blackwell platform, which can process trillion-parameter large language models at as much as 25 times less cost and energy than Nvidia's previous Hopper architecture.\n\nNvidia has executed nearly perfectly since the beginning of the generative AI era, and the company looks like a good bet to continue to dominate the market for AI hardware.\n\nWhile Microsoft and Apple both have their own strengths in AI, they don't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia does, and they haven't demonstrated the same ability to develop new AI technology.\n\nIf you're bullish on AI, Nvidia looks like the best stock of the three to own today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The market indexes pulled back last month, which also pulled Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) off its highs. Nvidia is one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year, with the shares currently up 116% year to date. But the further the stock climbs, the greater the expectations for the company's upcoming fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 28.\n\nWall Street is very bullish on Nvidia stock, and Morgan Stanley is the latest firm to weigh in. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley analysts maintained an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $144 price target, which would be a new all-time high and up 34% from the current price.\n\nNvidia is enjoying tremendous momentum in its data center business, but considering the volatility that can happen during earnings season, should investors buy before the company's upcoming earnings report?\n\nWill Nvidia meet high expectations?\n\nNvidia reported stellar numbers over the last year. In the fiscal first quarter ending in April, demand for the company's popular H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) drove its data center revenue up an astonishing 427% year over year.\n\nThe lucrative margins of these advanced chips led to a massive 629% year-over-year increase in Nvidia's earnings per share. These incredible numbers could support new highs for the stock in the near term. The forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 38 gives Nvidia a reasonable PEG ratio of 1.15 using the Wall Street consensus long-term earnings growth estimate of 33%. The rule of thumb is that growth stocks are undervalued if the P/E is less than the company's earnings growth rate.\n\nBut it might be smart to wait until after earnings to buy shares. The chip industry can experience slowdowns in growth that come unexpectedly. Moreover, Nvidia faces increasing competition from cloud service providers and other semiconductor companies that are making custom chips for artificial intelligence.\n\nIf Nvidia continues to report strong growth, it will provide more evidence of Nvidia's opportunity despite these risks, and given the stock's valuation, there would still be time to buy the stock ahead of more gains.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks That Can Plunge Up to 98%, According to Select Wall Street Pundits",
        "content": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) is currently the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street, the euphoria surrounding stock splits isn't too far behind.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. These changes are purely cosmetic in the sense that stock splits have no impact on a company's market cap or its underlying operating performance.\n\nStock splits can go in either direction: forward or reverse. With a reverse-stock split, a company is purposely increasing its share price. This is often done to meet the continued minimum listing standards for a major stock exchange. Meanwhile, a forward-stock split is undertaken to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for retail investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Since forward splits are completed from a position of strength, they tend to be the type of split investors gravitate to. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOver the last six months, 12 prominent companies have announced and/or completed a stock split, only one of which was of the reverse-split variety.\n\nWhile most Wall Street pundits (analysts, money managers, and economists) expect these one dozen stock-split stocks to head higher, this feeling of optimism isn't unanimous. Based on the prognostications of select Wall Street pundits, three stock-split stocks could plunge by as much as 98%!\n\nNvidia: Implied downside of 98%\n\nThe first stock-split stock that could absolutely crash through the floorboard, based on the forecast of one Wall Street figure, is the hardware kingpin of the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia completed its historic 10-for-1 forward split after the closing bell on June 7.\n\nFinancial writer, economist, and founder of HS Dent Investment Management, Harry Dent, told Fox News Digital in June that Wall Street may be facing a bigger bubble than what occurred during the Great Depression. Dent pointed to the length of the current bubble (14 years), and the government stimulus that's fueled this rally, as his reasoning why the benchmark S&P 500 could plunge 86% and Nvidia could collapse by 98%!\n\nWhile I don't share Dent's overly pessimistic forecast of a 98% decline for Nvidia, I am in agreement that the table is set for Wall Street's preeminent AI stock to fall off of the proverbial cliff sooner, rather than later.\n\nAlthough history doesn't repeat to a \"t\" on Wall Street, it does have a tendency to rhyme. Looking back 30 years, there hasn't been a hyped innovation, technology, or trend that's managed to avoid an early innings bubble. This is to say that every new technology needs time to mature; and investors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly this happens. With most businesses currently lacking a clear game plan for how they're going to deploy AI solutions and grow their bottom lines, it looks to be just a matter of time before the AI bubble pops.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be clear, I'm not suggesting that AI can't be a game-changer over the long run. Rather, I'm letting history do the talking for me and pointing out that it takes time for next-big-thing trends to find their footing.\n\nCompetition is going to be another problem. Even though Nvidia's AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) possess clear-cut compute advantages over its rivals, it's nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand. External competitors rolling out AI-GPUs shouldn't have any trouble grabbing market share from Nvidia.\n\nLikewise, Nvidia is liable to lose valuable data center space with its top customers developing AI chips of their own. Long story short, Nvidia's adjusted gross margin and GPU pricing power have likely peaked, which spells trouble for the company's stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy: Implied downside of 87%\n\nA second stock-split stock that has the potential to plummet, based on the price target on one Wall Street analyst, is AI-inspired enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). MicroStrategy's 10-for-1 forward split will become effective as of the close of trading on August 7.\n\nAlmost a year ago to today, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill reiterated an underperform rating and lowly $210 price target for MicroStrategy. With shares of the company now north of $1,600, Thill's forecast would imply a whopping 87% retracement.\n\nThough it's technically a software company, MicroStrategy is best-known for its leveraged bet on Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As of June 20, it held 226,331 Bitcoins, which works out to more than 1% of the 21 million tokens that'll ever be mined. With Bitcoin valued at $64,101 per token, as of this writing, MicroStrategy's crypto assets are worth about $14.5 billion.\n\nHerein lies the problem.\n\nMicroStrategy ended July with a market cap of almost $29 billion. Backing out its software business, which has seen sales decline by 14% over the last decade, investors are placing a valuation on its Bitcoin assets of between $27 billion and $28 billion. Instead of just purchasing Bitcoin for around $64,100 on a cryptocurrency exchange, investors are buying shares of MicroStrategy and paying closer to $120,000 per Bitcoin. This excessive valuation premium makes no sense.\n\nWorse yet, MicroStrategy has been financing its Bitcoin purchases with convertible-debt offerings. This strategy works great during crypto bull markets, but could very easily come back to haunt the company when digital currencies enter a steep bear market, which cryptocurrencies are known for.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that Bitcoin's network is inferior to other blockchain projects, in terms of processing speed and cost. With Bitcoin's first-mover advantages dissipating, MicroStrategy could easily lose its luster.\n\nCintas: Implied downside of 23%\n\nThe third stock-split stock that's poised to plunge, based on the price target forecast of one Wall Street pundit, is corporate identity uniforms provider Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS). Cintas is on track to complete a 4-for-1 forward split on September 11.\n\nWall Street's primary Cintas bear is Citigroup analyst Leo Carrington. Carrington has a sell rating on the company, to go along with a $590 price target, which implies 23% downside from where shares ended on July 31.\n\nThough Carrington acknowledged in a research note that the company's increased use of technology has driven operating efficiencies, he and his firm believe Cintas is already more-than-fully valued.\n\nThe big concern for Cintas is that it's a cyclical business. Although economic expansions last considerably longer than recessions, certain factors suggest that a sizable downturn for the U.S. economy may be on the horizon. These factors include the first notable decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression, the longest yield-curve inversion in history, and one of the priciest valuations for the stock market, when back-tested to the early 1870s. If a recession were to arrive, companies with premium valuations would likely be the hardest hit.\n\nSpeaking of valuation, Cintas is currently trading at a multiple of nearly 46 times consensus earnings per share for fiscal 2025, which will end on May 31, 2025. Despite receiving a hearty boost from acquisitions and various operating efficiency improvements, an organic sales growth rate of 7.5% simply doesn't pass muster for a price-to-earnings multiple of almost 46.\n\nThe reason Cintas is unlikely to plunge as much as Nvidia or MicroStrategy is because of its hearty capital-return program. On July 23, Cintas announced a 15.6% increase to its quarterly cash dividend -- the 41st consecutive year Cintas has increased its payout -- as well as a $1 billion share repurchase program.\n\nUnlike Harry Dent's overly pessimistic price target for Nvidia, Leo Carrington's $590 bullseye for Cintas is reasonable given the company's lofty premium and the economic challenges that may lie ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Could Be Bad and Good News for Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been flying high for the past few years, buoyed by the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Its sales of chips and related products to AI customers have helped it report record earnings that have climbed in the triple digits. The company even launched a stock split back in June to lower its per-share price, a move to make it more easily accessible to a wider range of investors.\n\nBut, since the split, Nvidia's stock has disappointed investors, falling more than 11%. Now some are wondering whether Nvidia has permanently lost its momentum -- after all, the company is up against more and more competition in the AI chip market. On top of this, Nvidia may be facing delays in the release of its much-awaited Blackwell chip, according to a news report. The chip might be delayed by at least three months because of a design flaw, The Information reported.\n\nIf this is indeed the case, it may be bad news for Nvidia stock -- but there could be some positive news in this story too. Let's take a closer look at the situation and find out where Nvidia stock may be heading in the coming months. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe importance of Blackwell\n\nFirst, a quick summary of Nvidia's path so far and the importance of Blackwell. Today, Nvidia sells the H100, a graphics processing unit (GPU) that plays a crucial role in many key AI tasks, such as the training and inferencing of models. The H100, using the Hopper architecture, is today's top-performing chip, but Nvidia has something even more exciting on the horizon for AI customers: the Blackwell architecture and B200 AI chip. This technology could be a game-changer for those ramping up AI data centers, lowering cost and energy consumption and making gains in performance, security, and more.\n\nIn the most recent earnings report, Nvidia said Blackwell was in full production and the goals were production shipments to begin in the second quarter and data centers up and running in the fourth quarter. As a result, chief executive officer Jensen Huang said he expects \"a lot\" of revenue from the Blackwell platform this year.\n\nThis brings me to the latest news. Nvidia, this past week, told Microsoft and another major cloud customer about the delay, The Information reported, citing two people who help produce the chip. Reuters contacted Nvidia and received the following emailed response from a spokesperson: \"As we've stated before, Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, at this point, without a comment from Nvidia to confirm it, it's not clear whether the B200 will be delayed. If it is, and if Blackwell revenue is slower to get going than planned, this could weigh on investor sentiment and the stock in the coming months. That's the bad news for Nvidia and its shareholders.\n\nEnormous demand for Nvidia chips\n\nNow, here's the good news. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have ordered \"tens of billions of dollars worth of the chips,\" according to the article in The Information. This highlights the enormous demand for Nvidia's latest GPUs. Even in an environment where rivals have launched other high-performing chips and these three market giants are making their own AI chips, they still rely on Nvidia in a major way. This is a key point to note because one of investors' biggest concerns in recent times has been the idea that Nvidia could lose market share to competitors.\n\nOf course, you now might wonder if a possible delay will send these customers running to the competition -- at least for future chip needs. I don't think so, and here's why. Production delays and even product flaws aren't unheard of in technology (or any other business). Unless this sort of thing happens repeatedly or if a company is unable to fix the problem, it's unlikely this will hurt product demand.\n\nBig AI customers are eager to get their hands on the world's best chip -- even if they have to wait a bit longer than expected for it.\n\nAll of this means that, if the Blackwell chip delay is true, Nvidia shares could suffer in the short term, but if Nvidia handles the problem in an efficient manner and customers are satisfied with the chip, this shouldn't matter much over the long run. The good news is demand is strong for the company's products -- with the world's biggest tech companies spending billions of dollars on them -- and that could drive Nvidia's earnings and the stock price significantly higher over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Chipmakers crushed on US recession concerns",
        "content": "Shares in chipmakers plummeted significantly on Monday amid a global market sell-off, with Japanese stocks plunging by more than 12% due to growing concerns over a potential U.S. recession.\n\nThe fears spurred investors to flee from riskier assets, betting that a series of swift rate cuts might be necessary to support economic growth.\n\nSafe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw substantial gains as investors unwound crowded carry trades, leading to speculation that some were selling profitable positions to cover losses elsewhere. The intensity of the sell-off triggered circuit breakers across Asian exchanges.\n\nSemiconductor stocks, many of which enjoyed substantial gains in recent years driven by the AI boom, fell sharply in premarket trading Monday. The AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was down 9% at the time of writing, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged 5%, 4% and 4.6%.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 6.5%, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) tumbled 7.6%, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) dipped 5%.\n\nBut the sell-off extends much beyond chipmakers, with Nasdaq 100 Futures futures tumbling 4.7%, and S&P 500 futures falling 2.8%, reflecting the global nature of the market turmoil.\n\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures declined 2.1%, while FTSE futures slipped 1.2%. Japan's Nikkei dropped a staggering 12.4%, reaching seven-month lows, a level of decline not seen since the 2011 financial crisis.\n\nThe MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 4.2%. Chinese blue chips, however, were relatively resilient, dipping only 0.5%, helped by a rise in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.\n\nJapanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply by 17 basis points to 0.788%, the lowest since April, as markets re-evaluated the likelihood of another rate hike from the Bank of Japan.\n\nU.S. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with United States 10-Year dropping to 3.767%, the lowest since mid-2023. United States 2-Year decreased to 3.818%, and the yield curve could soon invert, a pattern historically associated with recessions.\n\nThe weak July payrolls report has led markets to price in a 78% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September by a full 50 basis points. Futures suggest a total of 122 basis points in cuts for the year, with rates expected to be around 3.0% by the end of 2025.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note, adding that the risk is somewhat mitigated by the Fed's ability to ease policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street bank now anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December.\n\n\"The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks. If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September,” analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan was more pessimistic, assigning a 50% probability of a U.S. recession.\n\n\"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November,\" said the bank’s economists.\n\nThe significant drop in Treasury yields has overshadowed the U.S. dollar's typical safe-haven appeal, dragging the currency down 1.1% against a basket of major currencies. The dollar fell 2% against the yen to 143.10, while the euro dropped 1.9% to 156.35 yen. However, the euro held steady against the dollar at $1.0934.\n\nInvestors also increased bets that other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease policy more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now expected to cut rates by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nIn the commodity markets, gold traded relatively flat at $2,431.62.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmakers crushed on US recession concerns\n\nStocks trampled, Nikkei tumbles past Black Monday milestone\n\nEuropean stocks plunge on recession fears\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks I'm Buying On the Dip",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit a speed bump. On June 25, 2024, Goldman Sachs released a thought-provoking research report titled \"Gen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?\" This analysis sent ripples through the tech sector, causing many AI-centric stocks to stumble.\n\nGoldman's report paints a sobering picture of AI's near-term economic impact. It suggests that building out AI infrastructure could cost a staggering $1 trillion. More concerningly, the report argues that AI's cost-saving potential may not justify this enormous price tag. It also raises concerns about looming energy constraints potentially limiting AI's ability to boost top-line growth outside the chipmaking industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors, already jittery from a slowing economy and geopolitical tensions, seemed to take these arguments to heart. The result? A significant pullback in many of the market's most prominent AI players.\n\nA buying opportunity\n\nWhile Goldman's analysis raises valid points, I believe it may be overly focused on short-term hurdles. AI isn't going to revolutionize the world overnight, but its transformative potential is undeniable. We're witnessing the early stages of a technological shift that will reshape industries, boost productivity, and create entirely new business models.\n\nConsider this: AI is currently in its infancy. The advances we'll see in the next two to three years will likely make today's AI look primitive by comparison. I'm convinced we're on the cusp of seeing the emergence of true \"killer apps\" -- AI-powered innovations that drive widespread adoption and showcase the technology's game-changing capabilities.\n\nMoreover, once AI becomes deeply integrated into popular ecosystems like Apple's, we'll likely see a quantum leap in public awareness and appreciation of AI's potential. This near-term event could trigger a new wave of investment and innovation across the tech sector.\n\nWith this long-term perspective in mind, I see the current dip in AI stocks as a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors. Two companies in particular stand out as attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the AI revolution: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why.\n\nNvidia: The AI Powerhouse\n\nNvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has seen its share price drop by nearly 15% since Goldman's report. This double-digit pullback presents an intriguing entry point for a company that's absolutely dominating the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the de facto standard for AI processing, powering everything from autonomous vehicles to large language models. The company's recent financial results underscore this fact. In fiscal 2024, Nvidia reported a staggering 126% year-over-year jump in revenue and an equally impressive gross margin of 73%.\n\nWhat excites me most about Nvidia, though, is its relentless innovation. Its next AI GPU, Blackwell, showcases the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of this game-changing tech. Given its outsize market share and focus on innovation, Nvidia is in a prime position to benefit from an AI-powered future.\n\nAmazon: AI woven into its DNA\n\nE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon has also felt the impact of Goldman's report, with its stock shedding 10% of its value. However, I see this as a chance to invest in a company that's integrating AI across its vast business empire.\n\nAmazon's AI strategy is multifaceted. In e-commerce, AI powers everything from product recommendations to inventory management and logistics optimization. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a comprehensive suite of AI and machine learning tools, enabling businesses of all sizes to harness the power of AI.\n\nWhile Amazon's recent growth hasn't been as explosive as Nvidia's, it's still noteworthy. Wall Street is expecting a 22% rise in sales over the course of 2024 and 2025 for the e-commerce titan. Consistent double-digit revenue growth is an impressive achievement, especially for a megacap company like Amazon.\n\nThe bottom line is that Amazon's massive data resources and cloud infrastructure give it a significant edge in developing and deploying AI solutions at scale.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nThe current market skepticism around AI, as reflected in Goldman's report, may be overlooking the technology's long-term transformative potential. Both Nvidia and Amazon are exceptionally well positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI revolution, regardless of short-term cost concerns or economic headwinds.\n\nNvidia's innovation engine and market dominance in AI chips make it a cornerstone of the AI ecosystem. Amazon's diverse AI strategy, spanning e-commerce, cloud services, and consumer devices, provides multiple avenues for growth and value creation. So, despite the ongoing volatility in these names, I plan to start buying them aggressively over the next two years.\n\nHowever, if you want exposure to this theme without buying individual stocks, there are several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available that focus on AI and machine learning. Most of these ETFs own a significant number of Nvidia and Amazon shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "AI market darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has cooled off, dropping roughly 15% since peaking at a $3.3 trillion market cap just a few weeks ago. Despite the recent stumble, the stock has gained over 100% over the past year. Volatility is normal for any stock that rises so much in a short amount of time.\n\nBut Nvidia's current dip isn't an automatic buying opportunity. Question marks are starting to pile up as the company prepares to announce second-quarter earnings in a few weeks.\n\nHere are the risks investors should consider before buying the stock today.\n\nIs Nvidia's market share under attack?\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) race began in early 2023 with the viral arrival of ChatGPT. Nvidia's GPUs, which can optimize for AI applications using proprietary software, quickly established a dominant market share. Industry estimates have pegged Nvidia's AI market share as high as 70% to 95%. Research from TechInsights estimates Nvidia accounted for 98% of total data center GPU revenue in 2023.\n\nNvidia's financials back that up; revenue growth accelerated to nearly 300%. Technology CEOs like Elon Musk openly pleaded they couldn't get Nvidia's chips fast enough. Such high demand has done wonders for Nvidia's pricing power, too. Gross profit margins have expanded significantly to over 75%: NVDA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nBut it's hard staying on top when everyone is coming for your crown, and many of these big chip spenders may not enjoy being at Nvidia's mercy. It's known that competitors like Intel and AMD are pushing alternatives, and big technology companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are building custom AI chips.\n\nAlphabet may have struck the first known blow to Nvidia's dominance. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently disclosed that it used 2,048 of Alphabet's TPU v5p chips to build the AI that will run on iOS devices. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPU v4 processors. These tensor processing units (TPUs) are purpose-built to train AI models. Apple didn't say it didn't use Nvidia chips, but omitted Nvidia when describing its hardware and software build.\n\nHeading into earnings with sky-high expectations\n\nApple's tie-up with Alphabet is significant for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, Apple's AI project is critically important, and the company chose Alphabet's chips despite the perception that Nvidia was the de facto industry leader and go-to chip vendor. It's just one instance, but it's now fair to question whether Nvidia's AI moat is as wide as initially thought.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, analysts' revenue estimates remain very optimistic despite potential competitive pressure. You can see that estimates for 2024 and 2025 are as high as ever: NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThird, genuine competitive pressures would likely threaten Nvidia's gross profit margins, which (as you saw in the first chart) have expanded beyond 75%. Over the past five years, Nvidia's gross margins have averaged 63%. Even if Nvidia retains the lion's share of the AI chip market, it may no longer do so at any price. Prices may have to come down to compete.\n\nHow should investors approach Nvidia today?\n\nThe potential downside in both revenue and gross margins should concern investors. I'm not saying that Nvidia can't or won't remain the leading AI chip company. But it's becoming increasingly plausible that deep-pocketed competitors can win business. Many of these big technology companies building custom AI chips are currently Nvidia's largest customers!\n\nMaybe the broader demand for AI chips will be so great that Nvidia can grow while ceding some of its market share. The risk is that it can't, that Nvidia's AI revenue could peak and then moderate or even decline as other AI chips flood the market. Q2 earnings could easily be another blowout quarter. Investors will want to pay close attention to management's full-year guidance, which should reveal future sales momentum.\n\nNvidia could prove volatile as Wall Street chews on these questions. Investors may want to consider waiting to see how Q2 earnings look before aggressively buying shares. At the very least, consider dollar-cost averaging your Nvidia investments. That's a smart way to manage uncertain markets or falling stock prices. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can lower your average cost per share over time. This method helps you buy more when prices are low, offering a strategic advantage in volatile markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why now is the time to buy the Nvidia sell-off",
        "content": "Nvidia’s (NVDA) “relief rally” on Wednesday was short-lived. The stock hit its lowest level since May, falling as much as 7% on Friday and wiping out its gains from earlier in the week amid a broader unraveling across the tech sector.\n\nThe Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory, driven not only by signs of a slowing economy but also by fears that a handful of tech’s biggest players are overspending on AI.\n\nBut that latter factor — a pledge to invest more in AI — should be viewed as a “catalyst” for Nvidia and other AI chipmakers.\n\nWall Street pros were quick to tell Yahoo Finance this week that the AI trade is far from over, and the recent pullback should be viewed as a chance to scoop up shares. While the Big Tech companies are struggling to show the fruits of their AI labor, they're still committed to spending on chips for the long term.\n\n“It's a good buying opportunity given the prospects of the broader market,” Winthrop Capital Management’s Luke Stone told me following Nvidia competitor AMD’s (AMD) strong revenue forecast.\n\n“You’re seeing this delineation between the chip manufacturers and their customers, who have to invest more and more into the product and are really struggling,” Winthrop added.\n\nJust this past quarter, Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) posted more than $40 billion in expenditures. Amazon (AMZN) totaled $30 billion in spending during the first six months of the year and plans to spend even more in the second half. All have said the majority of that money is going toward AI.\n\nThat’s not what the market wanted to hear. Shares of Amazon and Microsoft closed the week lower, similar to the drop in Alphabet shares last week, as investors made it clear the AI trade has turned into a show-me story.\n\nBut what’s worrisome for hyperscalers is good news for Nvidia and its peers.\n\n“We've continued to see the [capital expenditures] guides actually go up materially and that's really what's important,” Bernstein managing director Stacy Rasgon told me. “People worry about sustainability but it looks like that spend, at least for now, is sustaining.”\n\nAnd that’s set to boost Nvidia’s top line, as Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft account for more than 40% of the chipmaker’s revenue.\n\n“Fear that the revenue trajectory won’t be there over the next 12 months or so is now starting to ease,” CFRA’s Angelo Zino explained to me. “We think Nvidia is going to post some great results, and that is going to be a catalyst for the space.”\n\nIn a note to clients earlier this week, Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore argued the sell-off in Nvidia presents a “good entry point” and moved the chipmaker back to its \"Top Pick.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n“Our perception is that the market is taking a very glass half-empty view of some of the hyperscale comments, where there is a clear desire on the part of customers to continue to commit resources to developing multi modal generative AI,” Moore wrote.\n\nSynovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan likened the opportunity to invest in Nvidia and other AI infrastructure stocks to suppliers who thrived during the gold rush. “Would you rather be the person who's digging gold or would you rather be the person that's selling the equipment to dig for gold?” he said.\n\nNvidia closed the week off 5% and down roughly 26% from its record closing high. Despite the pullback, shares are still up 116% year to date.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

        "title": "Hold Up! Why You Should Wait for Dell Stock to Dip Below $100 Before Buying",
        "content": "Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has cemented its status as a leading force in the technology sector with its IT hardware, software, and services. However, the past year has proven to be a rollercoaster ride for Dell’s stock price.\n\nAfter hitting a low of $52.05 in early August 2023, DELL surged to a high of $179.70 by May 29, 2024. However, disappointing first-quarter earnings triggered a substantial decline in the stock price. Presently, it is trading around $108. Despite this drop, DELL stock boasts a whopping 40% return since January. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 advanced 13% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nDespite short-term challenges, Dell still remains an intriguing prospect for long-term investors. However, from a technical standpoint, a potential near-term correction toward its 50-day moving average (MA) might offer a more enticing entry point for investors. Given the current market conditions and Dell’s recent performance, it is crucial to evaluate whether now is the opportune time to invest. Therefore, based on the current landscape, we suggest holding off buying Dell stock for the time being.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNavigating Challenges and Addressing Profitability Concerns  Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies operates through two key segments: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) and the Client Solutions Group (CSG). ISG, which includes servers, storage, and cloud services, remains central to Dell’s business and benefits from digital transformation trends. In contrast, CSG, which covers PCs and client devices, struggles with reduced consumer demand and increased competition.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Dell reported $22.2 billion in revenue, marking a 6% year-over-year (YOY) increase. However, operating income fell 14% YOY to $920 million, and adjusted diluted EPS decreased by 3% to $1.27. Despite a strong performance in artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized servers, with the backlog growing over 30% to $3.8 billion, concerns about profitability and a lack of forward guidance have impacted investor confidence.\n\nLooking ahead, through strategic partnerships with Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Dell aims to enhance its position in telecom infrastructure and hyper-converged solutions. Moreover, the company’s commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends should be noted.\n\nDespite these efforts, recent financial results suggest a cautious outlook during the current volatility on Wall Street. Although DELL stock is potentially a robust investment for long-term investors, at this point, they should wait for a more favorable entry point.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow AI May Impact Dell Stock AI text on smartphone against background of green stock chart. Profit growth, share price, business success, investment and trading in artificial intelligence concept. AI stocks to buy\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe AI market is expected to grow, from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030. This reflects a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 35%. Dell’s focus on AI and innovation, including its involvement in Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) upcoming Blackwell chip and Elon Musk’s new xAI data center in Austin, positions it well for future growth. However, investors expect the company to address concerns over income and profitability levels.\n\nIf you are an investor who looks at charts for technical analysis, you may note the short-term bearish momentum in Dell stock. Its price has diverged significantly from the 50-day moving average (MA) of about $137. The next test for Dell shares would likely be the 200-day MA of about $104. Given the current bearish sentiment around tech stocks, we expect Dell stock to decline toward $100, or even below.\n\nFinally, the stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.8x and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.9x are slightly higher than peers. In other words, investors will scrutinize the next earnings by Dell’s management to see if the current valuation levels can be justified.\n\nConsidering these factors, we believe the short-term instability on Wall Street warrants caution. Investors should monitor Dell’s financial performance and market conditions while considering the potential for future growth driven by AI and cloud computing.\n\nPrudent Now: Consider Buying on Dips Hand holding a smartphone with the text of buy the dip in, stock market correction. \"It's dip o'clock!\" famous sentence. Economics, Stock Market, Stock Exchange, Background. 3D illustration.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies remains a formidable force in the tech industry with promising long-term prospects. The company’s strategic investments in AI and cloud computing provide a solid foundation for future growth. The potential inclusion of Dell in the S&P 500 index could further enhance its appeal.\n\nHowever, the current investment climate and the stock’s recent performance suggest that holding Dell stock is the most prudent course of action. Looking at a technical chart, we expect an initial decline towards the $100 level. This could be followed by a period of consolidation within a $90-$110 trading range, to set up a rally to go towards $150. For current investors, maintaining positions while staying informed about Dell’s progress and market developments is advisable.\n\nDell could offer more attractive opportunities once a clearer margin of safety is established. Finally, analysts’ long-term sentiment remains positive, with a 12-month median price forecast of $160.26, indicating 48% potential upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the year's story on Wall Street. Case in point: Five of the six top-performing stocks year to date in the Nasdaq 100 are connected to the AI sector.\n\nYet investors looking for an outstanding AI stock should consider something other than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Indeed, many billionaires are already buying a different AI stock hand over fist: Oracle (NYSE: ORCL).\n\nHere's what's happening and why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThese billionaires can't get enough of Oracle\n\nThanks to SEC filings, the public can track sizable stock purchases made by individuals or hedge funds each quarter. As of this writing, the most recent filings occurred in mid-May and reflect positions held as of March 31, 2024.\n\nDuring the first quarter this year, several billionaires (or their respective hedge funds) increased their positions in Oracle:\n\nBillionaire Hedge Fund Shares Added Percentage Increase in Shares Value of Shares Held David Shaw D.E. Shaw 3,340,000 345% $541,000,000 David Tepper Appaloosa 975,000 74% $289,000,000 Ken Griffin Citadel Advisors 382,000 51% $143,000,000 Paul Tudor Jones Tudor Investments 24,000 59% $8,000,000 Ray Dalio Bridgewater 2,000 64% $1,000,000\n\nAs noted in the table, David Shaw, founder of the investment management firm D.E. Shaw, added the most shares, more than tripling his total holdings to more than $500 million worth of Oracle stock.  Similarly, David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management, added nearly a million shares of Oracle during the first quarter, bringing his total holdings in the company to 2.3 million shares -- worth roughly $290 million.  Many other billionaires, including Ken Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones, and Ray Dalio, also increased their holdings of Oracle.\n\nThis is why billionaires are so bullish on Oracle\n\nSo why is it that many of the world's richest people are buying Oracle stock hand over fist? The answer lies in one of the hottest trends around: artificial intelligence.\n\nThat's because developing and running cutting-edge AI applications requires massive computing power and data storage -- the sort that few organizations have. For the AI models to function correctly, organizations must train them using gigantic data sets encompassing everything from ancient history to pop culture to theoretical physics. The only way to accomplish this is to link hundreds of thousands of advanced semiconductors together in a data center.\n\nMany companies operating these data centers already boast market caps well over $1 trillion: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and MetaPlatforms. But Oracle does not. With a market cap of less than $400 billion, Oracle is America's 19th-largest company, but its market cap is still only 12% of Microsoft's.\n\nStory continues MSFT Market Cap Chart\n\nGranted, Oracle's data center business is much smaller. According to one estimate, the company controls roughly 2% of the global cloud services market, compared to 31% for Amazon and 25% for Microsoft. However, the reason billionaires are showing such interest in Oracle is the company's rapid growth in its cloud business. It's growing like a weed, and it is poised to support the skyrocketing demand for cloud services and AI.\n\nFor example, following the release of the company's latest quarterly results (for the three months ending on May 31, 2024), Oracle CEO Safra Catz noted that the company had reached \"a tipping point\" and that the most recent quarter marks the \"full emergence of [Oracle's] high-growth cloud business.\" Later in the call, Catz revealed that ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has decided to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. In addition, Catz said that Google Cloud has partnered with Oracle to facilitate direct access to Oracle Database services for Google Cloud customers by September.\n\nThe addition of new customers is encouraging for potential investors, as it demonstrates the company is executing a successful pivot toward higher-growth segments like cloud computing, machine learning, and AI. This change in strategy offers Oracle a chance to boost its revenue and increase its profits, making its stock more attractive to long-term investors.\n\nIn summary, Oracle is ramping up its efforts to support the rapidly expanding cloud services and AI market. Billionaires have taken notice and are piling into the stock. Investors looking for an under-the-radar AI play should take notice -- Oracle is once again a stock worth considering.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "'She came to my wedding': Kamala Harris tech ties complicate Trump's effort to win over Silicon Valley",
        "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris has immediately complicated Republican efforts to win over Silicon Valley converts.\n\nDonald Trump tallied millions in donations from tech-world figures in recent months. But Democrats have long held an advantage there and the new presumptive Democratic nominee has especially deep connections to this community and its pocketbooks.\n\nHow this plays out in the months ahead could make things, at the very least, awkward, even for some of Trump's most ardent supporters.\n\n\"She came to my wedding,\" said Trevor Traina, one of the tech world leading the charge for Trump in a recent interview. He is the founder and chairman of digital wallet app Kresus Labs and was ambassador to Austria under Trump.\n\nTraina helped organize a recent high-profile Silicon Valley fundraiser for the former president at the home of billionaire David Sacks that raised $12 million.\n\nHis support for Trump isn't wavering, he said, but he also declined to criticize Harris personally in the recent conversation.\n\n\"Kamala is a dear friend of mine, and I like her very much,\" he said before adding, \"It's just that in today's world, candidates who want to be successful on the left have to toe the line on the whole Elizabeth Warren school of thought.\" Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two in Indianapolis on July 24. (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI via Getty Images)\n\nOthers say a change is afoot inside the center of the tech universe as Harris has quickly consolidated the public support of existing Democratic mega-donors and a new open letter from \"VCs for Kamala\" has over 400 signatures.\n\nHer campaign also raised over $200 million in national grassroots donations in her first week of the race.\n\n\"The change from Biden to Harris has absolutely shifted the environment in Silicon Valley,\" said Box CEO Aaron Levie in a recent post on X.\n\nThe well-known Democratic donor added that some \"were on the sidelines or wouldn't have been all that energized, but that has changed now.\"\n\nAnother indication of possible Harris momentum in Silicon Valley was a reader survey by the Information that found a jump in tech-world support for Harris.\n\nHarris's ties to Silicon Valley even extend to the familial.\n\nHer niece is Meena Harris, who used to work at Uber (UBER) and wrote a children's book about her aunt. She's married to Nikolas Ajagu, who, according to Linkedin, was formerly an executive at Facebook (META).\n\nA counteroffensive from Trump and his allies\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is clearly not going to cede any gained ground without a fight.\n\nOn Monday, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance visited Palo Alto for a sold-out fundraiser, according to an invitation posted online.\n\nStory continues\n\nVance boasts his own bevy of Silicon Valley contacts from a stint as a San Francisco venture capitalist and was back in the region for a fundraising lunch in the nearby town of Coalinga on Wednesday. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) pays for a breakfast order on July 28 during a stop in St Cloud, Minn. (Stephen Maturen/Getty Images) (Stephen Maturen via Getty Images)\n\nHarmeet Dhillon is a California lawyer and the former vice chairwoman of the California Republican Party who shared this week's invitation. Like many in the area, she crossed paths with Harris, once representing opposite sides in litigation.\n\nShe said in a recent interview that Harris's potential to shake up this aspect of the race is being overblown.\n\n\"She lives in Silicon Valley, but ... she's not part of the tech community,\" Dhillon said of Harris, arguing \"no one's authentically a cheerleader for Kamala Harris other than her immediate family members.\"\n\nDhillon also strongly disputes the notion that Harris could be friendlier to Big Tech than Biden. She is most focused on the Harris record when it comes to other issues like crime, which she said could be more determinative among the safety-conscious tech community.\n\nAnd Vance's selection has also already led to a thaw of sorts between the Trump campaign and one key tech billionaire: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.\n\nVance used to work for Thiel and the billionaire, in a recent New York Times interview, signaled new warmth for Trump while also remaining noncommittal about jumping into the 2024 race financially.\n\nThe Harris tech agenda\n\nA possible tech agenda for Harris, if she wins this fall, is also being looked at closely.\n\nHarris rose to national prominence in San Francisco and was known during her time in California for having a modestly collegial relationship with Big Tech. Donations from some of Silicon Valley's most prominent figures and their employees fueled her early runs for office, especially her 2016 Senate victory.\n\nAnd during her time as California attorney general, Harris often looked at tech issues but ended up focused on voluntary agreements with companies as she sought their cooperation on issues like sex trafficking online. Then Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg appeared with then California Attorney General Kamala Harris at a \"Safer Internet\" event at Facebook headquarters in 2015 in Menlo Park, Calif. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nEven during her 2020 presidential race, when Harris veered left on a variety of issues, she declined to call for the breakup of Big Tech as her rivals, Sens. Warren and Bernie Sanders, did. She focused on regulating the giants around issues like online privacy.\n\nHarris has focused on AI during her years as vice president and offered a similar approach focused on largely voluntary agreements as Washington begins to grapple with the technology.\n\nIn a speech in London last November, Harris called out companies and accused some of choosing profit over safety.\n\nBut at the same time, she often courted AI business leaders and convened CEOs to discuss the issues. This helped shepherd a wave of voluntary business-world commitments to some of the plans from top companies like Adobe (ADBE), IBM (IBM), and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nHarris has offered little in the way of public commentary on tech issues since entering the race but is expected to tout Biden accomplishments popular in tech circles like the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which is sending billions to semiconductor companies.\n\nA focus on those issues could be amplified further if Sen. Mark Kelly is picked as VP. Kelly has made the semiconductor efforts a centerpiece of his time in the Senate and helped shepherd much of the money to the swing state of Arizona that he represents. Kamala Harris poses with officials including officials from Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Meta, as well as Sam Altman of OpenAI on the second day of the UK AI Safety Summit in November 2023 in Bletchley, England. (Leon Neal/Getty Images) (Leon Neal via Getty Images)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is set to keep focused on the mashup of vocal tech-world venture capital figures and crypto libertarians he has assembled behind his candidacy.\n\n\"You are going to be very happy with me,\" Trump told an audience of bitcoin enthusiasts last weekend, arguing that across tech issues like cryptocurrency and AI \"we understand it, they don't understand it.\"\n\nAs for Traina, he expects that many of Trump's inroads in Silicon Valley will be durable as Trump-leaning technology figures are increasingly comfortable speaking out.\n\nThat going to continue to allow Trump, he says, to access a \"silent majority [in Silicon Valley] that was at the very least centrist, if not slightly right of center, but who were apolitical.\"\n\nTraina himself has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump and to other Republican candidates in 2024. But in yet another example of the complex equation in Silicon Valley at the moment, Traina himself had a very small role in the political rise of his former wedding guest.\n\nAccording to election records, he sent Kamala Harris a $1,500 check back in 2015.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Better Tech Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been battered and beaten over the last month, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 13%. There's not one specific reason for the sell-off, but rather several different ones. Better-than-expected inflation reports at the start of July triggered a slight reshuffle on Wall Street, allowing investors to pull back from the reliability of tech and look into less stable investments.\n\nThen, midway through the month, the Biden administration proposed more stringent sanctions on chip exports to China. Combined with the start of earnings season at the end of July, many tech stocks slid in recent weeks.\n\nWhile a market dip can be worrying, it also presents many buying opportunities. The tech industry remains one of the best places to invest for the long term, fueled by innovative companies that never cease to push the envelope. Meanwhile, a sell-off generally means better-priced stocks.\n\nTwo attractive long-term options are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), with one leading the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and the other home to a booming cloud business. Either of these companies' stocks would likely be real assets for any portfolio over the long term.\n\nSo, let's compare these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is the better stock this year.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's stock took a hard tumble over the last 30 days, falling 12%. The dip hasn't been great for current stockholders, but it has made the shares more accessible to new ones thanks to an improved valuation.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at one of its lowest levels in months, at about 62. That's high for a P/E and doesn't usually represent a bargain, but it's significantly lower than Nvidia's five-year average P/E of 80.\n\nThat average saw Nvidia's stock rise more than 2,500% since 2019, suggesting its current position is unlikely to stop it from delivering major gains in the coming years.\n\nMeanwhile, the company maintains a solid long-term outlook. Nvidia will post its 2025 second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28, an even that will likely boosting its share price. It beat Wall Street estimates for four consecutive quarters, and this quarter will likely follow suit.\n\nNvidia's chip rival Advanced Micro Devices reported second-quarter 2024 earnings this week. Revenue outperformed forecasts by $12 million as sales in its AI-focused data center segment surged 115% year over year. Considering Nvidia dominates the AI chip industry with an estimated 70% to 95% market share, it could be in for another quarter of beating expectations based on AMD's performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nA recent stock slump and an upcoming earnings release could be an excellent time to buy Nvidia before it's too late.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet is another exciting way to invest in tech. While Nvidia dominates hardware, Alphabet has reached historic heights with the popularity of its software. Its Android, Chrome, YouTube, and Google have made the company a household name and a thoroughly reliable growth stock.\n\nAlphabet's shares have risen 178% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's 82% rise. The company won over investors with consistent reinvestment in itself and financial growth.\n\nThe tech giant reported its second-quarter earnings last week, beating expectations in multiple areas. Earnings per share came in at $1.89 versus the $1.84 forecast. Net sales rose 14% year over year, landing $450 million above estimates. The quarter was the first time Google Cloud surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue and delivered over $1 billion in operating profit.\n\nThe company slightly missed on YouTube ad revenue, posting $8.7 billion against expectations of $8.9 billion. But sales in the segment still rose 13% year over year, rounding out an overall positive quarter for Alphabet.\n\nThe second quarter illustrated that Alphabet's advertising division remains a highly profitable business, alongside solid prospects in AI.\n\nIs Nvidia or Alphabet the better tech stock in 2024?\n\nBoth companies are among the most prominent names in tech, but Nvidia and Alphabet are otherwise challenging to compare. Their businesses operate in vastly different areas of the industry. Nvidia predominantly sells its chips to businesses, with part of its sales tied to the consumer market. Meanwhile, Alphabet's core business is digital advertising, and it is making impressive headway in cloud computing.\n\nHowever, these companies do complement each other. Alphabet requires graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's to run and expand its cloud services. And Nvidia's business is thriving by selling its chips to companies like Alphabet.\n\nAs a result, it's worth comparing their valuations to determine which is the better buy. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\nAlphabet's stock is currently a far better value than Nvidia's, with a significantly lower P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These metrics help determine a stock's value, and the lower the figure, the bigger the bargain.\n\nAs a result, Alphabet's stock is likely a lower-risk investment for now. With a lucrative ad business and expanding role in AI, it's worth picking up over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "AI chip leader and stock market darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has rapidly shed over 20% since becoming the world's most valuable company just weeks ago. Investors should think twice before rushing to buy the dip. Nvidia's stock appreciated to breathtaking heights and the company's once-presumed dominance of the AI chip market is now less certain.\n\nNvidia enjoyed rampant growth these past 18 months but relied on a small handful of customers for it.\n\nNews recently came that tech giant Apple, which will soon roll out AI tech for iOS devices, trained its AI models on Alphabet's AI chips instead of Nvidia's. It's a crack in the idea that Nvidia, which owned as much as 90% of the AI chip market, would continue to dominate without meaningful pressure from competition.\n\nInvestors may be better off letting more air out of Nvidia and circling back after its upcoming Q2 earnings give a glimpse into the business's performance.\n\nInstead, consider these two high-quality companies using AI to enhance their existing products. Their growth comes at solid prices, setting the stage for great long-term investment returns.\n\nThis software juggernaut offers growth at a reasonable price.\n\nSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) is no stranger to the technology sector. The company was a pioneer in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model. It sells the world's leading customer relationship manager (CRM) software but has vastly expanded over the years to form a software ecosystem packed with tools for running virtually all aspects of a company. Salesforce has been public since 2004 but remains a growing company today; the company's business segments, sales, service, platform/other, and integration/analytics all posted double-digit year-over-year growth in Q1.\n\nOver 150,000 companies use Salesforce worldwide, rich soil for growth via product cross-selling. Today, most revenue growth comes from expanding business with existing customers. As companies use more Salesforce products, it makes it harder to switch. Salesforce isn't an AI-driven business, but it uses AI to enhance its products. The company launched its Einstein 1 Platform, an AI product that enables customers to use AI across Salesforce's software ecosystem. Einstein can automate processes, deploy generative AI features, analyze and streamline data, and more. Ideally, Einstein will maximize the experience using Salesforce software, which ultimately makes customers less likely to leave and more likely to spend more.\n\nThere are signs that Salesforce is a maturing company; management began share repurchases a couple of years ago and initiated a dividend earlier this year. That signals to Wall Street that Salesforce makes more profits than it needs and can't think of a better way to spend them than simply returning them to shareholders. Analysts have also lowered their long-term earnings growth estimates over the past year:\n\nStory continues CRM EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAlthough the stock doesn't look as cheap, given lowered growth expectations, its PEG ratio of 1.4 is still reasonable for long-term investors. Anticipation is building for interest rate cuts, which could plant seeds for increased growth in the technology sector over the coming years. Salesforce could realistically outperform current expectations, making the stock look cheap in hindsight. When it comes to proven winners like Salesforce, it can pay not to get too cute.\n\nThis AI stock is a stand-out rebound candidate.\n\nUiPath(NYSE: PATH) has taken its lumps. The stock has fallen 85% from its former high, and its most recent quarter was disastrous, with the CEO abruptly resigning. Co-founder and former CEO Daniel Dines has reassumed the role for now. UiPath specializes in business automation software that learns and replicates repetitive computer tasks. It's the type of story about machines replacing humans you don't see in the movies. UiPath's technology has routinely garnished leadership status from third-party testing like Gartner's prestigious Magic Quadrant system.\n\nHowever, UiPath is clearly experiencing some challenges. The company's Q1 earnings included layoff announcements and a scaling back of its annual recurring revenue guidance from $1.725 billion to $1.730 to $1.660 billion to $1.665 for its fiscal year 2025. Management cited several excuses, including economic conditions, deal scrutiny, and the leadership change. It smells like the company didn't execute well under CEO Rob Enslin, who had been Co-CEO since 2022 but the sole CEO for only a few months.\n\nDaniel Dines has served in the CEO/Co-CEO role since 2005, so his return has seemingly restored analysts' confidence. Long-term earnings growth estimates plummeted after Q1 but have virtually rebounded to where they were entering the year: PATH EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nHowever, the stock has not come back. Today shares trade at a forward P/E ratio of 32, which would make it a jaw-dropping bargain if UiPath delivers earnings growth on par with estimates. Annualized 40% earnings growth is a tall task, and UiPath must still prove it's back on track. But investors who believe in the former CEO's leadership could be staring at a rare buying opportunity today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Sell Before You Regret It",
        "content": "Market volatility has picked up significantly, with tech stocks (again) leading the entire market lower on Thursday, a day after recovering markedly from Wednesday’s losses. Indeed, it can be a rather stomach-churning experience to be invested in stock markets these days.\n\nWith stocks kicking off August with a steep plunge, many beginner investors may be scrambling to offload some free-falling tech names before the damage has a chance to worsen.\n\nThough I’m no advocate for selling based on fear and negative momentum, making subtle adjustments can make sense, especially if you just discovered you’re under-diversified and overexposed to a specific sector (like tech) or industry (semiconductors).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we’ll look at three growth stocks to sell if you want to rotate into value or can’t stand the latest volatility spike. Of course, it’s quite a stretch to say you’ll regret not selling the following names. That said, they still seem a tad overvalued right here, and with momentum reversing, perhaps lightening up is more prudent than doubling down.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt hurts to put Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock on a list of stocks to sell; it really does. But even the king of artificial intelligence (AI) chips needs to take a nap every so often. While NVDA stock will gain again, the rest of the second half could prove punishing for shares as the semiconductor trade begins breaking down in a big way.\n\nEventually, NVDA stock will be an excellent buy on weakness (perhaps it’s a great buy today for investors seeking growth for the next five years and beyond). But until the dust settles and Blackwell chips begin selling, Nvidia could be an absolute roller-coaster ride that could cause some investors to toss their cookies.\n\nGoing into next year, it’ll all be about Blackwell. And maybe by then, dip-buyers will be able to punch their ticket at below $100 per share.\n\nAdditionally, should the big chip spenders (think other Magnificent Seven members) start reining in on AI spending in the fourth quarter, Nvidia stock’s negative momentum could worsen considerably. With its 1.68 beta, NVDA shareholders should expect nothing less than a rocky ride between now and year-end.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has been driving through some tough terrain in recent years, and odds are, it’ll continue to do so for the rest of the year. The delay to the much-anticipated robotaxi event could cause some impatient traders to throw in the towel on shares as the recent post-quarter spike looks to get wiped out entirely.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, TSLA stock is off 22% from its 52-week high of almost $279 per share. With momentum accelerating to the downside, I’d much rather be in a lower beta (TSLA stock boasts a huge 2.31 beta, which entails significant market risk) name as the tech sell-off intensifies.\n\nWith yet another recall (1.8 million vehicles this time) over hood issues and a recent Seattle-area Tesla self-driving car crash to worry about, the stock has more than enough negative drivers that could bring it below $200 per share by robotaxi day.\n\nSome big-name analysts are concerned about valuation. Given negative headwinds and softened growth, the 58.5 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple still seems too steep.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another high-tech momentum play that’s been rolling over in recent weeks. At writing, AVGO stock is now down close to 20% from its recent all-time high after tumbling 8.5% on Thursday’s session. Undoubtedly, Broadcom, the business, is firing on all cylinders. But with tech and semis experiencing vicious action, perhaps it’s time to reconsider buying the recent dip.\n\nAt 24.5 times forward P/E, Broadcom shares aren’t really all too expensive. Additionally, its AI muscles seem to get stronger by the day, with the firm’s ASIC business likely to gain for many years to come. Like Nvidia, Broadcom’s latest sell-off will probably create a stellar entry point for longer-term thinkers.\n\nHowever, unless you’re prepared for more down days like the one we had on Thursday, AVGO stock looks more like a trim than a buy here. Even after falling into a bear market, the stock is up 167% in the past two years, making the decline look like a relatively small blip. While the name may not be overvalued, it’s certainly overheated and at risk of more pain if this tech wreck continues through August.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: This 1 Thing Will Be Nvidia's Biggest Growth Driver Yet",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings have already been climbing in the triple digits -- and that's led to mind-boggling stock performance. Shares of the technology giant have soared 2,500% over the past five years. And even though stock performance has slowed in recent weeks, the shares have still advanced about 120% since the start of this year.\n\nThe reason for this growth is simple: Nvidia has secured itself a major position in one of today's hottest growth markets: artificial intelligence (AI). The company holds 80% of the AI chip market thanks to the tremendous performance of its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips power key AI tasks, such as the training and inference of large language models (LLMs).\n\nNow, as other chip companies launch products to rival Nvidia's top chip, some investors wonder whether Nvidia's biggest wave of growth is over. But my prediction is that one thing in particular will be Nvidia's biggest growth driver yet -- and it's right around the corner. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia and AI\n\nFirst, a quick note on Nvidia's path to this point. Several years ago, the company was a giant in the video games market, with its GPUs bringing games to life on the screen for players. It became clear, though, that Nvidia's GPUs could be valuable across industries for many uses -- particularly AI. The tech company decided to focus on this high-growth industry, designing GPUs for those building AI platforms.\n\nAnd Nvidia didn't stop at GPUs. The company has designed a whole ecosystem of products and services for AI, making it the go-to provider for top chips and more. Market giants, such as Meta Platforms and Tesla, are major customers. In Tesla's recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said, \"I'm incredibly impressed by Nvidia's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that Nvidia's growth is far from over. But can it actually get even stronger? I think so, and what could spur this next era of even more growth is the company's upcoming release of the Blackwell architecture and chip.\n\nThe Blackwell architecture includes six transformative technologies, from being the most powerful chip yet to features offering higher security, reliability, and top performance in data analytics. In Nvidia's first-quarter earnings report, the company said Blackwell was in full production -- and the goal was to make it globally available later this year. At that point, similar to Elon Musk's recent words about Nvidia GPUs, the company said demand was surpassing supply. Nvidia expects this trend to continue next year, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Nvidia is constantly working to deliver its GPUs to those who need them, CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized the difficulty of addressing such a high need.\n\n\"A lot\" of Blackwell revenue\n\nAll of this suggests Nvidia's growth is far from over. And that Blackwell offers such improvements in performance -- for example, allowing companies to run generative AI on LLMs at as much as 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor -- signals growth could be set to take off. Nvidia's Huang says the company expects to see \"a lot\" of revenue from Blackwell this year.\n\nSo, what does this mean for investors? Nvidia shares aren't cheap, trading at 39 times forward earnings estimates, but considering Nvidia's track record and the upcoming Blackwell launch, this valuation is reasonable. Even if Nvidia shares don't soar immediately, it's clear there's a lot of gas in this tank to power gains over the long term.\n\nI predict that Blackwell will be the key to Nvidia's next era of massive growth -- and it's worth sticking around or getting in on the stock's recent dip to potentially benefit from this exciting story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia has not finalised the delivery time for its latest chip designed to comply with Washington's export restrictions for China amid a potential escalation of sanctions that could derail roll-out plans, industry sources said.\n\nThe California-based chip giant has developed the B20 for Chinese customers, which is a downgraded version of its most powerful Blackwell B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) launched in March, according to two sources, including one person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nNvidia originally planned to start shipping the new chip in the fourth quarter, but that timeline may no longer be realistic as new concerns have risen that an expansion of export controls reportedly being considered by Washington could affect the product, one of the sources said, along with another person familiar with the matter.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Reuters first reported Nvidia's new chip.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang present the Blackwell platform at an event ahead of Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nDespite compromised computing capabilities, the B20 will compensate with improved interconnection bandwidth, which allows binding multiple cards together to make up for the lower computing power of a single GPU, according to the people.\n\nNvidia, for which China was the third-largest market in the financial year ended January 28, is one of the most prominent tech firms bearing the brunt of increasingly stringent US sanctions on China's access to advanced semiconductors. Nvidia was barred from selling its A100 and H100 GPUs - two of the most in-demand chips for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models - to China in August 2022. It later modified those chips to create the A800 and H800 to get around those restrictions, but they were also barred from export to China last October.\n\nUS Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo warned chip companies last year to stop trying to design around export rules, saying she would control the new chips \"the very next day\".\n\nNvidia, however, has come under increasing competitive pressure in China from domestic chip makers enjoying a government push for technological self reliance, such as Huawei Technologies. This has led Nvidia to develop the H20, L20 and L2 GPUs in a fight to maintain its market share in the country.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for those chips was initially tepid, but sales of the H20 - the most powerful of the batch - have grown in recent months. While some companies continue to buy smaller quantities of Nvidia's more powerful GPUs on the black market, buying officially available chips gives them access to critical maintenance services needed for long-term support, according to the sources, who have met with Chinese Nvidia clients.\n\nA Nvidia chip is displayed at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Shanghai, June 26, 2024.

Photo: AFP>\n\nNvidia is expected to deliver more than 1 million H20 GPUs in China this year, racking up US$12 billion in sales, according to research firm SemiAnalysis. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, said Nvidia's H20 still offers better performance than Huawei's 910B, the Chinese tech giant's leading AI chip.\n\nThe B200, Nvidia's latest computing platform for AI workloads, offers computing power of up to 20 petaflops from 208 billion transistors. The Blackwell platform, including the B100, B200 and GB200 superchip, is expected to see production ramp up in the fourth quarter, while still accounting for less than 10 per cent of the total high-end GPU market, research firm TrendForce estimates.\n\nNvidia is also planning to launch a server called GB20 for the China market, according to a report from US tech news outlet The Information, citing unnamed sources. Apart from incorporating several B20 chips, the GB20 server includes central processing units (CPUs). The design is similar to that of the GB200-based server, which combines many B200 chips and its Arm-based Grace CPUs.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "2 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy Before They Soar as Much as 226% According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is a broad-based, tech-centric index tracking the performance of the more than 3,000 stocks listed on its exchange. In early July, the index hit a new all-time high, marking its sixth straight record close and its 27th so far this year. After that epic run, the Nasdaq is taking a well-deserved breather, down some 11% from its peak at recent prices. This has some investors wondering if the rally has run out of steam. Wall Street is weighing in and believes there's still more upside ahead.\n\nXM Investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos is among the bulls. \"Stock markets are enjoying the best of all worlds, buoyed by a resilient U.S. economy and speculation that Fed rate cuts are just around the corner, helping to justify stretched valuations,\" he wrote. UBS analyst Mark Haefele concurs, saying, \"All-time highs often generate investor concern that markets have peaked. Such worries are not supported by history,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\n\nHere are two Nasdaq stocks that still have plenty of room to run and could soar as much as 226%, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside 83%\n\nThe first Nasdaq stock with a boatload of potential is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The semiconductor specialist has been one of the biggest early winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by providing the chips that make the technology possible. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) were already the gold standard for video games, data centers, and earlier branches of AI. The advent of generative AI early last year sent the company's sales and its stock price into the stratosphere.\n\nNvidia's most recent results help illustrate why. For its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), record revenue of $26 billion surged 262% year over year, while earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 soared 629%. Its data center segment, which includes data center and other AI chips, saw revenue of $22.6 billion jump 427%.\n\nDespite stock price gains of more than 600% since early last year (as of this writing), Wall Street remains firmly behind Nvidia. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann has a Street-high price target of $200 and a buy rating on the shares. This represents potential upside of 83% compared to Thursday's closing price.\n\nMosesmann believes the chipmaker's product pipeline doesn't get enough credit. \"We see Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Rubin series driving 'value' market share in one of Silicon Valley's most successful silicon/platform product cycles,\" Mosesmann wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst isn't the only one bullish on Nvidia. Of the 58 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in June, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nSome investors may be put off by Nvidia's valuation, but that view is myopic. At recent prices, the stock is selling for just 34 times forward earnings, but Nvidia's growth rate illustrates why that premium is well deserved.\n\nMobileye: Implied upside of 226%\n\nThe second Nasdaq stock with a wealth of upside ahead is Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY). The vast majority of the company's revenue comes from the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) it pioneered more than 20 years ago. That move was prescient, as Mobileye controls an estimated 70% of the market, expecting to increase its share to 75% by 2026.\n\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is the potential for more broad adoption of autonomous vehicle systems, better known as self-driving cars. Several high-profile companies, including Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla, and Baidu have all deployed self-driving technology, though most of these systems aren't yet ready for Primetime. However, last year, Mobileye was named as the industry leader in autonomous vehicle technology in two seperate reports issued by Guidehouse Insights and ABI Research.\n\nThat said, the lumpiness of Mobileye's business has sent many fair-weather investors to the sidelines -- and therein lies the opportunity. For 2024, management is forecasting revenue of $1.6 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, representing a decline of about 27% year over year. As a result, the stock has shed more than 60% of its value so far this year. When Mobileye reported its results earlier this week, it cited a slowdown in auto production in the second half -- primarily in China -- for the reduction in its guidance. CEO Amnon Shashua was quick to point out that its guidance represents a \"worst-case scenario,\" which suggests that any improvement in the trajectory of its business could send the stock higher. That said, it's clear challenges remain.\n\nOne Wall Street analyst appears to be sticking to his guns. Despite a wave of price target reductions, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli hasn't updated his guidance post-earnings, maintaining a buy rating on Mobileye stock, with a price target of $53 (as of this writing). This represents potential upside of 226% compared to Thursday's closing price. The analyst calls the Q1 results \"encouraging,\" with potential customer wins representing potential catalysts for the remainder of this year. He goes on to say the underlying thesis \"remains very much intact.\"\n\nMany on Wall Street seem to agree. Of the 27 analysts who covered the stock in June, 23 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nFinally, at just 7 times forward sales, Mobileye is attractively priced, given the opportunity. Even a modest recovery in its business could send the stock soaring.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Bubble Bursting? These CEO Quotes Say No: The Boom Will Continue",
        "content": "This recent earnings season has seen a violent sell-off in many tech names that have rallied this year as investors have come to doubt the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nNo doubt, big companies continue to spend heavily on AI infrastructure. And while tech giants Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) posted quite good earnings, apparently, many investors were expecting even more. With the overall economy appearing to soften and the unemployment rate recently ticking up to 4.3%, the sell-off has recently intensified.\n\nYet, reading the commentary from leading tech companies, this investor thinks concerns over the AI revolution are short-sighted. Based on big tech CEO statements and one statement from a leading memory company at the end of June, there's a good case to be made that the spending boom will continue. That makes the recent pullback in AI stocks a long-term opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft post solid beats on AI growth\n\nAt first glance, it's entirely understandable why investors sold these stocks on earnings. While both Microsoft and Google beat on both revenue and earnings expectations, they also spent much more on capital expenditures to build AI data centers.\n\nWhile Alphabet beat expectations with 14% revenue growth and 31% earnings-per-share growth in the quarter, which was impressive, capital expenditures nearly doubled relative to last year. And while Microsoft beat expectations, posting revenue growth of 15% and EPS growth of 10% -- though operating income growth matched revenue growth at 15% -- its capital expenditures soared 55% relative to the prior-year quarter.\n\nClearly, investors are nervous that the current growth in operating income isn't matching the growth in spending. That would mean big tech stocks will either go down as they spend money on endeavors that don't generate sufficient returns on invested capital or eventually stop spending so much, which could hurt the likes of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks.\n\nHowever, each company's management remained quite bullish on AI. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noted the company's AI solutions were being used by some 2 million developers. Meanwhile, Google Cloud's revenue beat expectations, accelerating its growth rate with profitability inflecting to $1.2 billion, a new quarterly record. Pichai also added:\n\nWe are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen. But these things take time. But if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also had good things to say about its AI products. CEO Satya Nadella noted strong AI CoPilot versions of products were seeing traction across the customer base. Microsoft 365 CoPilot seats doubled quarter over quarter, and Github CoPilot is now bigger than Github was overall when Microsoft first bought it in 2018, according to Nadella. While Azure's growth technically disappointed Street expectations, Azure still posted 30% growth in constant currency, the strongest of the three major cloud providers.\n\nCash-rich companies continue to race to AGI\n\nSo, while these tech giants may have seen some slowing in parts of their economically sensitive businesses, AI products are still strong. Meanwhile, all the big cloud companies have significant cash on their balance sheets and the ability to invest.\n\nCould they slow spending if the economic climate gets bad enough? Perhaps, but one quote from memory specialist Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra at the end of June hinted the spending may keep going, regardless of the economy:\n\nWe are in the early innings of a multi-year race to enable artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which will revolutionize all aspects of life. Enabling AGI will require training ever-increasing model sizes with trillions of parameters and sophisticated servers for inferencing. AI will also permeate to the edge via AI PCs and AI smartphones, as well as smart automobiles and intelligent industrial systems.\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) is thought of as the \"holy grail\" of AI. It means a machine will be able to think, reason, and learn just as humans do, while simultaneously having access to all the knowledge in the entire world. This would make for a superintelligence that could theoretically benefit humanity in revolutionary ways.\n\nWhile many had thought AGI might not come before 2050, recent advances have put the target closer. Elon Musk predicted AGI in two years and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted roughly five years to AGI.\n\nTech giants have the cash to continue pursuing this race\n\nMehrotra's comment seems to indicate big tech giants all over the world are in the AI race for the long haul, or at least until we see AGI.\n\nWhile big tech businesses may see some slowing relative to expectations, these are still incredibly profitable businesses with huge balance sheets. So, as long as AGI appears to be a realistic goal on the medium-term horizon and these companies have the cash, the AI race looks to still be very much on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia in a ‘bubble’ says hedge fund; Intel downgraded",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nNvidia is in a ‘bubble’ and AI is ‘overhyped’ - Elliot\n\nElliot Management said Friday that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is in a “bubble” and the AI technology causing it is “overhyped,” according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.\n\nElliot raised concerns about the longevity of high-volume purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) by Big Tech companies, suggesting that mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia itself, are in “bubble land.”\n\nThe hedge fund noted that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time.” It argued that numerous AI applications are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.”\n\nThis commentary comes as chip stocks, which had surged due to hype around generative AI, have recently faced setbacks amid worries over the sustainability of large company investments.\n\nElliott also believes that AI has not yet delivered the significant productivity gains that were promised, stating that there are “few real uses” for AI currently, other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding.”\n\nThe letter concluded that AI, so far, is essentially software that has not provided “value commensurate with the hype” and that the current bubble could burst if Nvidia reports disappointing financial results, potentially “breaking the spell.”\n\nAnalysts raise price targets on Meta after strong earnings\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) delivered a solid report for the fiscal second quarter, leading to a wave of price target raises on Wall Street.\n\nOppenheimer analysts hiked their price target on the stock from $525 to $615 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock.\n\nThis adjustment signals a positive outlook for Meta's future, particularly following its second-quarter revenue results and third-quarter guidance.\n\nThe new price target implies a 24x multiple of the projected 2025 earnings per share (EPS), which is a 13% discount compared to Meta's peers and a 4% discount relative to the NASDAQ.\n\nOppenheimer's confidence in Meta is reinforced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's focus on AI spending, which is anticipated to boost future advertising revenue and user engagement.\n\nBofA Securities analysts also reiterated their Buy rating with a $563 price target on Meta, highlighting it as the \"top AI play in consumer Internet.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at Deutsche Bank upped their price target on Meta stock to $585 from $525, while maintaining a Buy rating.\n\nBofA downgrades Intel stock after disappointing Q2 print\n\nBank of America analysts downgraded Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock from Neutral to Underperform following a disappointing Q2 report that caused the stock to plummet nearly 30% on Friday.\n\nThe rating cut was primarily driven by a weak Q3 outlook and ongoing profitability challenges expected to persist through the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nBofA analysts identified several critical issues affecting Intel, including its Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM) structure, which is seen as less competitive compared to more focused rivals like Nvidia, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (BVMF:TSMC34).\n\nFurthermore, the bank pointed out Intel's lack of competitive AI accelerators, which diminishes its appeal to key cloud customers. Analysts also raised concerns about Intel's significant restructuring efforts, including a 15% reduction in headcount and cuts to capital expenditures, warning that these actions “could create unintended competitive consequences.”\n\nAnother factor influencing the downgrade is the suspension of Intel's dividend, potentially making the stock less appealing to some investors.\n\nDue to these concerns, BofA significantly slashed its earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for Intel for the fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026, and lowered its price objective (PO) for the stock from $35 to $23.\n\nHSBC cuts Arm rating amid less bullish AI PC narrative\n\nEarlier in the week, analysts at HSBC downgraded Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) shares from Hold to Reduce.\n\n\"We believe Arm has one of the best narratives among our tech coverage given expectations of significant content growth from rising royalties for its smartphones and future AI markets such as AI PC and datacentre CPUs,” analysts said.\n\n“However, Arm shares have continued to re-rate significantly, with y-t-d appreciation of 116%, and it now trades at FY26e PE of 72x – a significant premium relative to its largecap semiconductor peers.\"\n\nHSBC flagged short-term earnings downside risk ahead of the ARM’s 1Q25 results on 31 July, primarily due to a potential slowdown in Android smartphone momentum and a less bullish AI PC narrative.\n\nARM shares fell more than 20% across the last five sessions due to softer-than-expected guidance and broader tech sell-off.\n\nDatadog stock upgraded to Buy at BTIG\n\nThe investment banking firm BTIG upgraded Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) stock from Neutral to Buy this week, setting a price target of $143 per share. The upward revision is based on strong market checks and an \"underappreciated Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) displacement opportunity.\"\n\nAnalysts at BTIG highlight Datadog as a leading player in the observability market, poised for substantial growth with innovative products and features like Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, and Bits AI.\n\n\"In short, we see DDOG as the best play in the observability market with a large opportunity to gain share,\" they state. \"We also think new products and features (such as Flex Logs, LLM Monitoring, Bits AI, etc.) create a compelling long-term growth opportunity.\"\n\nThe firm’s optimism is bolstered by recent fieldwork, which included discussions with ten partners, half of which skewed towards large enterprises. BTIG concluded that cloud cost optimization efforts tied to the broader macroeconomic environment are largely complete, benefiting observability spending.\n\nBTIG also noted that despite Microsoft’s slight cloud growth disappointment, the general trend points to improving growth at the top three hyperscale cloud IaaS providers, suggesting a favorable outlook for observability spending.\n\nFurthermore, BTIG believes Datadog is well-positioned to capture additional market share from Splunk following its acquisition by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). While this displacement is not expected to have a significant impact in 2024, it represents a substantial opportunity over the next three to four years.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Nvidia in a ‘bubble’ says hedge fund; Intel downgraded\n\nHedge funds grow bearish amid economic slowdown jitters, Goldman says\n\nDelay to Nvidia's new AI chip could affect Microsoft, Google, Meta, the Information says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Dynamite Long-Term Stocks to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "Why is earnings season the perfect time to make your move?\n\nEarnings announcements lead to market volatility. So, this allows investors to bag top-quality stocks at a discount. The ongoing mixed earnings season has led to a dip in several stocks. And, while it could be a temporary reaction, it can allow you to load up your portfolio. Now is the time to start looking for long-term stocks to buy on dip.\n\nRemember that temporary market volatility is just that, temporary. It could be an immediate reaction to the numbers or the guidance and will cool down in the long term. Some of the blue-chip stocks have seen a dip after the recent results announcement.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s dive into the seven long-term stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple reasons to add Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to your portfolio but one of the biggest reasons is the dip in the stock after the results. The company missed revenue expectations and reported a lower guidance which led to a disappointment in the market.\n\nAmazon reported a revenue of $147.98 billion and an EPS of $1.26. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue stood at $26.3 billion while the advertising revenue missed expectations and came in at $12.8 billion.\n\nThe management added that consumers have become cost-conscious and are choosing cheaper products which will lead to a dip in revenue in the third quarter. The weaker-than-expected guidance impacted the stock which is down 7% over the past month and is exchanging hands for $166.24, much lower than the 52-week high of $201.\n\nAmazon’s long-term picture looks attractive and it continues to hold a large market share in the cloud computing segment. AMZN will bounce back as consumer spending improves, so plan to buy and hold for the next five years.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) doesn’t need any introduction since the brand is a popular name in the sports industry. The legacy business has had a tough year with its stock down 30% year-to-date (YTD). This dip is due to a drop in sales, but I believe Nike has the power to bounce back.\n\nThe company’s fiscal 2024 results saw a modest 1% year-over-year (YOY) rise in sales and generated $51.4 billion in revenue. Its management is aware of the lackluster sales and is planning a comeback. It has increased the marketing and advertising budget by 6% and is looking to benefit from the Paris Olympics as a catalyst. Thus, Nike has worked on an ad campaign around it.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at $73, the stock has steadily dropped since January and is much lower than the 52-week high of $123. This is a long-term buy and hold in the dip. I am certain Nike has the potential to make a comeback and is a dividend-paying stock with a yield of 2%.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline lodging marketplace, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) hasn’t had a good year so far despite a strong start. ABNB stock is down 7% in the past six months and is trading for $127.88 as of this writing. Rising competition and the growing housing inventory have caused trouble for the business. However, its fundamentals are strong.\n\nIn the first quarter, it saw a 17% YOY jump in the active listings, and it started to expand into less popular markets. It saw impressive growth in the gross nights booked, and the total revenue jumped 18% YOY. The company had the most profitable first-quarter ever but it didn’t reflect on the stock price.\n\nAirbnb is set to report results next week, and a weaker guidance could lead to a dip in the stock. I believe Airbnb is a solid business and an ideal long-term player. Despite competition, the company has the potential to dominate the market and has performed exceptionally well over the past year. The pent-up travel demand and ongoing summer holidays could boost the company’s financials.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nWhen McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is lagging in the market, you do not need to worry about the company. Instead, you need to start worrying about the economy. MCD has understood that higher costs are no longer going to work and with cost-conscious consumers, McDonald’s will have to derive a plan to bounce back.\n\nThe company has launched the $5 adult happy meal which has been a success and is being extended. However, the recent quarterly results were disappointing. It missed earnings and revenue estimates. The company saw a revenue of $6.49 billion and an EPS of $2.97, the revenue was flat YOY. Also, it saw a dip in same-store sales.\n\nThis isn’t something that happens with McDonald’s often, but the inflation has hurt its business. The stock is down 9% over the past six months and is exchanging hands for $268. I am certain McDonald’s will see better days as consumer spending improves, until then you can enjoy the dividend yield of 2.49%. It continues to remain a tasty restaurant stock for the long term.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest competitor and a strong player in the artificial intelligence race, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is making every attempt to win the market.\n\nThe company reported impressive numbers for the second quarter with a revenue of $5.8 billion and earnings per share of $0.69. The revenue saw a 9% YOY jump while it swung from an operating loss a year ago to an operating profit in the second quarter. AMD saw a record growth in the data center revenue with a jump of 115% YOY.\n\nDespite the strong fundamentals, AMD stock hasn’t been able to soar higher. It is exchanging hands for $133 and is down 25% in the past six months. AMD’s achievements may not look as bright if compared with Nvidia. But if you look at the company independently and the progress it has made, AMD does shine amongst the competitors. The dip is a chance to buy this AI stock.\n\nThe management has raised the full-year revenue guidance for the AI data center GPUs to $4.5 billion, driven by the rapid adoption of its MI300 series GPUs.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) Silhouette of person holding mobile phone with SoFi (SOFI) logo shown in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nFintech company  SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) has done everything right. Yet, the stock hasn’t been able to hit double-digits since the start of 2024. Trading at $6.73, SOFI stock has dropped 25% YTD. It recently reported stellar fundamentals and saw significant growth in its user base. Its revenue came in at $599 million and saw a 41% jump in members.\n\nI have been recommending SOFI stock for a while now but many are worried about the future of the company after a rate cut. SoFi Technologies has established itself as a very strong financial institution which doesn’t rely on a single segment for revenue.\n\nThe diversified business will keep the revenue steady in the coming quarters. SoFi Technologies has started to rely less on lending and is pivoting towards financial services products which now comprise 45% of the company’s revenue.\n\nDespite the fantastic results, the stock price did not budge. However, I think it is a sign that you should load up on this fintech. It could double your money in the next two years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) can be an excellent addition to your investment portfolio. The company holds the largest AI chip market share and is benefitting from the imbalance between the demand and supply of chips. Set to report results next month, Nvidia will be sharing how its clients profit from their AI chips.\n\nDespite the competition, Nvidia has remained a tech industry leader, and I strongly believe its dominance will continue throughout the year. The stock has become affordable after the recent stock split. But it is down 10% over the past month due to the tech industry pullback.\n\nWhile it has nothing to do with Nvidia or its fundamentals, the pullback is a chance to pounce. NVDA will report impressive numbers and beat expectations with revenue exceeding $28 billion. This could give the stock a good reason to rally. Long-term investors who held on to Nvidia have already taken home solid profits. This tech stock wouldn’t disappoint.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Aug. 28",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) transformation from a gaming industry specialist to an artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse has been nothing short of phenomenal. Accounting for roughly 70% to 95% of the chips used in training and inferencing large language models (according to Mizuho Securities), Nvidia has emerged as the biggest beneficiary and enabler of the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nWhile Nvidia's stock has gained almost 140% in the past year and a dazzling 471% over the past three years, I don't think the positive impact of this multiyear tailwind on Nvidia's share price will be exhausted in a few quarters. There is still room for the stock to grow -- especially after it became more accessible to shareholders following its stock split.\n\nNvidia has surpassed consensus revenue estimates in 11 of the past 12 quarters and earnings estimates in 10 of the past 12. While that's no guarantee the company will keep surprising the market, investors awaiting the company's upcoming earnings announcement (scheduled for Aug. 28) can be confident it's taking advantage of a huge opportunity. I think Nvidia stock is still a strong buy for the following reasons.\n\nDominance in the AI data center market\n\nNvidia's data center offerings, including graphics processing units (GPUs), AI software stack, supporting frameworks, and other systems, have been in high demand in AI and high-performance computing applications. Cloud service providers, consumer internet companies, and businesses in industries as varied as finance, healthcare, and automotive are relying extensively on the company's solutions to build their AI infrastructure.\n\nSubsequently, the company's data center business saw explosive growth in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025 (ending April 28), with revenue soaring 427% year over year to $22.6 billion. Furthermore, with demand far outstripping supply for the company's next-generation H200 chips and Blackwell architecture chips, Nvidia expects momentum for its data center business to continue in the coming quarters.\n\nTechnology leadership\n\nNvidia's rapid pace of technological innovation has made it difficult for competitors to capture market share. The company has already launched a new GPU architecture called Blackwell, which is 4 times faster in training and 30 times faster in inferencing large language models than the company's flagship H100 GPU. Blackwell architecture has been designed to be backward-compatible with software stack, enabling customers to easily transition to advanced chips. The company has also announced plans to release successors to its H100 GPU annually, a major shift from its previous strategy of launching major chips every two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has also built a robust software stack to support its AI GPU infrastructure and has partnered extensively with multiple cloud service providers. The recently launched Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM) software also helps developers quickly build and deploy AI applications. In the face of such developments, any client who wishes to transition to competing hardware has to face high switching costs. Nvidia's commitment to innovation has further resulted in its clients opting to upgrade and expand their AI infrastructure.\n\nExpanding total addressable market\n\nNvidia has positioned itself as a full-stack AI platform provider to capture a bigger part of the global AI infrastructure spending. Besides advanced AI GPUs, the company also offers all other essential infrastructure required by clients for AI production -- including central processing units, data processing units, advanced networking solutions (InfiniBand, Ethernet, Spectrum-X), software ecosystem (CUDA platform, Nvidia Inference Microservices), and servers.\n\nNvidia is also gearing up for new data center revenue streams from the sovereign AI market. Governments across the world are striving to develop domestic AI capabilities, and Nvidia is partnering with these national and local players as a major AI infrastructure provider. On the last earnings call, the company said it expects sovereign AI revenue to be in the \"high single-digit billions\"  in fiscal 2025, which will end Jan. 31.\n\nNvidia expects automotive to be the largest enterprise vertical for its data center business and to generate multibillion-dollar revenue this fiscal year. The company has already supported Tesla in training an AI cluster comprising 35,000 H100 GPUs for autonomous driving. The company has also secured multiple design wins with several leading electric vehicle players for its Nvidia Drive Thor AI car platform.\n\nImproving profitability\n\nDespite ongoing investments in technological innovation, Nvidia has expanded its profit margins. In the first quarter, the company's non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin jumped by 12.1 percentage points year over year to 78.9%. Net income also soared by 462% year over year to $15.24 billion. This highlights the company's robust pricing power and ability to grow revenue faster than expenses.\n\nShareholder returns and valuation\n\nNvidia returned $7.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the first quarter. The company split its stock on a 10-for-1 basis effective June 10, and announced a 150% increase in the quarterly dividend on a post-split basis. These moves highlight Nvidia's confidence in its future growth prospects and commitment to returning value to shareholders.\n\nAt recent prices, Nvidia is trading at just under 35 times trailing-12-month sales, a significant premium to its historical five-year average around 26. However, although the stock is expensive, the valuation seems justified considering the solid growth projections for the company. Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by a solid 97.5% year over year to $120.3 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) to soar by 111.4% year over year to $2.74 in fiscal 2025.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should consider picking up at least a small stake in this stock ahead of its second-quarter earnings results.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, NVIDIA fair value estimate is US$89.53 NVIDIA's US$107 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$140 analyst price target for NVDA is 56% more than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$59.9b US$80.1b US$93.8b US$118.7b US$128.7b US$136.4b US$143.1b US$149.1b US$154.6b US$159.7b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x14 Analyst x8 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.95% Est @ 4.92% Est @ 4.19% Est @ 3.68% Est @ 3.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9%  US$55.5k US$68.9k US$74.7k US$87.6k US$88.0k US$86.5k US$84.1k US$81.2k US$78.0k US$74.7k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$779b\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$160b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.5%) = US$3.0t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.0t÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$1.4t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.2t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$107, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NVIDIA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.308. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for NVIDIA\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nNo apparent threats visible for NVDA.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "title": "Apple Just Exposed a Massive Risk for Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) nearly $3 trillion valuation hinges on a critical assumption: The company's utter dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is sustainable. Nvidia's market share has been estimated as high as 95%, and while competitors including AMD and Intel offer AI chips of their own, they've made little headway against the Nvidia juggernaut.\n\nHere's the problem: That assumption is probably not going to hold up in the long run. Nvidia has some important advantages, including a mature software ecosystem and best-in-class hardware, but cracks are starting to form. The biggest crack so far is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to avoid Nvidia's GPUs entirely while training its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence platform.\n\nNo Nvidia, no problem\n\nApple is late to the generative AI party, but it's now full steam ahead bringing AI features to its iPhones, Macs, and other devices. Apple Intelligence, which will go into beta later this year, includes AI-powered writing tools, image creation capabilities, a version of Siri that isn't embarrassing, and other useful features. None of this is groundbreaking, but these features will be deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem and available to the company's massive user base.\n\nApple has trained multiple AI models, including powerful server-based models that will run in the cloud and more compact models that will run directly on Apple devices. Training an AI model is computationally intensive, and Nvidia's GPUs have been the standard choice since the AI boom began. Apple notably took a different route.\n\nApple detailed the AI models that power Apple Intelligence in a recent research paper, and the big surprise is that the tech giant shunned Nvidia's GPUs entirely. The server-based models were trained on 8,192 TPUv4 AI chips from Alphabet's Google, while the on-device models were trained on a smaller number of TPUv5 AI chips.\n\nGoogle has been designing custom AI chips for years. The company's sixth-generation TPU, called Trillium, was announced in May. Google uses its custom chips to train its own AI models, and now Apple has chosen to do the same.\n\nApple's decision kills the argument that Nvidia's GPUs are the only game in town for AI training.\n\nA huge risk to Nvidia's profits\n\nThe AI chip market could grow fast enough for Nvidia's revenue to continue to rise at a healthy pace even if it loses market share. However, it's hard to imagine that Nvidia will be able to maintain its sky-high profit margins as competition chips away at its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported a net income of $14.9 billion on $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended April 28. It is highly unlikely that Nvidia will be able to maintain a net income margin above 50% in the long run. Competition will inevitably bring the company's profitability back down to earth.\n\nAI inference, the act of using trained AI models, doesn't necessarily require powerful GPUs at all. Intel's latest Xeon server CPUs, for example, can run some inference workloads, and PCs with dedicated AI chips are set to become the norm. AI training does require powerful accelerators, but Apple's choice to avoid Nvidia's GPUs is a strong sign that Nvidia's dominance of the AI training market is coming to an end.\n\nNvidia's AI growth story has been incredible, but Apple just delivered a serious blow to the AI king.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThroughout this earnings season, investors have been especially focused on Big Tech’s capital expenditures.\n\nThis spending is seen as a barometer for how bullish Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet are about what AI will do for them. Though, as Julie Hyman wrote Thursday, it’s a little more complicated than that, since they must go all in to even get a seat at the table.\n\nBut the nature of supply chain dynamics means that what gathers and melts in the mountains pours into the rivers and lakes.\n\nAnd as our Chart of the Week shows, Big Tech is still making it rain. And Nvidia is the lake.\n\nAccording to estimates from Bloomberg, coupled with quarterly reports, more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from some familiar names among the “Magnificent Seven” stocks — Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nThe biggest transfer is from Microsoft, with spending from the world’s most valuable company accounting for 19% of Nvidia’s revenue. This makes the company its biggest customer by far, nearly doubling Meta’s spend and tripling that of Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAnd on the Microsoft side, Bloomberg’s data shows Nvidia accounts for 45% of its capital expenditures, whereas the chipmaker only gets 15% of Alphabet’s outlays, for example.\n\nIn the AI jungle, this data is a reminder that the chipmakers eat first, long before the hyperscalers can offer much more than hints to investors about when the AI investments will turn into AI revenue streams.\n\nStill, this is one of the key charts that have helped power the market, especially through the tech earnings season.\n\nFor now, the lack of revenue isn’t too worrying to investors — though doubts are rising! — as it’s still hard to imagine the trillion-dollar Microsoft doesn’t know something they don’t about the opportunity.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has pulled off a historic rise over the last decade, with its share price up more than 25,000% since 2014. The company has taken the chip market by storm, almost singlehandedly building the consumer chip industry into what it is today.\n\nNvidia was one of the first companies to begin selling graphics processing units (GPUs) directly to customers, who use these chips to build high-performance PCs for activities like gaming and video editing.\n\nThe chipmaker's direct-to-consumer business remains lucrative, with its gaming segment up 18% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Nvidia's success in desktop GPUs has given it the brand power and financial resources to expand to multiple other sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, healthcare, government, robotics, and self-driving vehicles.\n\nNvidia's stock has climbed about 140% in the last 12 months but appears to only just be getting started. So, despite recent growth, Nvidia's stock remains a compelling option worth considering this year.\n\nThe potential to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion\n\nNvidia temporarily achieved a market cap above $3 trillion earlier this year, joining Microsoft and Apple in the elite club of trillion-dollar companies. However, its market cap is currently around $2.7 billion after a slight correction and pullback from tech industry investors. Yet, Nvidia's significant growth potential suggests it won't be long before it rises above that $3 trillion milestone again -- and this time, for good.\n\nAI has highlighted the crucial role chips have to play in the future of tech, equipping developers with the power necessary to build the generative software. Meanwhile, AI is only one of many industries that require high-powered chips to move forward, representing many growth catalysts for Nvidia.\n\nData from JPMorgan Chase shows that prominent tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms will reach capital expenditures totaling $201 billion by May 2025. That figure will be up from about $140 billion in 2023, representing a 44% rise. Much of that will be spent on expanding their positions in AI, building data centers, and equipping them with GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is well-positioned to enjoy massive gains from increased AI spending, with its GPUs responsible for about 90% of the market. The company posted revenue gains of 262% year over year in Q1 2025, up 18% sequentially. The increase was mainly thanks to a 427% increase in its data center segment, illustrating a rise in AI chip sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has enjoyed stellar growth from AI, even while many markets have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with the technology. Large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT have proven the utility of language generation. However, as Meta Chief Scientist Yann LeCun recently pointed out, these platforms \"don't really understand the physical world. They don't really have persistent memory. They can't really reason, and they certainly can't plan.\"\n\nThe best and most efficient use of AI has likely not even been thought of yet, with decades of understanding likely ahead. And Nvidia is well-equipped to continue fueling the market's development. Increased spending in AI will likely continue to boost earnings and raise its market cap to well above $3 trillion.\n\nNvidia isn't trading at a bargain, but its stock is a better value than you might think\n\nNvidia's stock recently was trading at about 65 times its earnings. That figure beats its biggest rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of an eye-watering 206. The data shows that Nvidia is a better value than its competitor, but not exactly a huge bargain. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, this chart shows that Nvidia's current P/E is below its five-year average for the metric, during which the company's stock price skyrocketed by 2,450%. As a result, a high P/E doesn't necessarily mean the company's stock will fall short in growth.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia's monster potential in AI and tech in general, its stock is too good to ignore for anyone looking for a long-term investment. The company will likely continue profiting from rising chip demand for years as more and more markets require powerful hardware to develop.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Boring Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2029",
        "content": "On Wall Street, very few things are guaranteed. However, change is one of the few constants.\n\nOver multiple decades, it's commonplace for Wall Street's largest companies by market cap to be shuffled up and down the proverbial leaderboard. New innovations, mounting competition, legal judgments, acquisitions, collaborations, bankruptcies, and even acts of God contribute to this leaderboard carousel. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn June, for a brief moment, artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) ascended to the top pedestal and was the world's most valuable publicly traded company. But as history has shown time and again, this fairy tale story is unlikely to last.\n\nWhile high-growth AI stocks are currently enjoying all the glory on Wall Street, it's my contention that, by 2029, three boring stocks -- i.e., time-tested businesses that can continually deliver for investors without being in the spotlight -- will be worth more than Nvidia.\n\nHistory says Nvidia is going to lose its luster\n\nIn less than 18 months, we witnessed Nvidia's valuation soar from $360 billion to a peak of almost $3.5 trillion. This never-before-seen climb for a market-leading business has been driven entirely by excitement surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are given tasks that humans would typically oversee. The key here is that AI-driven systems have the capacity to learn without human intervention and evolve over time. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are effectively the brains powering decision-making in enterprise AI data centers.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's operational ramp has been virtually flawless, history tells investors that its stock is bound to lose its luster, sooner rather than later.\n\nDespite there being a good number of next-big-thing innovations, technologies, and trends over the last three decades, all of which promised big-dollar addressable markets, none managed to avoid an early stage bubble-bursting event. Investors consistently overestimate how quickly businesses and/or consumers will adopt and utilize new technologies or trends. In other words, artificial intelligence hasn't been given adequate time to mature as a technology, which almost certainly means the AI bubble is going to burst and drag Nvidia down with it.\n\nNvidia's valuation has also reached a precarious level. When shares peaked at more than $140 on June 20, the company's trailing-12-month (TTM) price to sales (P/S) ratio surpassed 43. This is pretty much on par with where the TTM P/S ratios of Cisco Systems and Amazon petered out when the dot-com bubble burst.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is set to face operational challenges, as well. On top of external competitors taking on its AI-GPUs in high-compute data centers, Nvidia has to worry about its top four customers by net sales all developing AI-GPUs of their own. While these chips are unlikely to be superior to Nvidia's, they're going to be cheaper and are bound to take up valuable data center \"real estate.\"\n\nThe picture I've painted above suggests Nvidia can lose its trillion-dollar market cap in the coming years. But as Nvidia fades, I'd expect three tried-and-true boring businesses to leapfrog it in value. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\n\nThe first \"boring\" company that's quietly but steadily delivered a nearly 20% annualized return spanning almost six decades is conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Berkshire is run by billionaire CEO Warren Buffett, who's delivered a greater than 5,325,000% return to his Class A shareholders (BRK.A) since taking over in the mid-1960s.\n\nWith a current market cap of $947 billion, Buffett's company is knocking on the door of becoming a trillion-dollar business. Patience is the not-so-subtle secret that'll help it surpass this psychological mark, as well as top Nvidia in market valuation over the next five years.\n\nOne of the many reasons Berkshire Hathaway has been unstoppable for so long is the Oracle of Omaha's penchant for favoring cyclical businesses.\n\nBuffett and his team are keenly aware that recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle. They also know that recessions are short-lived, while periods of economic expansion typically stick around for multiple years. This is why Berkshire's 44-stock, $404 billion investment portfolio is prominently composed of cyclical companies that can take advantage of lengthy economic expansions.\n\nWarren Buffett and his team are big-time fans of dividend stocks, too. Public companies that regularly dole out dividends are often profitable on a recurring basis and have proven their ability to navigate recessions. What's more, a report released from Hartford Funds last year found that income stocks have more than doubled up the average annual return of non-payers over the last half century -- 9.17% vs. 4.27%.\n\nAnother reason investors should expect Berkshire Hathaway to leapfrog Nvidia's market cap by 2029 is its mammoth share repurchase program. Buffett has bought back more than $77 billion worth of his company's stock since July 2018. Share repurchases are helping to reduce the company's outstanding share count, which is boosting its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nVisa and Mastercard\n\nThe other two boring stocks that can leap past Nvidia's market cap by 2029 are payment-processing juggernauts Visa(NYSE: V) and Mastercard(NYSE: MA). I'm discussing these companies together because they effectively share the same catalysts and headwinds.\n\nVisa and Mastercard ended July with respective market caps of $514 billion and $428 billion. If both stocks were to double over the next five years, they'd have a realistic chance to top Nvidia's valuation.\n\nBeing cyclical is definitely an overlooked, but important, catalyst for both companies. Financial stocks undeniably benefit when the U.S. and/or global economy are expanding. Since recessions usually resolve in less than a year, it means Visa and Mastercard are regularly benefiting from growth in consumer and enterprise spending.\n\nTo build on this point, both companies have chosen to avoid participating as lenders. While this does mean forgoing the potential to collect interest income from cardholders, it removes any direct loan loss or credit delinquency liability during economic contractions and recessions. Neither Visa nor Mastercard have to set capital aside to cover losses during downturns, which is a big reason they're able to bounce back so quickly from recessions.\n\nDespite their size, Visa and Mastercard can sustain their double-digit earnings growth rates throughout the decade, if not well beyond. They're both able to generate predictable cash flow from developed markets, and are staring down a multidecade expansion opportunity into fast-growing but chronically underbanked regions of the world, including the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Persistent double-digit cross-border volume growth speaks to this international opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? Evidence Is Piling Up That Provides a Clear Answer",
        "content": "There's no getting around it: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) early last year has been a boon to chipmaker Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long been the gold standard for video games, data centers, and early branches of AI.\n\nThe uptake of generative AI kicked off in earnest in early 2023, making Nvidia the hottest ticket in town. Shares are up nearly 700% during that time as the company controls an estimated 92% of the data- center chip market -- where most generative AI lives -- according to IoT Analytics. Those gains haven't all been in a straight line, however, as Nvidia stock plunged as much as 23% during the last three weeks of July.\n\nBehind the slump are fears that the adoption of AI might soon trail off. After the company generated triple-digit revenue and profit growth over the past year, investors have begun to wonder if the end was in sight. The evidence has begun to pile up and provides a clear answer to the quintessential investor question: Is it too late to buy Nvidia stock? Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Image source: Getty Images.https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/multimedia/search?origin=multimedia&keywords=gb200\n\nThe question of demand\n\nGenerative AI requires a great deal of computational horsepower to run the large language models (LLMs) that underpin the technology. That, combined with the massive amounts of data necessary, makes AI largely the purview of the world's largest tech companies, which are also Nvidia's biggest customers. These tech giants have begun to report their quarterly results, providing investors with insight into the state of AI adoption -- and the evidence is compelling.\n\nDuring Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)second-quarter earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said of AI, \"We are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area ... aggressively investing upfront in a defining category.\" Indeed, the company's capital expenditures (capex) of $13.2 billion were higher than many anticipated, and Alphabet plans capex spending of roughly $12 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year. The spending was \"overwhelmingly\" spent on the servers and data centers needed for AI.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 Q4 (ended June 30), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)also admitted to going on an AI-centric spending spree, with capex of $19 billion. CFO Amy Hood noted that \"cloud and AI-related spending represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures.\" Hood went on the say that fiscal 2025 capex is \"expected to be higher than fiscal year 2024.\"\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) spent more than $8.1 billion on capex in Q2 and is now predicting full-year spending of $37 billion to $40 billion, with \"significant capex growth in 2025 to support our AI research and product development efforts,\" accoring to CFO Susan Li.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's biggest customers\n\nThese capex spending numbers and the accompanying management commentary make clear that Big Tech plans to continue spending big on AI. Furthermore, the fact that much of this spending will be devoted to servers and data centers suggests that Nvidia will be the beneficiary of much of this spending.\n\nWhile Nvidia doesn't provide the identities of its biggest customers, Wall Street has done some sleuthing. Analysts at Bloomberg and Barclays parsed the numbers and concluded that Nvidia's four largest customers -- responsible for roughly 40% of its revenue -- are:\n\nMicrosoft: 15% Meta Platforms: 13% Amazon: 6.2% Alphabet: 5.8%\n\nThree of the four have been clear about their AI spending, and by the time you read this, Amazon's results will be out, and I have no doubt its spending on AI will be equally robust.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding\n\nThe past year has been a whirlwind for Nvidia investors. After generating triple-digit growth last year, the company followed that up with record results to kick off the current year. For fiscal 2025's Q1 (ended April 28), Nvidia delivered record revenue that grew 262% year over year to $26 billion, fueled by record data-center revenue of $22.6 billion, up 427%. Profits also exploded higher as diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.98 surged 629%.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report its Q2 results after the market close on Aug. 28, and if the commentary provided by its Big Tech customers is any indication, Nvidia should have another strong showing up its sleeve.\n\nThe company's forecast is calling for revenue of $28 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 107%, with a commensurate uptick in profitability. It's worth noting that Nvidia has a history of eclipsing its own guidance, so the results could conceivably be higher.\n\nFinally, at roughly 38 time forward earnings, Nvidia trades at a slight premium, but given the company's triple-digit growth, that's not surprising.\n\nIn my mind, the preponderance of the evidence is clear: Nvidia stock is still a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings.Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of “demand cracks.” He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\n\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more “attractive.”\n\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\n\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\n\nThill thinks the AI “payoff” time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\n\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock’s price target at $135.\n\n“We downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.” New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\n\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has “no idea what I’m talking about” or it’s the market that just does not understand.\n\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the “driving seat” of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won’t be as easy as the market assumes.\n\nRecently, Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker’s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 174% over the past year.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Chip Stocks Staring At Another Bloodbath As Intel Tumbles, Nvidia Dips 4%, ASML Crumbles Over 6%: What's Ailing The Sector Friday\n\nThe tech stocks, which led the stock market rebound seen since in early 2023, have come under pressure since early July, with the weakness more concentrated in the semiconductor space. Early indications suggest these stocks could be in for more losses on Friday.\n\nEconomic Evidence Not-so Positive: The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) traded down about 3% in premarket trading, adding to the 7%+ drop seen on Thursday. The sell-off seen on Thursday came on the back of some sore data points, including weak manufacturing activity data and a spike in jobless claims. These data points added weight to the view that the economy is slowing down and could potentially face the risk of a hard landing.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his team have hinted at beginning rate cuts as early as the September meeting. Rate cuts could bring the spotlight to the SMID-cap stocks, which have underperformed the broader market in the bull run seen since 2023, accelerating the rotation out of mega-cap techs.\n\nIncidentally, small-caps also retreated on Thursday, suffering more losses relative to the tech stocks.\n\nSector-Specific Risks: Semiconductor stocks are facing some sector-specific risks such as the U.S.-China standoff, which will remove from the equation a key market for these companies. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are already facing the music as they scramble to offset the impact by rolling out chips that can help them sidestep the China chip ban imposed by the U.S.\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nRegulatory overhang is an added impediment for these companies. Nvidia for one is stymied by the possibility of the U.S. Department of Justice initiating a probe over the Jensen Huang-led company monopolizing the market for AI accelerators.\n\nAlso weighing down on sentiment is a disappointing earnings report for Intel Corp.(NASDAQ:INTC) and the company also announced workforce reduction and suspension of dividends in the wake of the predicament.\n\nThe ultimate fate of chip stocks in Friday’s session will hinge on how the July non-farm payrolls report pans out. A modest slowdown in job growth and contained average hourly earnings could prompt traders to buy back beaten-down stocks. On the contrary, very weak job growth and/or a rise in the average hourly earnings – a proxy for inflation, could steepen the sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending:America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\r\n The Stock Moves: Intel is leading the sell-off with a 21.79% plunge to $22.72, according to Benzinga Pro data. Among the other major decliners in the premarket are:\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) fell 6.52% to $826.13. Arm Holdings plc (NYSE:ARM) was down about 5.37% to $114.38. AMD was down a more modest 0.70% to $131.61. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 2.30% to $140.64. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) slipped 3.46% to $96.\n\nThe SOXX has pulled back to a nearly 2-month low with its plunge on Thursday. The exchange-traded fund closed at its lowest level since May 9, settling down 7.21% to $218.42. In the premarket on Friday, it was down 2.94% at $211.99. Among the other sector-specific ETFs:\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) fell 3.68% to $222.50. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (NASDAQ:SOXL) plunged 7.91% to $32.23. GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NASDAQ:NVDL), an ETF that tracks Nvidia’s performance, fell 7.48% to $47.60.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed off the lows of the session, down almost 2% while Intel (INTC) shares cratered over 26% and a broad decline in chip stocks led the tech sector lower as markets tumbled following a weaker-than-expected jobs report.\n\nFollowing the July jobs report, which showed job growth slowed last month and the unemployment rate reached a nearly three-year high, the Nasdaq slipped into correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from its most recent high.\n\nChip stocks have been at the center of recent market weakness, and news from Nvidia and Intel on Friday did not help the cause.\n\nIntel results out late Thursday missed on the top and bottom lines as the company also announced a $10 billion cost reduction plan, which includes cutting 15% of its workforce while also suspending its dividend.\n\nIntel's poor quarter followed a cautious forecast from chipmaker Arm Holdings (ARM) on Thursday, while Amazon (AMZN) offered a revenue and profit warning for the current quarter that sent shares of the ecommerce giant down as much as 12%.\n\nWith Nvidia the only one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that hasn't reported its latest quarterly results, an emerging theme is that Wall Street's patience with massive AI investments appears to be wearing a little thin.\n\nHedge fund Elliott Management sent a note to clients saying megacap stocks, especially Nvidia, were in \"bubble land,\" while the technology behind artificial intelligence is \"overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time,\" according to a report from the Financial Times published on Friday. Nvidia on track to end week in negative territory, along with other chip stocks\n\nAdditionally, a report from the Information late Thursday said Nvidia faces a potential probe from the Justice Department over antitrust complaints from its rivals, another piece of negative news flow for the challenged chip trade.\n\nNvidia and other chip stocks are set to end the week in the red after a volatile few days.\n\nThe entire sector saw a massive one-day jump on Wednesday after chipmaker AMD (AMD) posted better-than-expected guidance and Microsoft (MSFT) revealed higher spending on data center infrastructure in its latest quarterly results.\n\nAI chip suppliers like Nvidia stand to benefit from Big Tech's increased investments.\n\nNvidia rose nearly 13% on Wednesday, buoyed by a bullish note from Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore, who moved the stock to a 'Top Pick' after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\n\nThe movement over the past two days has more than erased Wednesday's gains, and Nvidia closed out the week down almost 6%.

        "title": "Nvidia is facing an antitrust probe from US regulators amid competitor complaints, report says",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Antitrust tensions are heating up in the chipmaking industry. Rivals have accused Wall Street darling Nvidia of abusing its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence — and the U.S. Justice Department is now investigating these complaints, technology news site The Information reported.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the discussions, Justice Department officials are looking into concerns Nvidia is potentially cornering the market and pressuring its customers to unfairly retain business. That includes allegations of Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant and its competitors.\n\nThe Information also reported that U.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors about the complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment or provide further information when reached by The Associated Press on Friday.\n\nBut a statement from Nvidia said the company “wins on merit” — and competes “based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\"\n\nWithout directly acknowledging details of The Information’s Thursday report, the company added that it is “happy to provide any information regulators need.”\n\nNvidia has faced calls for an antitrust investigation from some Democratic lawmakers and progressive groups before. Earlier this week, 10 progressive advocacy groups — including Demand Progress Education Fund and Tech Oversight Project — penned a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter in support of an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker.\n\n“Nvidia is the world’s chip gatekeeper,” the groups wrote, arguing the company had “bullied its way into a prominent investment position” by leveraging scarce supply alongside tactics like blocking customers from doing business with competitors. “Such a company deserves the most aggressive scrutiny that the Department of Justice can bring to bear.”\n\nNvidia’s has cemented itself as a poster child for the artificial intelligence boom — and in the process become one of the most valuable companies in the world. In June, the tech giant briefly reached a market value of more than $3.3 trillion.\n\nSome of that market momentum has stalled a little since — and any stock climbing to such heights is vulnerable to some investors selling shares to lock in profits. On Friday afternoon, shares for Nvidia were down 3%.\n\nView comments",

The news has sparked fears that the economy could be headed for a recession and that the Federal Reserve should have lowered interest rates at its meeting on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia was down as much as 7.2% this morning, though the stock recouped some of those losses and was down 4% in afternoon trading on Friday, slightly worse than the Nasdaq Composite, which fell 3%. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nWhy Nvidia is getting hammered\n\nNvidia has led the market rally for the last year and a half as the champion of the AI boom. Its hardware has become essential to run the data centers that provide computing power for AI models like ChatGPT and the rush of other AI tools coming on the market.\n\nThe company's own business continues to grow at a breakneck pace, but investors are starting to question valuations in AI stocks, including Nvidia's, which had added more than $3 trillion in market value in little more than a year at one point. A gain of that size is unprecedented.\n\nNow, in addition to concerns about Nvidia's valuation, investors seem to have doubts about the strength of the economy, and rising unemployment could trigger a recession.\n\nAn economic downturn would likely hit the AI stock sector hard since Nvidia and its peers still trade at pricey valuations, and semiconductors are a cyclical industry. If customers slam on the brakes, the industry is going to be in trouble.\n\nHow low could Nvidia go?\n\nIt's impossible to predict short-term movements for individual stocks or even the stock market as a whole, and Nvidia has been highly volatile lately. After falling 7% on Tuesday, the stock surged 13% on Wednesday in sympathy with strong results from rival AMD. In other words, the stock can turn on a dime if the news changes.\n\nInvestors should expect the volatility to continue, and the stock could fall significantly further, though that will depend on economic data and the company's earnings report at the end of the month.\n\nNvidia's momentum as a business won't be undone easily. Tech titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have banged the drum on AI again this earnings season, saying it's essential to stay ahead of the AI curve, and that getting left behind is a greater risk.\n\nNvidia likely has several more quarters of strong growth in front of it, but a recession could upset that. At this point, keeping some cash available to take advantage of ongoing dips on the stock seems like a good strategy. While the economy could falter, Nvidia's leadership in AI hardware looks unshakable.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Fed's September Rate Cut Bets Rise: NVDA, GOLD, PHM to Gain",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve recently concluded its fifth policy meeting of 2024 and has kept the benchmark interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed kept the interest rates unaltered at 5.25% to 5.5% for the 12th successive month in July to counter the worst price pressures in 40 years.\n\nHowever, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that central bank officials are on course to lower borrowing costs in September as inflationary pressure has begun to ebb amid a cooler labor market that doesn’t overheat the economy.\n\nPowell reiterated that if prices of indispensable commodities and services continue to fall further toward the central bank’s 2% goal, then the Fed will dial back its aggressive monetary policy, and a September rate cut will be on the table.\n\nFed’s key gauge of price pressures, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index increased 2.5% year over year in June, less than May’s 2.6% yearly gain, per the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Have a look at the table: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis steady monthly slowdown in inflation from the year-ago levels prompted market participants to increase bets on a September interest rate cut. Nearly 68.5% of market participants now expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September policy meeting, up from a probability of 52% in May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The odds of a minimum of two interest rate cuts by the end of the year have also gone up.\n\nRate Cuts Are a Boon for Tech Stocks\n\nInterest rate cuts are a blessing in disguise for tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA since the inventor of GPUs’ cash flows aren’t affected and the cost of borrowing gets reduced, eventually boosting profit margins (read more: Fed Rate Cut Odds Rise: MU, NVDA, VST Stock Price to Gain).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s current-year earnings has increased 1.5% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.9%. NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGold Glitters in a Low Interest Rate Environment\n\nFixed-income investment lose their appeal in a low interest rate scenario and money flows out of such assets into gold. The price of the yellow metal climbs northward and boosts the profit margins of gold mining stocks such as Barrick Gold Corporation GOLD.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has gold mining operations in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOLD’s current-year earnings has increased 9.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 38.1% (read more: Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV).\n\nStory continues\n\nRate Cuts Work Wonders for Homebuilders\n\nHomebuilders also benefit from interest rate cuts since they reduce mortgage rates, which leads to more demand. Interest rate cuts also trim the input costs of homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. PHM.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PHM’s current-year earnings has increased 3.4% over the past 60 days. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 13.3%. PHM, at present, has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nShares of NVIDIA, Barrick Gold and PulteGroup have gained 148.4%, 11.8% and 58.7%, respectively, over the past year.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Kept Tumbling on Friday",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has more than doubled year to date. But you wouldn't know it if you just looked at the last six weeks. Nvidia shares have plunged more than 20% in that time, including another 3.4% today, as of 11:25 a.m. ET.\n\nOn the surface, today's move looks to be part of a sector rotation out of growth tech stocks and into more value-oriented and dividend names. Economic news contributing to negative investor sentiment included today's jobs report. A lower-than-expected 114,000 jobs were created in July. The unemployment rate also moved higher to 4.3%.\n\nBoth figures have investors concerned about a potential recession. That would likely stem the explosive sales growth that Nvidia has seen over the last 18 months. But there's more than just the macroeconomic picture for Nvidia investors to consider.\n\nArtificial intelligence spending grows\n\nQuarterly reports were released yesterday from tech giantsAmazon and Apple. Other recent earnings reports came from Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. All eyes were on what these companies said about capital spending related to expanding artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. Some said it shouldn't have come as a surprise to Nvidia followers, but it fueled the stock sell-off nonetheless.\n\nIn its earnings conference call with investors, Microsoft highlighted capital investments driven by AI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged spending with Nvidia, but also noted its own custom-built Azure Maia chips. While not unexpected, that has Nvidia investors concerned that competition for advanced chips will slow its own sales growth.\n\nBut AI spending still seems to be accelerating. Alphabet told investors it has the \"expectation that our capital expenditures will increase ... in particular in support of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services.\"\n\nIn fact, quarterly capital expenditures increased year over year for all the above-mentioned tech companies. The increases ranged from about 3% from Apple to more than 90% from Alphabet. Nvidia investors shouldn't worry. The company is likely to support much of that spending, as well as getting investments from other companies as demand outpaces supply.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech stocks take a pounding as hedge fund Elliott warns AI trades like Nvidia are in ‘bubble land’",
        "content": "The unwinding of the AI trade, triggered by a recent run of disappointing quarterly earnings, has turned into a bloodbath for Big Tech.\n\nWhat began with Tesla and Google has now gathered steam with selloffs spreading across all major cloud computing and semiconductor stocks, led by Intel. The chipmaker suspended its dividend on Thursday and pledged to cut 15,000 jobs, leading to today’s 27% drop—its worst for a single day in decades.\n\nSentiment worsened after the Financial Times obtained on Friday a recent letter from hedge fund Elliott Management reportedly telling investors that Nvidia and the entire megacap tech sector was living in “bubble land” with artificial intelligence “overhyped.”\n\nAlthough Nvidia may have lost more than 20% from its high in June, putting it in bear market territory, those losses only wipe out roughly two months of gains. It is still trading well above levels seen during most of May and has more than doubled in price since January, an indication that valuations may have become overextended, as Elliott warned.\n\nNvidia, whose shares traded roughly in line with the 2.7% drop in the Nasdaq, declined to comment to Fortune on the report. The asset manager couldn’t be reached.\n\nA darkening economic outlook hasn’t helped Nvidia or its peers in the chip industry either. Belief is mounting that monetary policy is overly restrictive with the overnight interbank lending rate set by the Federal Reserve last fixed at 5.33%, some 230 basis points above the June consumer price index, which measures the rate of inflation.\n\nAmazon and Tesla look to make their own AI training chips\n\nSymptomatic of a new trend to sell into strength, chip designer Arm Holdings reported on Wednesday a 39% gain in quarterly revenue, only to see it lose a quarter of its value this week alone. Growth forecasts had only met analyst expectations—a sign that the market got ahead of itself.\n\nFundamentally, little has changed for Nvidia. Its AI training and inference chips are still coveted for their unparalleled ability to crunch the terabytes of data needed to power generative AI. In fact they might even be too good. CEO Jensen Huang is struggling to keep up with the pace of demand, prompting tech companies to invest in their own microchips as a kind of plan B.\n\nElon Musk said last week that Tesla’s voracious demand for Huang’s H100 processors to power its upcoming data center in Austin means the carmaker will double down on investment in its Dojo chip. Optimized for training neural networks based on video data rather than text, Tesla hopes its proprietary design will solve autonomous driving if Nvidia cannot.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he was also funding his own chips.\n\n“We have a deep partnership with Nvidia,” Jassy told investors on Thursday. “But we’ve heard loud and clear from investors that they relish better price performance. It’s why we’ve invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Revenge Of The Rest: These Three S&P 493 Stocks Are Set To Pop\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nU.S. equities have been dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" accounting for the majority of the gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The highly esteemed group comprises seven of the largest companies in the U.S.: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese tech titans make up about a third of the index’s total value, overshadowing the performance of the other 493 companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has gained over 37% year-to-date, overshadowing the broader index's 15.8% returns over this period.\n\nCheck It Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding the potential overvaluation of the tech heavyweights have been racking investors, causing the S&P 500 index to decline by nearly 30 basis points over the past month.\n\nNonetheless, analysts are bullish on the remaining 493 stocks in the index.\n\n“So we’re seeing a diverging trend between the Magnificent Seven and the [S&P] 493 happening this quarter. The other 493 were basically in an earnings recession up until last quarter. We expect this earnings season is going to be the first quarter for the other 493 to post positive earnings growth since Q4 of ’22, whereas the Mag 7, their earnings growth is expected to decelerate for the second straight quarter and again in Q3. And by Q4 of this year consensus points to basically similar growth rates between the two and I think that will really be the catalyst for the rotation in the market to take place,” said Ohsung Kwon, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Securities.\n\nAmong the S&P 493, several dividend stocks stand out as potential winners in this expected market rotation.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has been steadily investing in its 5G network. The company added 391,000 total broadband connections in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband additions. Verizon's total broadband subscribers stood at 11.5 million as of the end of the second quarter, reflecting a 17.2% rise from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon pays $2.66 in dividends annually, yielding 6.64% on the current price. The company is currently on track to becoming a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years as of 2023.\n\n\"Our consistently disciplined approach to driving strong cash flow, operating the business, and serving our customers has once again put the Board in a position to raise the dividend,\" Verizon's Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a news release, \"We continue to deliver value to our shareholders as we execute our network-as-a-service strategy.\"\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation’s 1%.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to understand the art market dynamics.\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading pharmacy chain, had been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat until earlier this year when it slashed its quarterly dividend payouts by 48% to 25 cents per share. The company currently pays $1 per share in dividends annually, yielding 8.22% on the current price.\n\nBefore the dividend cut in January 2024, Walgreens was on track to becoming a Dividend King, having raised its dividends for 47 consecutive years.\n\nHowever, the company has been focusing on bolstering its growth prospects by expanding its health care services, including partnerships with primary care providers and investments in digital health initiatives.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to reduce our quarterly dividend payment to 25 cents per share, to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position. This action reinforces our goal of increasing cash flow while freeing up capital to invest in sustainable growth initiatives in our pharmacy and health care businesses, which we believe will ultimately improve shareholder value,\" said Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, in a news release.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical giant, has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 with its vaccine development. As of December 2023, Pfizer currently pays $1.68 in dividends annually, yielding 5.35% on the current price. The company has increased its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nHowever, as COVID-19-related growth subsides, Pfizer's earnings have been declining. The company's net income amounted to $2.33 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 98% decline year-over-year. This comes as the pandemic-driven momentum wanes, causing Pfizer's profit margins to dwindle.\n\nNonetheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise in the near term at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "content": "When it comes to the Magnificent Seven and big tech stocks, one of the ones I like the least is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as I find its business model less appealing and a little more fragile when compared to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nEven so, it is undeniable that the Google parent company has its moats and an excellent operational track record.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nAs the company is far from bad, I believe this recent dip makes the stock even more attractive, which, if it maintains its prospects of growing by double digits a year, is very cheap.\n\nIs the business model threatened?\n\nLooking at the forward price-earnings of the main Magnificent Seven companies, it is clear Alphabet stands out as the one with the lowest indicator. While the search machine is trading at 21 times its next 12 months' earnings, companies like Microsoft and Apple are already over 30, not to mention Amazon and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which add further distortion to this comparison. Even Meta (NASDAQ:META), which in recent history had the lowest multiples, has overtaken the tech giant.\n\nNote that although Alphabet has never stood out as a company that is traded with a rich multiple, in many periods it was much closer to the other companies, and only in recent months has this gap opened up. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nGOOGL Data by GuruFocus\n\nOf course, there is a reason for this. Even though the market often acts in a dysfunctional way, this would hardly happen without a plausible justification, especially for one of the world's largest companies. The main reason for the stock trading at this level, while maintaining an expectation of double-digit sales growth, is the threat to its main business, Google Search.\n\nIn the second quarter, the search tool accounted for 57% of the group's revenue, while other initiatives such as YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud were closer to 10% each. Even with this dependence, credit must be given to Alphabet, which over the years has built up a complete and diversified business model. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nAccording to some bears, Google's search model could be disrupted or slowed down by large language models. Today, the most common thing when you want to go to a restaurant or have a question is to go to the search engine and type it in. One of the narratives suggests this could easily be replaced by a question to your chatbot, be it GPT Chat, Alexa or Siri. If, instead of searching, many people start using these other methods, search becomes less relevant and directly impacts the company's revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy take tends toward skepticism. However long it takes for this narrative to materialize, instead of completely disrupting Google Search, it may only be something that will add obstacles, reducing growth rather than bringing about a stagnation or decrease in this line of revenue in the short and medium term. Artificial intelliegence will gradually become more popular, but to reach a considerable mass of the population that adopts it in their daily lives and replaces their habits of using Google search as a tool could take years.\n\nAs Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, even if this happens gradually, the company will be able to balance it with growth at other ends, whether in the cloud, through YouTube or a new line of revenue with Gemini. There is a range of options that bring an interesting vision and can help sustain this growth in the long run.\n\nStick with the fundamentals\n\nIn many cases, investors tend to turn something simple into something complex. While this can sometimes be necessary, especially in technology segments that are very dynamic and the outlook changes all the time, overcomplicating something and getting carried away with the narrative is a very common mistake.\n\nTrying to look at it pragmatically, in a stick with the fundamentals analysis, Alphabet is still an excellent company. In the breakdown of revenue, you can see that search revenue and Google Play advanced by 14% year over year, YouTube by 13% and Google Cloud by 29%. Alphabet is far from a dying business. Even with this growth, the miss in YouTube ad revenue disappointed the market, which together with the higher capital expenditures, caused the stock to fall post-earnings.\n\nBut it does not stop there. As well as having a growth rank of 10 on the GF Score, its profitability rank is also solid at 10. Its financial strength is also very good with cash on hand of over $100 billion. In terms of profitability, it is worth highlighting a net margin of 26.70% as well as a return on invested capital of 32.50%, which shows a cash cow business model and assertive capital allocation. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nHow about the future?\n\nAlphabet's capital allocation is very good as it has robust cash on hand, which could eventually turn into another successful acquisition like YouTube, or reinvestment in the business that is transformed to at least remain relevant in industries like search, AI and cloud. In the second quarter, the company made capital expenditures of more than $13 billion to cope with a robust infrastructure that supports the advancement of Google Cloud, Google Search and other businesses through data centers, but it put pressure on free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a risk that search will be affected, this is not a trend that seems likely to occur in the medium term. As already mentioned, this depends on the mass replacement and adoption of a new tool by the population. In the short and medium term, this technological evolution could bring greater assertiveness to ads and searches, boosting this market as a positive trend.\n\nWhen it comes to competition, although Google has recently lost ground to Bing (Microsoft's search engine), Alphabet still has a virtual monopoly, with more than 80% of the search market according to Statista. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: Statista\n\nIn this way, the future for search is partly cloudy, but it does not seem so uncertain that it can be labeled a dying business.\n\nEverything has a price\n\nIn addition to the multiples, which became even more attractive after the recent dip, other methods reinforce that Alphabet's stock is at a level that will remunerate shareholders well. If we run a reverse discounted cash flow model using earnings per share, projecting growth of 15% per year for the next 10 years and 10% for the following decade, we find the current share price by discounting at a rate of 12%. In other words, if the company manages to achieve greater growth than this, the annual return for the shareholder would be above 12%, making the stock a real compounder.\n\nThis becomes even more interesting when we look at the last five years, where the earnings per share compound annual growth rate has been 25.90%. Although the company does not need to maintain this level consistently, it is possible that positive surprises could happen along the way so that EPS growth could exceed the projected 10% to 15% per year. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nIf we use more reasonable assumptions to try to find a fair price, it is still possible to find an interesting upside. With 18% in the first 10 years and 8% in the last 10, discounting by 11% (still a high and restrictive figure for a company of such quality), we would have a fair value of $212 per share, equivalent to an upside of 21%. I used EPS instead of free cash flow because of the recent history of high capex, which would negatively bias the reverse DCF model.\n\nAccording to the GF Value Line, the stock should be worth around $155, which currently qualifies it as fairly valued, showing that although Alphabet is much cheaper than its tech peers, it's still not a huge bargain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAlphabet still has relevant moats and is not a dying business. For this reason, even though there is a certain cloudiness to some parts of its business model, the discrepancy between the premium for companies like Apple and Microsoft seems to have become very large, while there is a discount on the Google parent's shares that makes it more attractive, especially after this dip.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Semiconductor company and artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) might just be the most well-known company on the planet right now. Considering the enormous role Nvidia plays in the AI movement, it seems like the entire technology sector hinges on how Nvidia's business is performing.\n\nSo far in 2024, Nvidia has grown its market cap by 127% -- currently hovering around $2.8 trillion. Nevertheless, one Wall Street analyst in particular is sounding the alarm and calling for even more growth.\n\nHans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities recently increased his price target for Nvidia to $200 per share. Should Nvidia reach this price, it would imply a market cap of $5 trillion.\n\nLet's dig into how AI is transforming Nvidia and why I see the stock as a no-brainer opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nAI is transforming the technology industry\n\nAI is a pretty broad term. Moreover, while AI is of high interest at the moment, the technology has existed in some form or fashion for decades.\n\nIn late 2022 when OpenAI released its large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, to the world, it was perhaps the first time in modern history that AI-powered applications entered the mainstream. As such, businesses and people in general were captivated by the potential of generative AI and quickly found ways to implement the technology into their daily lives.\n\nAlthough AI can take many forms, one of the biggest pillars in propping up its development is semiconductor chips. This is where Nvidia comes into play. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow Nvidia is disrupting AI\n\nWhen Nvidia was founded nearly 30 years ago, its primary mission was to augment graphics for video games. While gaming is still a part of Nvidia's business, the company has branched out into other areas over the last several years.\n\nNamely, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are sophisticated semiconductor chips that are used for a wide variety of AI-driven applications such as machine learning, quantum computing, and even autonomous driving.\n\nToday, the majority of Nvidia's revenue and profits stems from its chip and data center business.\n\nAlthough hardware is currently Nvidia's bread and butter, the company has also quietly built a budding enterprise software business. Nvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) software is meant to be used alongside the chips when developing AI products.\n\nNvidia faces fierce competition in the chip realm from the likes of AMD, Intel, and even some big tech stalwarts including Amazon and Meta. As competition increases, Nvidia will likely eventually begin to witness a slowdown from its chip operation and it'll be increasingly difficult for the company to command such immense pricing power for several more years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, if Nvidia's revenue and gross margin profile start to decelerate, the high-margin aspect of its CUDA software business should help mitigate any potential deteriorating growth in the hardware operation.\n\nLastly, Nvidia has also made a number of splashy investments related to AI. In particular, the company is an investor in enterprise software start-up Databricks and humanoid robotics company Figure AI.\n\nI see both of these moves as savvy choices by Nvidia, as each provides the company with ample opportunities to penetrate the chip and software businesses further.\n\nIs Nvidia headed to $5 trillion?\n\nWhether Nvidia will reach a $5 trillion valuation is somewhat moot. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's an exercise in false precision. The ideas explored above shed light on where Nvidia's business is today, and where it could be headed as AI continues to be further integrated across industry sectors and product types.\n\nFortunately, I think Nvidia has an incredibly bright future backed by its robust end-to-end AI platform featuring hardware, data centers, and software. The chart below illustrates Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratios over the last three years. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe interesting thing to point out here is that both Nvidia's P/E and P/FCF ratios are well off their highs and essentially flat compared to three years ago.\n\nConsidering the company has changed dramatically over just the last couple of years, and the transformation prospects that AI presents, there's an argument to be made that Nvidia stock is cheaper today than it was three years ago -- and that its full potential in AI is not already priced into the stock.\n\nI see Nvidia as a generational opportunity and well-positioned to continue succeeding across many areas of the AI landscape for the long term. I think investors have a lucrative opportunity to scoop up shares of one of the tech sector's most prolific AI businesses in Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Practically everyone building an artificial intelligence (AI) large language model relies on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and others have been committing billions of dollars to Nvidia just to get their hands on the next batch of chips.\n\nBut Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), true to its roots, thinks differently.\n\nThe company revealed its long-awaited AI features in early June. It's calling the system Apple Intelligence, which consists of multiple generative AI models fine-tuned for various tasks, such as writing, summarizing, image generation, and interacting with iPhone and Mac apps. But those models weren't trained using Nvidia GPUs. They weren't trained using GPUs at all. Nvidia HQ. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBuilding the Apple Foundation Model\n\nApple used Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train its Apple Foundation Models, which power Apple Intelligence. A TPU is a special type of computer chip called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC. Unlike a GPU, an ASIC chip is relatively limited in what kind of processes it can run. But it runs those processes extremely efficiently.\n\nApple used the fourth and fifth generations of Google's TPUs to train its foundation models. Google says the TPU v5p, released late last year, is 2.8 times faster than the fourth-generation design. And Google's TPU v4 was between 1.2 times and 1.7 times faster than the Nvidia A100. Some back-of-the-envelope math then puts the v5p chips on par with Nvidia's latest H100 chips. In May, Google introduced its sixth-generation TPU, which produces even more speed improvements.\n\nIn other words, when it comes to training a foundation model for generative AI, Google's own designs appear to be just as good as Nvidia's latest hardware. More importantly, they're more energy- and cost-efficient than using a GPU. As a result, Apple can end up with a foundation model for Apple Intelligence at a fraction of the price it would've cost to use Nvidia's chips.\n\nApple certainly isn't the only company using Google TPUs for training its AI, but the fact that one of the wealthiest companies in the world decided to go with TPUs over Nvidia should send a major warning to Nvidia investors.\n\nGoogle isn't the only one making AI chips\n\nNvidia relies on a small group of tech giants for a large part of its business. Google is one of its biggest customers despite the fact that it's spent a decade designing its own AI chips. Likewise, Nvidia's other biggest customers -- Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta -- are all designing their own custom silicon for training and running AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai may have summarized the biggest reason these companies continue to purchase every chip they can from Nvidia on his company's second-quarter earnings call. \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us.\" In other words, the potential loss from not spending heavily on AI chips and data centers is far greater than the cost of spending.\n\nBut ultimately, Google TPUs and other custom silicon may prove a more cost-effective way to continue scaling the AI businesses of these tech giants. And Apple's decision to use TPUs is a major testament to that.\n\nCustomer concentration is a major risk for Nvidia. During Q1, two customers accounted for 24% of its total revenue. As these customers work to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, the chip designer could see its revenue growth slow significantly over the next few years.\n\nConsidering the expectations for Nvidia are high, that makes the potential for more AI developers to use cost-effective ASICs instead of Nvidia GPUs a serious threat to the stock price. One bad quarter could send shares considerably lower.\n\nEven after the pullback in price, Nvidia shares trade for over 42 times forward earnings and an enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of around 34. Both are extremely high for a company of its size, and while it's managed to beat expectations amid the ongoing AI boom, the potential for a slowdown in sales and profits keeps getting stronger. Nvidia's AI dominance won't last forever, but investors are acting like it will, based on its current share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Germany could account for more than half of the combined hydrogen import demand across Europe, reported EnergyCentral.com. Even the U.K. says hydrogen is critical for its transition to net zero by 2050.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn short, go long on hydrogen stocks. There’s a good deal of potential growth ahead.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned Linde (NASDAQ:LIN), I said it was “another powerhouse hydrogen stock to buy on weakness. After testing a high of about $480, rebounding shares of LIN are now back around $444. From here, I’d like to see it retest $480 near-term.”\n\nThat was on July 25, as LIN traded at $444. Today, it’s up to $453.50 and still a buy.\n\nBetter, while we wait for further upside, we can collect its $1.39 quarterly dividend, payable Sept. 18 to shareholders of record as of Sept. 4.\n\nAlso, from its last traded price of $453.50, I’d still like to see it test $480, which could happen if second-quarter earnings growth and guidance are solid on Aug. 2.\n\nIn its first quarter report, its EPS of $3.75 beat by 8 cents, with revenue of $8.1 billion missing by $276.48 million.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is another one of the top hydrogen stocks to buy and hold.\n\nFor one, the company will benefit from artificial intelligence data center energy demand, especially as it deploys fuel cells for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)-backed CoreWeave.\n\nThe order from CoreWeave is for “a significant amount of power for CoreWeave to power high-density GPU workloads years ahead of waiting for the utility to upgrade service,” as noted by Barron’s.\n\nTwo, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) believes “Bloom is one of the most underappreciated ways to play the Powering AI theme.” Three, as also noted by Barron’s, fuel cells offer the reliability that AI data centers demand, which puts Bloom in the “sweet spot.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMoving forward, we’ll get a better idea of what’s happening at Bloom when the company posts second-quarter earnings on Aug. 8 after the closing bell.\n\nDefiance Next Gen H2 ETF (HDRO) An image of a hexagon structure with the text H2 Hydrogen on a blue background\n\nSource: Alexander Limbach / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify on the cheap, there’s the Defiance Next Gen H2 ETF (NYSEARCA:HDRO).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.30%, the ETF holds 32 stocks, which derive at least 50% of their revenue from hydrogen-based energy sources. That includes Bloom Energy, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP), Linde and Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) — to name just a few. Investors get all those and more for about $5.02 a share.\n\nIf I wanted to buy 100 shares, it would cost me just over $500, which is far better than paying $45,350 for 100 shares of just one of its holdings — in this case, Linde.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "The Top 3 Blockchain Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "Investing in blockchain stocks may elicit a hard pass from some investors who believe that this is a gateway into cryptocurrency. It is used in peer-to-peer transactions that are one of the core tenets of digital currency. But the potential of blockchain technology goes well beyond Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nOne of the best ways to understand blockchain is that it gives individuals and organizations a way to store and secure, their data without relying on a third party. That’s what a decentralized environment means. As Divya Premkumar summarized for InvestorPlace, blockchain, “…has created a paradigm shift in how we own and manage data while redefining traditional business models.”\n\nThis paradigm shift is why the sector is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 52.8% between now and 2032. And it’s why you should be thinking about ways to invest in blockchain stocks that still allow you to own stocks that fit your broader investment philosophy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the reasons to believe that blockchain technology is the future is that a company like Visa (NYSE:V) has so readily adopted it. This is about how money is likely to move in the future. And companies like Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) didn’t want to be left behind.\n\nCryptocurrency is a big part of the story. After all, Visa’s revenue stream is based on transactions. It didn’t want to be on the outside looking in when it comes to the integration of blockchain and crypto. In fact, Visa has an entire section of its website aimed at “Unlocking Crypto Opportunities” for businesses.\n\nMy point is, owning V stock makes sense for many investors, even without blockchain. The 10-year total return on V stock is 440%. And its investment in blockchain is proof of concept for the technology and another reason to believe that this is a stock that will be there for you when you need it in the future.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother pick among blockchain stocks that doesn’t require you to get out of your comfort zone is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company is an e-commerce giant that’s also known for its Amazon Web Services (AWS). That’s where the company is making strides in artificial intelligence. And it’s also where the company has an emerging blockchain story.\n\nThe AWS platform is the home of Amazon Managed Blockchain that includes free blockchain training as an AWS Skill Builder. It’s an opportunity for AWS customers to create and manage a personal blockchain network.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, that’s an area left to clients using Web3 projects. But in the future, there will likely be opportunities to use blockchain in the company’s legacy e-commerce business.\n\nThe takeaway for investors is, like Visa, there are many reasons to own AMZN stock today that have nothing to do with blockchain. But Amazon appears to be in a unique position to drive revenue from this technology in the coming years.\n\nGlobal X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) Illustration of an ETF in multiple sectors.\n\nSource: SWKStock / Shutterstock\n\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) have their place in a portfolio. When it comes to investing in blockchain stocks, the Global X Blockchain ETF (NASDAQ:BKCH) is one of the leading options. The fund was launched in 2021 and has over $122 million in assets under management (AUM).\n\nIt has 27 holdings as of July 31, 2024 and 69% of the fund’s holdings are from U.S.-based companies. But some of these are not household names. For example, you won’t find Visa or Amazon in this fund’s holdings. But you do get exposure to NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) which will be needed in the buildout of the technology.\n\nThe fund gained of over 33% in the last 12 months, but it is down over 40% since its inception. That should give you confidence that it’s a fund with plenty of upside. Plus, it has a reasonable 0.50% expense ratio and even pays a dividend that currently yields 2.76%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is facing a probe from the U.S. Department of Justice over complaints its rivals that the chipmaker is abusing its market dominance in developing advanced chips for artificial intelligence, according to a report by The Information on Thursday.\n\nNvidia stock fell 3.6% in premarket trading Friday, extending its losses from a day prior.\n\nU.S. officials had reached out to several Nvidia competitors, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), to investigate complaints over potential antitrust activities, The Information reported, citing two sources involved in the discussions.\n\nComplaints included allegations that the chipmaker was threatening to punish customers who bought products from its rivals, as well as antitrust concerns over the firm’s acquisition of AI startups to strengthen its hold on the industry.\n\nThe report comes just after a report from Politico earlier in the day showed Nvidia was facing an antitrust investigation over its acquisition of Run:ai in late-April.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said \"NVIDIA wins on merit... We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws.\"\n\nThe firm produces the most advanced chips used to run artificial intelligence programs, and saw a massive valuation spike over the past year as it benefited from increasing interest in AI.\n\nBut Nvidia’s dominance in the sector has called into question whether the firm is potentially skirting antitrust regulations.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, reports also showed that U.S. progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren called on the DOJ to investigate Nvidia over anti-competitive behavior.\n\nAmbar Warrick contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia stock slips on reports of DOJ antitrust probe\n\nChevron misses earnings expectations on lower refining margins\n\nGoogle owner reduced its stake in CrowdStrike prior to global outage, filings show\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere’s a spending frenzy around AI, and this earnings season we’ve been getting more details on the pace of that outlay.\n\nMeta raised its capital expenditures forecast to the range of $37 billion to $40 billion. Microsoft spent $19 billion last quarter, including server farm leases. Amazon spent $30 billion so far this year and says it’ll kick it up a notch to close out 2024. Apple may be zagging, but clearly has a fresh AI focus of its own.\n\nWe’ve been told that generative AI is the next smartphone, the next internet — a transformational technology. That’s why these companies have ramped up spending in a generative AI-building arms race.\n\nThey’re spending because they believe in it, of course.\n\nBut is the spending also influencing that belief? Are the stakes now so high that even if the promise of generative AI doesn’t meet those lofty expectations, these companies, and their clients, will try to shoehorn it into products and processes where it’s not really needed?\n\nHistory is littered with “transformational” technologies that didn’t quite make the grade.\n\nDigital assistants, for example, like Amazon’s Alexa. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a former senior employee as saying, “We worried we’ve hired 10,000 people and we’ve built a smart timer.” Apple was reportedly spending $1 billion annually to develop a supposedly industry-changing vehicle before abandoning that effort earlier this year.\n\nOf course, a moonshot effort like the car was a sideline to Apple’s main business and hardly a lottery ticket for the company. It seems more so for Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, even Tesla, which are putting AI front and center in their pitch to investors. They’re motivated to make it work.\n\nAnd make it work quickly. Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn called the infrastructure build a “cycle of competitive escalation” in a recent piece, positing that the hyperscalers would move much more slowly, and perhaps rationally, if not on each other’s heels.\n\nThe ensuing digestion period has already likely begun, if investors’ impatient reaction to Microsoft’s earnings is any indication. Meta, on the other hand, “continues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI,” wrote JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth in reaction to its numbers.\n\nAs he pointed out, “Management continues to expect Meta AI to become the most used AI assistant by the end of 2024, & open source Llama 3.1 should support a faster pace of innovation, better social/advertiser experiences, & cost benefits.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIs that transformational? Expect to continue to hear that it is, or will be. It has to — because they’re writing the checks.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Will Make You Even Happier Than Nvidia",
        "content": "Artificial Intelligence is a buzzword of the year and it is heard the most during the earnings season. Each earnings season sees companies talking about their AI investments, goals, and the future of this sector. With companies spending billions in the segment, it is hard to stay away from it. Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional, holding AI stocks can be a game changer. However, it is time we moved on from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and looked at other stocks that have the same potential.\n\nIt may not be possible for Nvidia to repeat the rally but other stocks are steadily moving higher. These companies are a big part of the AI race and could become industry leaders. I’ve identified three stocks that are yet to hit gold, but they are steadily and slowly moving upwards. Their AI investments are paying off and these three companies could make you happier than Nvidia. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nAI Stocks to Buy: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been pounding the table on Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), and while many investors think it is priced at a premium, I think it is aptly priced. But if you miss out on this buying opportunity, you may have to pay a premium for it. Trading for $26, the stock is up 62% year-to-date and is set to hit a new 52-week high soon. PLTR is one of the best AI stocks to own.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company is leading the AI race with its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) which has attracted several commercial clients. Palantir is known to be the preferred choice of the government and it has bagged several contracts from the defence sector. It recently received a $650 million contract from the U.S. Army.\n\nGovernment contracts ensure steady revenue generation. However, Palantir has now diversified into the commercial sector, and saw a 69% year-over-year jump in commercial clients in the first quarter. Its revenue stood at $634 million, and the EPS came in at $0.04. For the second quarter, it is aiming for revenue in the range of $649 to $653 million.\n\nWedbush analysts have an outperform rating for the stock, and the analysts see Palantir as well-positioned in the industry to be able to capitalize on the $1 trillion AI spending push. The analysts have a price target of $30. Citi analysts are optimistic about the upcoming results and consider Palantir a standout performer. The company is set to report results on August 5 and it could take the stock higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 34% YTD and 18% in the past 12 months, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock is exchanging hands for $139. A legacy player and one of the top AI stocks, Oracle has seen several ups and downs but has remained steady even during the market uncertainty. It already enjoys a strong reputation for its legacy database systems.\n\nOracle is the biggest beneficiary of companies shifting towards the cloud. It is building 100 data centers and has seen impressive growth in the data center revenue. In the fourth-quarter results, the cloud revenue jumped 20% YOY to $5.3 billion and its total revenue was up 3% to $14.3 billion.\n\nOracle’s outstanding performance obligations stood at $98 billion, up 44% YOY. This shows that the company will be converting the outstanding obligations into revenue in the coming quarters and the balance sheet will only get stronger. While the stock is trading at a premium, its potential is equally high.\n\nOracle has partnerships with some of the top tech companies in the industry including Nvidia and Palantir. These partnerships can drive growth. It could be a win-win for both companies. It entered into a partnership with OpenAI last month where ChatGPT will use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure. The steady growth in deals show that the industry sees Oracle as a very strong industry player and one that can stand the test of time.\n\nLooking at the long-term picture, I believe Oracle is a solid AI bet with massive upside potential.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is another AI industry player that helps clients run applications. The platform offers AI-powered software to government and commercial clients. It is a subscription-based model and the steady growth in subscriptions ensures steady revenue growth. The company saw a 20% YOY jump in revenue in the recent quarter and has signed new deals on the commercial side. With a massive rise in the cloud computing market, C3.ai is set to benefit.\n\nDespite the fundamentals and steady subscription revenue growth, the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation. It is exchanging hands for $26 at the time of writing and has dropped 6% since the beginning of the year. This dip is a chance to buy the gem. The reason behind the dip is the profitability. C3.ai reported an operating loss but managed to generate a positive free cash flow.\n\nI believe the company has the power to turn around very soon and it enjoys a solid momentum in closing deals. This is a good sign about the future of the company. It saw a 62% YOY jump in cloud partnerships and signed 115 deals in fiscal year 2024. If it continues to win more deals at the same pace, it could hit new highs this year.\n\nThe AI space is highly competitive but C3.ai has set itself apart with its product and with the same momentum, it could reap impressive returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For nearly two years, Wall Street has been entrenched in a sensational bull market. In recent weeks, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh record-closing highs.\n\nWhile there are a number of catalysts responsible for pushing the broader market to new heights, including a resilient U.S. economy and better-than-expected operating results for Wall Street's most-influential businesses, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is firmly at the top of the list.\n\nWith AI, software and systems oversee tasks that would normally have been assigned to humans. What gives this technology such immense appeal -- the analysts at PwC estimate a $15.7 trillion boost from AI to the global economy by 2030 -- is the capacity for AI-driven software and systems to learn and evolve without human intervention. Machine learning gives AI utility in pretty much every sector and industry. Nvidia's stock has soared -- but the music may be about to stop. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen next-big-thing technologies come along, professional and everyday investors aren't shy about bidding up the valuations of the companies behind them. Without question, no company has benefited more from the AI revolution than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nAt its peak, Nvidia's stock gained more than $3 trillion in market value\n\nBeginning in early 2023, Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) became the preferred choice for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models. The semiconductor analysts at TechInsights have estimated that Nvidia accounted for all but 90,000 of the 3.85 million GPUs shipped to high-compute data centers last year.\n\nHaving a veritable monopoly on the hardware powering decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers is an enviable place to be. With demand for the company's chips easily outstripping their supply, Nvidia has had no trouble meaningfully increasing the price of its H100 GPUs and pumping up its adjusted gross margin.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia isn't sitting on its laurels when it comes to innovation. Even though its H100 GPU has clear compute advantages over its rivals, Nvidia is set to roll out its next-generation GPU platform, known as Blackwell, in the latter-half of this year. In June, CEO Jensen Huang also teased the potential of its Rubin architecture, which is slated to hit the market by 2026. It would appear that Nvidia has a blueprint to retain its compute advantage in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nThis textbook operating expansion allowed Nvidia's valuation to catapult from $360 billion, when the curtain opened in 2023, to a peak of almost $3.5 trillion on an intra-day basis on June 20. For a brief moment, Nvidia became the most-valuable publicly traded company in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen the music slowed...\n\nNvidia's stock has plunged 26% in six weeks and may be headed much lower\n\nSince peaking at $140.76 on an intra-day basis, shares of Nvidia have plunged by 26% to $103.73, as of the closing bell on July 30. In roughly six weeks, Wall Street's AI darling has shed in the neighborhood of $900 billion in market value, which is higher than the market cap of 493 out of the 500 companies that comprise the S&P 500.\n\nAlthough stocks don't move up or down in a straight line, history suggests that Nvidia may have a lot further to fall.\n\nOver the last three decades, Wall Street has entertained no shortage of perceived-to-be game-changing innovations, technologies, and trends. This includes the advent of the internet, genome decoding, business-to-business commerce, housing, China stocks, nanotechnology, 3D printing, cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, legalized cannabis, augmented/virtual reality, the metaverse, and now artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough market leaders for every trend listed above enjoyed parabolic moves higher in the early going, the music and euphoria eventually stopped. While some of these innovations went on to be wildly successful for patient investors (the internet), others flopped and never recovered (3D printing and cannabis).\n\nThe key point here is that all new technologies, trends, and innovations need to time to mature. While a $15.7 trillion addressable market probably sounds great on paper, the reality right now is that a majority of businesses lack a game plan for how they'll utilize AI to generate additional sales and grow their profits.\n\nThe one constant for next-big-thing innovations is an overestimation of uptake, adoption, and utility by the investing community -- and this includes Wall Street analysts and institutions. Every last trend I mentioned above endured a bubble-bursting event in its early stages, and there's nothing to suggest that AI won't follow suit.\n\nMarket-leading businesses tied to the advent of the internet, business-to-business commerce, genome decoding, cannabis, and cryptocurrency all plunged around 90%, or more, following the bursting of their respective bubbles. Meanwhile, the face of the metaverse, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), dipped by 80% before finding its nadir.\n\nMeta Platforms enjoyed a firmer foundation because it had its established social media assets to lean on in the event that the hype surrounding the metaverse disappeared. Meta generates approximately 98% of its revenue from advertising, and no social sites draw anywhere close to the number of daily active users that it can.\n\nNvidia offers similarities in that it has an established GPU businesses for data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency miners, along with virtualization software and automotive/robotics solutions. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, these established segments should keep Nvidia's stock from experiencing a decline of 90% or more, as we witnessed with other next-big-thing innovations.\n\nNevertheless, history is quite clear that bubble-bursting events are unkind to market leaders behind next-big-thing trends. A decline of 80% for Nvidia isn't just a possibility -- it's the expectation given what history tell us. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHeadwinds are mounting for Wall Street's AI darling\n\nTo make matters worse, history isn't the only headwind Wall Street's AI darling is contending with.\n\nBeginning in the second half of this year, Intel is expected to roll out its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerating chip on a wide-scale basis. This coincides with Advanced Micro Devices continuing to up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is considerably cheaper than the H100 on a cost basis. Even if Intel's and AMD's chips remain inferior, in terms of compute capabilities, Nvidia's inability to meet overwhelming enterprise demand will open the door for Intel and AMD to fill the void.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (which are all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are internally developing AI chips for their respective data centers. Though it's unlikely these GPUs are going to outperform Nvidia's, they're notably cheaper than Nvidia's chips and will be taking up valuable data center \"real estate\" in the coming months, quarters, and years. The implication being that Nvidia's GPU sales to America's most-influential businesses have peaked.\n\nWe're already seeing evidence that Nvidia's market share dominance is set to wane. After reporting an adjusted gross margin of 78.35% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28), the company guided to an adjusted gross margin of 75.5% (+/- 50 basis points) for the fiscal second quarter. Even though Nvidia's margins have meaningfully expanded over the last 18 months, the first (forecast) sequential decline since 2022 suggests that the AI scarcity responsible for pushing GPU prices higher is about to dwindle.\n\nIt could be just a matter of time before Nvidia loses its trillion-dollar market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Asian Chip Stock Leadership Shifts as Samsung Grabs AI Spotlight",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A change is afoot in Asian chip stock leadership, as South Korean memory maker SK Hynix Inc. pares its big gain for the year on the global rotation out of overheated artificial intelligence winners.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Reporter to Be Freed by Russia in Major Prisoner Swap Kamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Ackman’s IPO Dream Implodes From $25 Billion to Zero in Weeks While ‘Pod Save America’ Tries to Unite Democrats, Its Staff Rebels Stocks Sink Before Jobs as Tech Hit on Earnings: Markets Wrap\n\nAt the same time, foreign investor buying of Samsung Electronics Co. has driven its shares higher. That comes as the company is expected to win more business with key AI chip designer Nvidia Corp.\n\nThe gap between the two stocks is likely to at least “soften” from here, as SK Hynix shares appear set to decline more sharply, said Roh Jongwon, chief investment officer at Infinity Global Asset Management. “SK Hynix absolutely outperformed Samsung Electronics so far this year, but the higher the mountains, the deeper the valley.”\n\nSamsung was the only gainer last month on a six-member Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of memory-related stocks, rising nearly 3% while SK Hynix and Micron Technology Inc. fell more than 16% each. SK Hynix shares tumbled more than 10% Friday as the global tech selloff extended, while Samsung’s dipped 4.1%.\n\nSK Hynix rose quickly to become the dominant supplier of high-bandwidth memory chips that work in conjunction with AI accelerators. Samsung has been making progress, however, saying this week that it expects to sharply increase its HBM output. It anticipates approval from Nvidia for its next-generation HBM3E chip in two to four months, Bloomberg News reported.\n\n“From Nvidia’s perspective, it cannot meet demand with supplies from SK Hynix only,” said Jung In Yun, chief executive officer at Fibonacci Asset Management Global. “Once Samsung passes the qualification test from Nvidia, its revenues next year will grow explosively,” he said, adding that it’s time to increase bullish exposure to the stock.\n\nOverseas funds — which account for a large portion of daily trading in Asian markets — have begun to position for a shift. Foreign investors sold $1.5 billion worth of SK Hynix shares on a net basis in July, their first withdrawal in three months, while adding $2 billion worth of Samsung.\n\nSamsung may be gaining at the expense of AI chip stocks outside of Korea as well, as global funds sold a net $5.8 billion of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. shares last month. TSMC fell 3.3% in July, its first monthly loss since last September.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be sure, sell-side analysts remain bullish on both Korean memory makers, with 41 buy recommendations on SK Hynix versus 39 for Samsung.\n\nEven after posting its worst monthly drop since 2011, SK Hynix still looks “slightly overvalued,” according to Kazunori Ito, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Ito has the only sell recommendation on SK Hynix.\n\n“SK Hynix’s share price has been too optimistic as expectations for AI server demand were too high,” Ito said. “We continue to prefer Samsung Electronics over SK Hynix due to the lower valuation, and if Samsung succeeds in passing Nvidia’s qualification test for HBM3E, it will be the catalyst to narrow the valuation gap.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nApple Inc. predicted that its new artificial intelligence features will spur iPhone upgrades in coming months, helping the company reemerge from a sales slowdown that has hit its China business especially hard. Amazon.com Inc., risking Wall Street’s displeasure, told investors that profits for now will take a back seat to heavy spending on artificial intelligence. Intel Corp. plunged more than 19% after delivering a barrage of startling news, including a grim growth forecast and plans to slash 15,000 jobs, in the latest sign that the chipmaker is ill-equipped to compete in the artificial intelligence era.\n\n--With assistance from John Cheng and Sangmi Cha.\n\n(Updates Friday’s price moves in fourth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Sank Today -- Is It Time to Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Volatility continued for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock in Thursday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share ended the daily session down 6.7%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAfter posting big gains Wednesday, Nvidia stock initially looked poised to see another day of gains thanks to strong demand indicators following the publication of Meta Platforms' Q2 results and guidance. But macroeconomic concerns took center stage for the broader stock market, and the highlighting of related risk factors drove big sell-offs for the chip specialist.\n\nNvidia stock has been in topsy-turvy mode lately\n\nNvidia's pullback today comes on the heels of even bigger gains on Wednesday. Microsoft issued encouraging capital expenditures and AI investment guidance with its recent quarterly report. Advanced Micro Devices also published Q2 results that showed demand for data center processors was high.\n\nInvestors were also feeling bullish ahead of expectations that yesterday's Federal Reserve meeting would signal that an interest rate cut is coming in September. In response, Nvidia's market capitalization increased $330 billion on Wednesday -- the biggest-ever daily gain for a company.\n\nThe rally almost looked poised to continue Thursday. Encouraging capex guidance and commentary from Meta Platforms gave Nvidia stock a boost in pre-market and early daily trading, but the gains faded as an uptick in bearish sentiment for the overall stock market took hold.\n\nWhile the Fed's July meeting signaled that the much-anticipated interest rate cut will likely arrive next month, some economists are seeing increased risk of recession due to a recent increase in jobless claims and other factors. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones indexes fell roughly 1.4%, 2.3, and 1.2%, respectively. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAfter Thursday's sell-off, Nvidia is trading at roughly 40 times this year's expected earnings and 22 times expected sales. Notably, the company's price-to-earnings ratio is less than two times the company's price-to-sales ratio, which reflects the stellar profit margins the business has been serving up lately. But it's still a high-risk, high-reward stock.\n\nAided by ongoing demand for AI technologies, Nvidia will likely continue to post strong sales and earnings growth for the rest of the year and in 2025 -- but the outlook is a bit murkier further out. The company's business has historically been shaped by cyclical trends, and it's not entirely clear what stage we're at in the current artificial intelligence investment cycle, and what macro backdrop will emerge.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, the long-term outlook for AI-related hardware and services demand remains incredibly promising. If you're looking to build positions in artificial intelligence and are willing to embrace near-term volatility, taking advantage of pullbacks in Nvidia could be worthwhile.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $717,050!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

In a release, Intel said it expects Q3 revenue of between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, well short of analysts' expectations of $14.3 billion.\n\nShares of the chip maker plummeted more than 16% on the news.\n\nIntel is in the midst of a massive turnaround effort as it seeks to regain market share lost to rival AMD (AMD) while working to build out its AI chip and third-party foundry businesses. All of this comes as the PC market is in the early stages of a recovery after eight consecutive quarters of declines following the explosive growth the industry experienced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.02 on revenue of $12.8 billion. Analysts were looking for EPS of $0.10 and revenue of $12.9 billion.

        "title": "3 Promising Tech Stocks to Buy After Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "Major technology companies needed strong Q2 earnings. In the lead-up to the first prints of the mega-cap tech names, the Nasdaq Composite index tanked, declining more than 2% in a single day and worsening the rotation out of technology stocks that have been ongoing since the year’s second half began in July.\n\nThe good news is that the results, so far, have been quite good. Prints from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have managed to beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines, prompting a relief rally in the market. The day after Microsoft’s Q2 results were announced, the Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.55% (more than 400 points).\n\nHowever, it has not just been the mega-cap tech companies that have announced better-than-expected Q2 earnings. Several tech companies have been surprised by the upside, helping tech stocks to recover. Here are three promising tech stocks to buy after Q2 earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is credited with reviving the entire microchip sector with its Q2 print. AMD stock rose 5% after the semiconductor company reported financial results that showed accelerating sales of its artificial intelligence (AI) microchips. Other chip stocks did even better, with shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) rising 10% the day after AMD’s Q2 earnings report.\n\nAMD announced EPS of 69 cents, which topped Wall Street forecasts of 68 cents. Revenue totaled $5.84 billion, ahead of consensus expectations of $5.72 billion. The strong results were attributed to sales of the company’s AI chips, with sales of its new MI300X chip exceeding $1 billion during the quarter. Owing to the brisk Q2 sales, AMD raised its projection for sales of its AI chips this year, saying it now expects revenue to exceed $4.50 billion in 2024. Last fall, AMD forecasted 2024 AI chip sales of $2 billion.\n\nAMD’s AI chip sales are reported in the company’s Data Center unit, which rose 115% year-over-year to $2.80 billion during Q2. AMD is now the world’s second largest vendor of data center graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train AI models, behind only Nvidia. Additionally, AMD reported that revenue for its core business, making processors for laptop computers and servers, rose 49% from a year earlier to $1.50 billion. AMD stock is up 27% in the last 12 months.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft’s just released Q2 financial results were actually very strong. The stock fell 2% immediately after the print because the company reported revenue for its cloud computing unit that missed Wall Street targets. However, a closer look at the numbers shows that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders, even when it comes to the cloud. The company reported an EPS of $2.95, which exceeded the analysts’ forecast of $2.93. Total revenue came in at $64.73 billion, which topped consensus expectations of $64.39 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales at Microsoft were up 15% from a year earlier. While cloud computing revenue of $28.52 billion did miss the $28.68 billion forecast on Wall Street, sales within the cloud segment were still up 19% from a year ago. Revenue from Azure cloud services grew 29% year-over-year. Elsewhere, Microsoft’s personal computing unit, which houses the Windows operating system, devices and search advertising, saw sales of $15.90 billion, up 14% from the same period of 2023.\n\nMicrosoft now has over 500 million monthly active users in gaming from consoles, personal computers and mobile devices following last year’s Activision Blizzard acquisition. The Q2 results confirm that Microsoft is a highly diversified technology giant that dominates nearly every market it competes in. Despite the dip in post-earnings, MSFT stock has been up 24% over the last 12 months.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial technology company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) came out of nowhere to deliver a great Q2 print. The results sent PYPL stock up more than 10% and suggested that a long-awaited turnaround at the company might finally be taking hold. PayPal announced EPS of $1.19, which beat Wall Street’s forecast of 99 cents. Revenue of $7.90 billion topped the $7.80 billion expected on the Street.\n\nPayPal also highlighted that its total payment volumes rose 11% to $416.80 billion during the quarter, while transaction dollars increased 8% to $3.60 billion. The strong financial results come as PayPal undertakes a turnaround strategy focused on payment innovations such as faster checkout times and AI-generated recommendations from merchants.\n\nWith nearly 400 million consumer accounts and 35 million merchant accounts, PayPal handles about 25% of the world’s e-commerce transactions yearly. In terms of guidance, PayPal said that, for the current third quarter, it expects mid-single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit earnings growth, both ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Thanks to its post-earnings bump, PayPal stock is now up 8% yearly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, GOOGL and MSFT.

        "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Was Pulling Back Today",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) roller-coaster week continued on Thursday with shares falling amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks. The plunge came in response to weak economic data this morning and the Federal Reserve's decision not to lower interest rates yesterday.\n\nAdditionally, close collaborator Arm Holdings fell sharply after reporting earnings last night.\n\nAs of 1:28 p.m. ET, Nvidia stock was down 7%, following a 13% surge on Wednesday and another 7% slide on Tuesday. At the same time, Arm stock was down 16.9%. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia gets tripped up again\n\nNvidia and its chip stock peers had tumbled over much of July in what seemed to be a rotation out of large-cap tech stocks that have surged this year and into underperforming small-caps.\n\nInvestors got a respite from that sell-off yesterday as Nvidia surged in response to strong results from AMD, but selling returned in force today.\n\nThere was no company-specific news out on Nvidia, but a disappointing manufacturing survey from the ISM showed the weakest reading since November and initial claims rose to a one-year high, a sign that the job market is continuing to slow.\n\nThose numbers, combined with the Fed's decision to maintain benchmark interest rates yesterday, have some fearing that the company could be weakening rapidly. A recession is still a risk and a downturn could be catastrophic for the chip sector, an already volatile industry, especially for high-flying players like Nvidia.\n\nAdditionally, Arm stock sold off despite the company beating estimates, which could be adding fuel to the argument that AI stocks are overvalued.\n\nWill Nvidia stock keep falling?\n\nNvidia stock did begin the day in positive territory so shifting investor sentiment due to weak data seems to be the main reason for today's decline.\n\nThe stock's volatility could continue tomorrow, when the July employment report comes out, and markets seem likely to swing one way or another depending on the numbers. Don't be surprised to see Nvidia shares move several percentage points again on Friday.\n\nThe AI chip leader will have a chance to redeem itself at the end of the month when it reports second-quarter earnings. The stock could continue to fall ahead of the report, but most of the recent slide seems related to concerns about valuation and a broader rotation into small-caps to prepare for a lower interest rate environment.\n\nBased on recent commentary from big tech companies and results from the likes of AMD and Arm, demand for AI hardware remains exceptionally strong. Nonetheless, investor sentiment and economic data are likely to determine Nvidia's price movements until its second-quarter results are in.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped as much as 7% on Thursday as chip stocks led a tech-fueled sell-off amid signs of a cooling economy.\n\nShares of the AI chip heavyweight declined along with the rest of the Tech sector (XLK) after weak economic data released during the session sent the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield lower and stocks fell.\n\nThe stock decline was a reversal from the prior session's monster 13% rally after peer AMD (AMD) posted better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance in a sign that investments in AI haven't slowed down.\n\n\"These hyperscalers ... their capital expenditures are high and potentially even rising into 2025. So this bodes incredibly well for Nvidia,” said Harvest Portfolio Management co-chief investment officer Paul Meeks on Thursday.\n\nNvidia doesn't reveal who its largest customers are, but according to Bloomberg data, Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) account for more than 40% of Nvidia's top line.\n\nMicrosoft makes up roughly 19% of the AI chipmaker's revenue, according to Bloomberg data. This week the tech giant revealed capital expenditures of almost $56 billion for the full year ending June 30.\n\nMicrosoft said it expects to increase its infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2025 more than it did in 2024.\n\n\"The fear of potentially some of this momentum not lasting, or maybe fear that the revenue trajectory wouldn't be there over the next 12 months or so — I think is starting to ease,\" CFRA senior equity analyst Angelo Zino told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.\n\nSocial media giant Meta, which accounts for roughly 10% of Nvidia's revenue, per Bloomberg data, said it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025 after posting strong results on Wednesday.\n\nChip peers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), ASML (ASML), and Super Micro (SMCI), also sank on Thursday in a reversal from the prior session. Semiconductor stocks fell on Thursday, erasing gains from the prior session.\n\nThe chip sector as a whole has benefited from the AI frenzy, but Nvidia is seen as the main beneficiary, up roughly 130% year to date. Rival AMD is down roughly 9% since the start of the year.\n\n\"Over time, the pie will get bigger. I still think that Nvidia will have most of the slices, and AMD ... they’ll be a good second supplier. But NVDIA will have a hold on this market for as far as the eye can see,\" said Meeks.\n\nOn Wednesday Morgan Stanley's analysts led by Joseph Moore placed Nvidia on their 'Top Pick' list after a recent pullback from record highs reached in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley cited five main drivers of the recent decline in Nvidia — spending plans, competition, export controls, supply chain fears, and valuation worries — but said, \"Through those concerns, the earnings environment is likely to remain strong, for Nvidia and for the whole AI complex.\"\n\nThe firm maintained its Overweight rating and $144 price target on the stock.\n\nThe company is set to issue its next quarterly report on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Is Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) The Best Stock to Invest In According to Ark Invest?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against Ark Invest's other stocks picks.\n\nIf there's one thing that can be said for sure, it's that Cathie Wood's investment approach is one of the most unique on Wall Street. In a finance industry dominated by long, short, value, and growth plays, Wood focuses primarily on high growth stocks which she and her firm believe hold the keys to the future. This has seen Ark Investment, whose latest SEC filings had a cumulative value of $14.4 billion, see some of its investments grow in triple digit percentages while others have floundered.\n\nIn fact, we analyzed the long term performance of Cathie Wood's top stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. This piece analyzed Wood and her firm's top 13F investments during Q4 2020 and checked their performance over the past three years. Out of these ten stocks, just one was in the green while nearly all others had lost most of their value or were down in red.\n\nDuring this time, some of Wood's predictions on the economy also stood at odds with the general consensus among Federal Reserve officials and other members of the finance industry. As a recap, the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in 2022 as part of its efforts to combat inflation. This caused a lot of pain for growth investors like Wood, as technology stocks started to fall. In June 2022, which saw the Fed announce a 75 basis point hike, which was the largest since 1994, Wood admitted that she was wrong about inflation. This acceptance came after her remarks in October 2021 on social media, in which she disputed Twitter (now X) founder Jack Dorsey's assessment that the US economy was headed for hyperinflation. While Dorsey's worries turned out to be a bit too extreme as well, Wood countered by stating:\n\n“In 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling.”\n\nShe added that three factors would force deflation. These were technologically \"enabled innovation\" driving down costs and making businesses postpone their spending, over leveraged firms selling subpar goods at below market prices, and businesses over ordering in response to the pandemic. These factors led her to conclude that \"once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies, prices should unwind.\"\n\nOf course, as it turned out, prices in America shot to record high levels in October 2022 and devastated technology stocks in their wake. One of the worst hit sectors was the semiconductor industry, and had it not been for the popularity of artificial intelligence, then these stocks would have spent 2023 recovering from their record lows in the prior year.\n\nShifting gears to analyze Wood's performance in 2024, her flagship fund is down 10.95% year to date. This stands in sharp comparison to the S&P benchmark's and the tech heavy NASDAQ's 15.20% year to date appreciation. In fact, the latter index is made of 100 of the most valuable technology stocks, so the fact that Wood's flagship fund is down means that her focus on the extreme end of the innovation spectrum is still proving to be a bit too risky for a market that has dealt with the brunt of multi decade high interest rates over the past couple of years.\n\nBut what about stocks? Cathie Wood invests in a variety of stocks, ranging from video communications to gene editing and artificial intelligence. So perhaps some of her top stock picks of 2024 have done better during Q1 and Q2 as the market starts to comfortably price expectations for an interest rate cut in September. Well, the top five Cathie Wood stocks that you'll find out about more as you read through this piece are mostly down. Their performance is -6.57%, 49%, -33.8%, -15.90%, and -5.63%, respectively, with the only stock in the green belonging to a financial trading platform provider that has benefited from the growing market adoption of Bitcoin. For some cryptocurrency stocks that are seeing love from analysts, you can check out 11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nWhile simply analyzing the year to date performance of her top five stocks is an easy way to form an opinion about Cathie Wood's latest investment strategy, we can also expand our focus to see which stocks she has positioned herself into as the Fed heads to an interest rate cuts. Insider Monkey's research shows that during Q2 2024, Cathie Wood bought eight new stocks. Additionally, she has also invested in an ETF linked to 7-10 year US Treasury bonds and two exchange traded funds (ETFs) linked to Ethereum. So, which stocks is Cathie Wood buying as the Fed nears an interest rate cut?\n\nWell, out of the eight new stocks that she bought in 2024's second quarter, two belonged to the 3D printing industry (one of these ranked 4th in our coverage of the top 3D printing stocks), another is a healthcare play that claims to have \"world's largest library of clinical & molecular data,\" followed by a cybersecurity stock, a digital promotions software provider, the 6thbest SaaS stock to buy according to hedge funds, the 6th stock on this list which is another AI and software play, and the 3rdbest undervalued stock to buy according to Reddit. Looking at their year to date performance, it is -33.42% and -77.7% for the 3D printing stocks, 8.99% for the healthcare play, and -6.49%, -35%, 2.47%, -7.49%, and -4.10%, respectively. As Wood would like to remind you, past performance is not an indicator of future returns, so whether she's positioning herself for a recovery in most of these stocks on the back of a lighter monetary and economic environment is up for you to decide.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of Ark Invest and Cathie Wood's latest stock picks, we picked out the ten most valuable positions from Ark Invest's Q2 2024 investment portfolio.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 15 Best Selling Car Brands in the World\n\n25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors  in Q1 2024: 74\n\nArk Investment Management’s Q2 2024 Stake: $1 billion\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most diversified car companies in the world. While its primary line of business is making and selling electric cars, it has also positioned itself well to benefit from any growth in renewable energy storage and artificial intelligence. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the earliest movers in the AI industry courtesy of its assisted driving software FSD's reliance on machine learning to help users with their driving needs. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s latest quarter saw it reap the benefits of this diversification, as while its automotive revenue dropped by 7% annually to sit at $21.2 billion, energy storage doubled and grew by 100% to sit at $1.5 billion. However, this still makes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an EV stock, and this brings with it the complexities of having to deal with the dependence on consumer purchasing power, the lithium supply chain, and tough competition in markets such as China.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Elon Musk made some telling comments during the Q2 2024 earnings call where he shared that he had no choice but to compete with NVIDIA due to the tight GPU supply chain:\n\n\"Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I’m incredibly impressed by NVIDIA’s execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it’s often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this, I guess I’m quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have — in order to ensure that we’ve got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo. And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the — it’s obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. So, I think we’ve really got to make Dojo work and we will.\"\n\nOverall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of Ark Invest's top 10 stock picks. You can visit Ark Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Selecting the Best AI Stock: TipRanks to the Rescue",
        "content": "The word AI (artificial intelligence) brings in visions of robots and complicated computer algorithms. Indeed, a lot goes on behind the scenes in making the robots and chatbots that become the face of AI technology and the company behind its development. Many companies are contributing to the AI revolution, including chip designers and manufacturers, coders, data analytics companies, and hardware and software makers. This makes it difficult for investors to choose the best AI stock.\n\nWell, we will try to simplify the process based purely on TipRanks tools. We leveraged TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool for Best Artificial Intelligence stocks to see how the leading AI companies perform on TipRanks Essentials’ parameters. We sorted these companies based on the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, giving us our top six companies.\n\nIncidentally, just yesterday, both Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD) painted a highly optimistic demand outlook for high-performance GPUs in their latest quarterly earnings call, leading to a rise in the stock prices of several chip stocks.\n\nAs an investor, the most important thing to watch is the share price growth potential. Consequently, our next logical step was to scan these six companies to see which one had the highest “Most Accurate Analyst” return as well as the “Most Profitable Analyst” return. Here’s what we found: chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has earned the highest returns on both counts. Let’s dive deeper into them.\n\nNvidia on a Tear, Up 136% YTD\n\nSemiconductor company Nvidia is on a tear this year, gaining more than 136% year-to-date. Chances are that the company is set for more upside potential, thanks to the burgeoning demand for its advanced chips and technology.\n\nLet us look at the two five-star analysts, who have sort of mastered the art of investing in NVDA stock. For Nvidia, the “Most Accurate Analyst” in the past one year has been J.P. Morgan’s Harlan Sur, boasting a 97% success rate and an average return of 104.17%. Interestingly, for Sur, the best stock rating to date is NVDA stock, when he generated a magnanimous 256.3% return between March 22, 2023 to March 22, 2024. On TipRanks, Sur ranks 39 out of 8,966 analysts.\n\nOn the other hand, the “Most Profitable Analyst” on NVDA stock is TD Cowen’s Matt Ramsay, who has a success rate of 90% and generated a massive average return of 120.46% in the past year.\n\nSimilar to Sur, Ramsay’s best rating to date has also been on Nvidia stock. Between October 10, 2022 and October 10, 2023, Ramsay generated a massive 292.60% return on his Buy call on NVDA stock. Interstingly, Ramsay fares better than Sur on TipRanks, as he ranks 13 out of the 8,966 analysts ranked on TipRanks.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Top 3 Tech Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "That tech stocks have been the driving force behind the two-year bull market is no surprise. It was the Magnificent Seven stocks that represented most of the S&P 500’s 24% gains last year. Most of those companies are repeating their performance in 2024, if not quite to the same degree.\n\nHowever, after hitting a new record high two weeks ago, the benchmark index started to peel back from those gains. Mostly, it was the result of investors selling off some of the top tech stocks and rotating into small-cap names.\n\nYet it remains that tech stocks are pushing stock earnings higher. According to FactSet (NYSE:FDS), of all 11 stock sectors, technology is reporting the highest earnings growth rates in the second quarter. And it is semiconductors with 25% growth and software at 12% that are responsible for the lion’s share of the gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf we drill down into individual stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is unsurprisingly the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. It is expected to report earnings of 64 cents per share, a 137% increase over the 27 cents per share it notched last year.\n\nExclude the AI chipmaker, though, and tech stocks are suddenly seeing much more mundane increases. Yet the three top tech stocks below represent excellent opportunities to buy right now.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just reported fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results. While it beat Wall Street estimates for revenue and earnings, certain segments came up a little short. Unfortunately, they are the most important to Microsoft’s future growth, and that has some investors worried. They shouldn’t be.\n\nThe software giant, which is now also a leading artificial intelligence stock, saw revenue of $64.7 billion, up 16% in currency adjusted dollars. Its Azure cloud services, which has quickly transformed into one of the biggest drivers of Microsoft’s business, was up 30% on an adjusted basis. The freak-out by the market is because last year segment sales grew 31%.\n\nSimilarly, its enterprise software operations were up 12% year-over-year versus a 13% increase last year. But the sky is not falling.\n\nAlthough Azure is second to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS cloud business, it has several key advantages. Because Microsoft offers hybrid cloud hosting, it allows clients to choose whether they want to keep data on-premises or in the cloud. It also lets them choose which data and how fast they migrate it to the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft stock is down 11% from its recent all-time high but investors should view that as a buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor stockAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also just reported earnings and apparently all a chipmaker needs these days is AI. Despite overall growth slowing and gaming revenue tumbling 59% from last year, AMD’s data center segment that houses the AI business witnessed 115% growth.\n\nYet this is what investors have been expecting and waiting for all along. The chipmaker was behind Nvidia in developing AI chips. It basically started from nothing a year ago but has been making up for lost time.\n\nIts AI accelerators outperform Nvidia’s standard data center chips, and though AMD’s rival is continually advancing the technology to improve speed and efficiency, AMD’s chips have the benefit of being cheaper.\n\nThat seems to be resonating with customers. Data center revenue climbed to $2.8 billion on the steep ramp in Instinct MI300 GPU shipments. Strong growth in fourth-generation EPYC CPUs also helped push sales up. CEO Lisa Su said, “The rapid advances in generative AI are driving demand for more compute in every market.”\n\nThis is not a one-off event. AMD hinted at it in the first quarter but the market sold off AMD stock. That didn’t happen this time as shares rose 4% but with a huge runway in front of it, this chipmaker is one to buy now.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmidst all the hoopla over AI, analog integrated circuits are often forgotten about. Yet they remain integral to the workings of virtually all computers and electronic devices. Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) remains one of the leading analog IC manufacturers. An inventory glut following the pandemic slowed business growth and caused sales to slow, but that is coming to an end.\n\nSecond-quarter sales fell 16% year-over-year but were up 4% sequentially. Texas Instruments told investors earlier this year business would improve going forward and it is beginning to play out. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry but over time revenue tends to grow. We are entering an upcycle now.\n\nBecause analog chips are used for uploading and downloading audio, video and image files, they are found in smartphones, digital camera, appliances and automobiles. Its their ubiquity, but under-the-radar nature, that makes them an attractive long-term investment.\n\nTXN stock has generated returns of more than 450% to investors over the past decade. Shares are up 20% year-to-date but there is plenty more long-term upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere, transforming industries left and right. Indeed, as AI advances into new realms and revolutionizes industries, it’s clear why placing bets on promising AI stocks could be a game-changer.\n\nMoreover, the potential for innovation and profitability seems virtually limitless. The global AI market is on an explosive trajectory. According to Fortune Business Insights, it’s expected to skyrocket from $621.19 billion in 2024 to a staggering $2.74 trillion by 2032. This represents a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.4% throughout the forecast period.\n\nThat said, wise investment decisions remain crucial. To fully benefit from this burgeoning industry, it is better to concentrate on three standout companies. These are not only trailblazers in their respective domains but also harness AI in remarkably impressive ways. Thus, now is the time to bet on these three AI stocks and build a successful portfolio for years to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a leading semiconductor company, uses AI to drive growth and innovation. It’s smartly boosting its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capabilities, which are critical for satisfying the complex requirements of AI applications.\n\nDespite a 15% drop in the stock price over the last month, Micron’s superb third-quarter can’t be ignored. The company topped expectations with a non-GAAP earnings-per-share (EPS) of 62 cents and achieved $6.81 billion in revenue, up 81.6% year-over-year (YOY) and 17% sequentially. Robust AI demand and strong execution fueled this revenue surge. The demand for HBM chips has been so strong that they are entirely sold out for both 2024 and 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Micron plans to expand AI-driven prospects with the upcoming HBM4 and HBM4E chips. Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron’s CEO, believes these advancements will position the business for significant revenue growth in the upcoming year.\n\nTherefore, Micron is primed to dominate the market, making it a stock worth considering now.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud computing platform that utilizes AI to streamline complex workflows with features like Now Assist. This enables it to transform its business efficiency. Currently, the stock is trading around its 52-week high and shows no signs of slowing down, thanks to multiple diverse catalysts.\n\nFirst is ServiceNow’s excellent Q2 earnings, which smashed expectations. Its non-GAAP EPS of $3.13 exceeded forecasts by 29 cents, and revenue rose to $2.63 billion, surpassing projections by a whopping $20 million. The company’s growth is also driven by high-value contracts, including 14 worth more than $5 million annually.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, ServiceNow thrives further in AI by partnering with industry stalwarts like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Such partnerships provide a goldmine of opportunities for the company by providing tools that accelerate productivity.\n\nLast but not least, a CEO survey highlighted that the CEOs are leveraging AI to supercharge growth. This makes ServiceNow a major beneficiary, with a tsunami of use cases that will bolster successful AI integrations.\n\nGitLab (GTLB) In this photo illustration the GitLab (GTLB) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGitLab (NASDAQ:GTLB) offers an all-in-one DevSecOps platform that improves enterprise software delivery efficiency. This integrated approach is especially critical as software becomes more complex and security concerns grow due to advancements in AI.\n\nIn Q1 2025, GitLab has shown impressive growth. Its revenue clocked in at $169.2 million, a 33% increase over the previous year. The company also reached a record $37 million free cash flow. Despite these strong results, the stock has yet to see a significant boost.\n\nThat said, GitLab is now perfectly positioned to benefit from the AI revolution. With the integration of AI in the development platform, GitLab improves every aspect of the development lifecycle and boosts productivity with fewer security issues. TipRanks analysts recognize this potential, assigning it a “strong buy” rating with a robust 28.83% upside.\n\nThus, this is the perfect time to hop in, as substantial returns are likely as the market starts to fully appreciate GitLab’s financials and innovations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Broadcom Stock Buy Alert: The Hidden AI Gem With Dividend Potential",
        "content": "Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a custom artificial intelligence chip designer, isn’t quite the market superstar that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is. However, Broadcom might actually catch up to Nvidia in certain respects. Investors may choose to own shares of Broadcom stock and Nvidia stock for more complete portfolio exposure to the AI-chip industry.\n\nBesides, Broadcom deserves credit for respecting its shareholders. The company shows its respect by delivering decent cash distributions each and every quarter. Therefore, growth and income investors should both take a closer look at Broadcom in 2024’s second half.\n\nBroadcom Stock and the Catch-Up Trade\n\nAs we’ll discuss in a moment, Broadcom beats Nvidia when it comes to quarterly dividend payments. However, here’s something you might not have expected. One analyst actually suggested that Broadcom could rival Nvidia as a financial-market darling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCitigroup analyst Christopher Danely declared that Broadcom stock is “catching up” to Nvidia stock as a semiconductor stock with the most positive investor sentiment.\n\nAccording to Barron’s, Danely “met last week with investors to discuss their favorite and least favorite chip stocks,” and determined that Broadcom is “right behind” Nvidia in terms of upbeat investor sentiment.\n\nRemember, this clearly isn’t a formal research study. Yet, Danely made some interesting points about Broadcom’s growth in the AI-chip industry. In particular, he observed that Broadcom “has more AI customers joining (Open AI and ByteDance) and accretion from VMware.”\n\nThat growth observation is a better reason to invest in Broadcom than just trying to play a “catch up to Nvidia” trade. In the end, there’s no need to pit Broadcom against Nvidia. They’re both good companies in a fast-growing AI-chip market.\n\nBroadcom’s Enticing Dividends\n\nCircling back to the idea that Broadcom respects its shareholders, we can confidently assert that the company pays an enticing dividend. Currently, Broadcom offers a forward annual dividend yield of 1.38%.\n\nThat might not sound like much, especially if you’re an income-focused investor. There are energy and real estate companies that pay higher dividends than Broadcom, no doubt.\n\nBut then, it’s not fair to compare Broadcom to energy and real estate companies. What’s more relevant is that Broadcom’s forward annual dividend yield is higher than the technology sector’s average yield of 1.025%.\n\nFor more tech-sector comparisons, note that Nvidia’s forward annual dividend yield is 0.04%. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) offers 0.43% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers 0.47%. So, Broadcom is generous on a relative basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom Stock: A Good AI-Chip Income Opportunity\n\nWill Broadcom “catch up” to Nvidia? Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nPer Barron’s, JPMorgan Chase analyst Harlan Sur envisions Broadcom as possibly generating “$150 billion in cumulative AI revenue over the next five years.” Thus, Broadcom is a fast-growing business in its own right, irrespective of Nvidia’s growth.\n\nAnd if you like to collect quarterly cash distributions, Broadcom is more generous than some other famous large-cap technology companies. With all of this in mind, Broadcom stock earns a “B” grade and can be combined with Nvidia stock for potentially powerful results.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Qualcomm Stock Warning: 3 Reasons QCOM Is NOT the Best Long-Term Pick",
        "content": "Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) made a relatively successful stock trade in 2024. Toward the middle of June, Qualcomm’s shares rose as much as 58.5% for the year. A sustained technology sector rally, as well as the inroads the semiconductor firm has made in artificial intelligence, were just a couple of the reasons QCOM has enjoyed a healthy price surge.\n\nUnfortunately, the AI-fueled rally may be heading toward an end. Last week, big tech stocks took a major hit, as investors grew increasingly fatigued over AI. In particular, the Nasdaq 100lost $1 trillion in market value, bringing down shares of major chipmakers companies. Those include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Qualcomm.\n\nLet’s explore three reasons Qualcomm probably will not make a great long-term investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore Trade Restrictions Could Be on The Way\n\nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since Donald Trump was in office. The Biden Administration has heightened the geopolitical rivalry even more. A couple of weeks ago, Bloomberg News reported the administration had warned its allies that it had been seeking to impose even harsher export controls that would allow the U.S. to impose restrictions upon “foreign-made products that use even the tiniest amount of American technology.”\n\nWhile this is set to really hamper the production of the Netherland’s ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Japan’s Tokyo Electron (OTCMKTS:TOELY), most chipmakers that have operations in China will see a negative impact.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 24th, revenue from companies with operations in China represented 62.5% of the semiconductor firm’s $35.8 billion top-line figure. If the geopolitical tensions between China and U.S. don’t simmer down, and it doesn’t look like they will soon, then no matter who wins in November, Qualcomm could end up getting the short end of the stick in the long run.\n\nAI PC Chips Still Have Much to Prove\n\nThere was a lot of talk about Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X Elite AI chips that would go into modern PCs. This system-on-a-chip (SoC) leverages what Qualcomm is calling the integrated Hexagon™ NPU. The AI chip allows users to train large language models on their laptops. A number of PC makers are looking to utilize Qualcomm’s latest SoC in their laptops. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of them. The software giant announced a Surface laptop and tablet that will employ the Snapdragon X Elite. Lenovo (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Acer, among several others, are also launching similar PCs.\n\nQualcomm is hoping an array of AI chips will spur demand for consumer electronics, but I believe that hope is misguided. Consumer demand is by no means picking up. Moreover, consumer confidence has been waning this year. AI features may not get consumers to rush to buy electronics when inflation is still high and budgets face constraints.\n\nQualcomm’s Valuation Is Not an Opportunity\n\nThe final point to make about Qualcomm regards the SoC maker’s trading valuation. QCOM trades at 17.1x forward earnings. This implies the chipmaker is trading at a significant discount to many of its peers. AI chipmaker Nvidia boasts a frothy valuation of 38x forward earnings, while competitor AMD doesn’t lag too far behind. Arm Holdings, which supplies the architecture upon which many Qualcomm CPUs are based, trades at an even higher 89.8x forward earnings.\n\nValue investors looking for undervalued stocks would be happy to find Qualcomm trading at such a discount. However, Qualcomm’s exposure to the smartphone market, which continues to be in a doldrum, not just due to waning consumer demand but also to a glut of smartphones in the market, does not bode well for Qualcomm’s long-term growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Top 3 Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: Summer 2024",
        "content": "After years of volatility, investors are embracing small-cap companies leading to a strong surge in Russell 2000 stocks in the last month.\n\nIt’s been a go big or go home mentality in the stock market this year with tech giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) driving much of the gains. However, there’s been a recent shift in gears as investors turn to small-cap companies for returns.\n\nThe Russell 2000 ETF which tracks the Russell 2000 Index (an index for small-cap stocks) surged 12% in the last month. According to experts, the gains were driven by expectations of interest rate cuts, an improving inflationary environment, and the valuations of large-cap stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut how high can the Russell 2000 go? Well while the index is still down 8% from its 2021 highs, many believe the rally will be sustained. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes the index could go as high as 40% by the end of the summer. DataTrek says investor sentiment gives the index more room to run.\n\nGiven the glowing optimism, Russell 2000 stocks stand out as top buys in the market right now. Here’s a look at three companies to add to your portfolio.\n\nAbercrombie and Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nEveryone likes a good comeback story and that’s exactly what Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF) stock offers. The 90s fashion brand has seen a reversal in fortunes fueled by a strategic rebranding to make the brand more inclusive.\n\nA&F shed its preppy image to opt for a quality-focus label that caters to a wider range of preferences and body types. This was accompanied by a rise in efficiency that helped the company reclaim its position in the fashion industry.\n\nThe success of its efforts was evident in its last earnings report. The company reported net income of $113.9 million for the period, nearly seven times higher than a year ago. Revenue came in at $1.02 billion over the estimated $963 million while sales grew 22% YoY. A&F attributes this growth to better inventory control, marketing efforts, and agile chase capabilities. For the full year, it expects sales to rise by 10%.\n\nANF stock is up 66% this year and the company shows no signs of slowing down. Its rosy outlook and successful rebranding efforts make this stock a worthy investment. A&F is also a part of the Russell 2000 stocks and could see a boost from a decline in interest rates.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The Duolingo (DUOL) logo on a smartphone screen with a map in the background.\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-learning has always remained a high-growth industry and Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) dominates the market for learning languages online. The company’s freemium platform has amassed a loyal following of  97 million monthly active users. This includes 7.4 million paying subscribers. This resulted in impressive gains for the company in the last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income for the period grew to $27 million, a significant incline from the $2.6 million loss a year ago. Revenue and bookings grew 45% and 41% respectively. For the upcoming quarter, Duolingo provided optimistic guidance and anticipates a 39% growth in revenue YoY in the $175 million to $177.5 million range\n\nThe growth will be fueled by several key factors. This includes an expansion into new verticals such as physics and math to widen its competitive moat. Along with a deeper monetization of its free users through in-app purchases. Duolingo’s total user base represents just a fraction of its target market, giving the e-learning platform plenty of room to grow in the long haul.\n\nDUOL 20% this year presents a great buying opportunity ahead of the anticipated rally in Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nSprouts Farmers Market (SFM) An exterior sign on a Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) store in Granada Hills, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe rise in demand for healthy food served as a boon for Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM). The health-focused grocery chain experienced strong growth in rising demand for its highly differentiated products. It hits the sweet spot for healthy groceries with its high-quality products at competitive prices. This translated to exceptional earnings in its second quarter as it breezed past analyst expectations.\n\nThe company saw a 6.7% uptick in comparable sales growth and earnings of 91 cents per share over the estimated 78 cents. Quarterly sales also grew to $1.89 billion surpassing an estimate of $1.83 billion. An additional five locations were opened during the period bringing the total store count to 419. Looking to Q3, Sprouts anticipates earnings between $0.71 and $0.75 per share. Full-year net sales are expected to grow by 9% to 10%.\n\nAccording to its CEO, the growth was the result of its assortment of health products and unique in-store experience. Grocery chains remain one of the least penetrated categories in e-commerce so a great in-store experience is key to driving gains. This is something Sprouts has mastered.\n\nLooking at the big picture, Sprouts’ strong financials and growth prospects signal plenty of upside in the long haul. This is one of the top Russell 2000 stocks to get behind this summer for lucrative returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "4 Top Tech Stocks to Buy on Soaring Hopes of September Rate Cut",
        "content": "Wall Street rebounded on Jul 31, led by a tech rally, as investors now strongly believe that the Federal Reserve will implement its first interest rate cut in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 1.6% to end at 5,522.30, while the Nasdaq rose 2.6% to close at 17,599.40. Both the indexes recorded their best session since February. The Dow also rose 0.2% to finish at 40,842.79 points.\n\nThe rebound came as the Federal Reserve, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, kept interest rates unchanged in the current range of 5.25-5.5%. A small section of market participants was hopeful that the Fed could start its interest rate cuts in July but that didn’t happen.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve Chairman, in his first press conference after the end of the July FOMC meeting, said that if data gives central bank officials the confidence that inflation is easing steadily, it could start its easing cycle.\n\n“If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell said.\n\nInflation has declined substantially over the past couple of months after rising in the first quarter. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s key inflation gauge, rose 0.1% sequentially in June, which was in line with economists’ expectations.\n\nYear over year, PCE rose 2.5% in June after increasing 2.6% in May. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2% month over month in June and 2.6% year over year.\n\nAlso, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter, double the pace from the first quarter and sharply higher than economists’ expectations of a rise of 2%.\n\nMarket participants are now confident that the Federal Reserve will start its easing cycle with a 25-basis point rate cut in September followed by two more by the end of this year. Lower borrowing rates typically help growth-oriented assets like technology stocks. Moreover, tech stocks have been driving the market rally since 2023.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN,Apple, Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Netflix, Inc. NFLX that have strong potential for 2024.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 58.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 60 days. APPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on the Possibility of NVIDIA’s (NVDA) China Chip: ‘You Kidding Me’?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell.Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program talked about how the China factor is affecting US stocks. He said that companies that have exposure to China are getting hammered and he does not see that changing “anytime soon.”\n\nCramer said that currently there are many “pernicious forces working against the bulls.” The CNBC host said many growth stocks are declining right when interest rates are around the corner. He said that companies that don’t benefit from rate cuts are going down. Cramer also mentioned weak earnings reports which show companies having challenged client bases. Cramer mentioned a consumer products company that was recently hammered because of weakness in China.\n\nCramer thinks the problem in China is twofold: there’s a government that does not like America or American businesses while the population is “cash-strapped” even if they “like our country.”\n\nCramer said “China is so darn complicated.” He said at one point the Chinese government was “so business friendly” that Western companies thought it’s “insane” not to go there. But since the Trump administration, the country has been engaged in trade wars with the US.\n\nCramer said the Chinese government “took advantage of us on trade.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) One of the Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nCramer in a latest program talked about several positive developments for Nvidia stock. A Wall Street analyst has said the stock will go to $175, while media reports suggest the company is making a chip for China that won’t be “prosecuted” or “pulled off” by “this administration” according to Cramer. But Cramer questioned the possibility of a China chip from Nvidia getting approval if Trump comes to power.\n\n“A Harris presidency is much more benign for Silicon Valley than a Trump presidency. Do you think they’ll be able to come up with a Chinese chip that Trump would approve of? You kidding me?”\n\nStory continues\n\nRaymond James analyst Javed Mirza recently said in a report that NVDA has “triggered a mechanical sell signal” based on a moving average convergence/divergence indicator. In a technical analysis report, he stated that the stock is trading below its 50-day moving average and exhibiting early signs of selling pressure. This, according to Mirza, shows there is a looming corrective phase lasting 1-3 months. He added that a sustained break below the 50-day moving average could lead to a decline towards 94.94, representing a further 16.9% drop from current levels.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock’s price target at $135.\n\n“We downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.” New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\n\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has “no idea what I’m talking about” or it’s the market that just does not understand.\n\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the “driving seat” of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won’t be as easy as the market assumes.\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to lead both the market and the portfolio, remaining a top performer in the period gaining 36.7%. Nvidia is the market leader in designing and selling Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which has recently benefited from the insatiable demand of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The company currently captures 92% market share of data center GPUs and grew revenue, earnings and free cash flow (“FCF”) an astounding 126%, 392%, and 610%, respectively, over the last year. While we expect competition to increase, we think NVDA can continue to maintain top market share. While many are concerned with backlog times shortening, we think the rollout of the B100, which promises 2.5x better performance for only 25% more cost, later this year will create more shortages. With leading edge technology, an increasing innovation cycle and strong cash generation, the company is well positioned for the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).”\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer Latest Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Buy and Sell. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "US progressives push for Nvidia antitrust investigation",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. progressive groups and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed the Department of Justice to investigate Nvidia over competition concerns, citing the company's dominance of the market for the chips driving the artificial-intelligence boom.\n\nDemand Progress and nine other groups wrote a letter this week urging Department of Justice antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter to probe business practices at Nvidia, whose market value hit $3 trillion this summer on demand for chips able to run the complex models behind generative AI.\n\nThe groups, which oppose monopolies and promote government oversight of tech companies, among other issues, took aim at Nvidia's bundling of software and hardware, a practice that French antitrust enforcers have flagged as they prepare to bring charges.\n\n\"This aggressively proprietary approach, which is strongly contrary to industry norms about collaboration and interoperability, acts to lock in customers and stifles innovation,\" the groups wrote.\n\nIn June, Reuters reported a deal was reached among U.S. regulators that directs the Justice Department to oversee potential antitrust probes into Nvidia, while the Federal Trade Commission is looking at Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said the company spent billions of dollars developing AI-capable computing technology before demand existed, and is \"committed to opening new markets and growth opportunities for our partner ecosystem.\"\n\n\"Regulators need not be concerned, as we scrupulously adhere to all laws and ensure that NVIDIA is openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise,\" the spokesperson said. \"We'll continue to support aspiring innovators in every industry and market and are happy to provide any information regulators need.\"\n\nNvidia has roughly 80% of the AI chip market, including the custom AI processors made by cloud computing companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com. The chips made by the cloud giants are not available for sale themselves but typically rented through each platform.\n\nExcluding the cloud providers' chips, Nvidia achieved nearly 100% market share. That domination helps the company report gross margins between 70% and 80%.\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, expressed concerns about Nvidia's control of the market in a statement to Reuters.\n\n\"Allowing a single company to effectively be the gatekeeper for the world's AI future is dangerous and poses dire economic risks. The DOJ is right to investigate Nvidia's anticompetitive practices,\" she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment.\n\nKanter said in an interview on CNBC on Friday, without discussing Nvidia specifically, that antitrust enforcers are concerned about areas where there are bottlenecks that companies could take advantage of to exclude rivals.\n\n\"We want a world where, one, there is room for investment and development and growth into new rivals and technologies,\" he said.\n\nLast year, Reuters reported that investments in the semiconductor industry were down considerably in the face of Nvidia's overwhelming market share.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York and Max Cherney in San Franciso; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Before Aug. 28?",
        "content": "Shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have more than doubled since the beginning of the year. Accelerating demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) used for artificial intelligence (AI) training has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nHowever, growth stocks can be volatile during earnings season, and Nvidia is one hot tech stock that has a history of wild swings. In fact, the shares have fallen more than 50% from their previous high twice in the last six years. Both sell-offs came amid slowing growth for the company's data center GPUs, highlighting the cyclical nature of the chip industry.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to announce fiscal second-quarter financial results on Aug. 28. The numbers are expected to be solid based on management's guidance. Let's review the key growth drivers, near-term catalysts, and risks to consider before deciding to buy the stock ahead of the company's next update.\n\nNvidia's data center business looks solid\n\nLarge data centers are in the process of upgrading hardware and other systems for training large language models and generative AI applications like ChatGPT. This drove an incredible 427% year-over-year increase in Nvidia's data center revenue last quarter, and management expects another strong quarter. Guidance calls for Nvidia's total revenue to be approximately $28 billion, representing growth of 107% year over year.\n\nInvestors will be looking for another blowout quarter to justify the growth expectations implied by the high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The consensus analyst estimate calls for the company's revenue to come in slightly higher than management's guidance, or $28.49 billion, with earnings per share landing at $0.64. Nvidia's revenue has come in above the consensus estimates over the last year, and investors will be looking for a repeat if the stock is going to move higher in the near term. NVDA Quarterly Actual Revenue Chart\n\nOf course, Wall Street will be just as interested in management's comments about future demand trends, and on that score, Nvidia has a lot in the pipeline.\n\nLast quarter, it started shipping its new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution that is optimized for AI. Nvidia is going up against established companies in the networking market like Broadcom, but management believes this new market will translate to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.\n\nNvidia also announced a software offering for its AI Enterprise platform called Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIM), which is designed to help AI developers build and launch new applications much faster.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost importantly, investors will focus on Nvidia's comments about demand trends for the new Blackwell GPU platform. It takes processing power to a whole new level for AI workloads and is expected to drive strong revenue growth. Early demand for Blackwell is running ahead of supply, which is a great sign for Nvidia's growth prospects looking ahead to next year.\n\nBuy now, or wait?\n\nThere have been concerns about rising competition from Broadcom and Nvidia's own customers (cloud services providers) making custom AI chips. But this hasn't hurt Nvidia's revenue so far, and the company's rapid pace of innovation in bringing new products to market should keep it in the driver's seat of the AI chip market.\n\nThat said, industry conditions can change quickly. In November 2021, right before the stock's big haircut, management was talking about strong demand it was seeing in AI for working with large language models and recommender systems. But that didn't prevent the data center market from slowing and pressuring Nvidia's revenue growth in 2022.\n\nThe best time to buy the stock historically is when the company is experiencing sluggish demand, because that usually coincides with a cheaper stock price before an industry recovery. The long-term outlook for Nvidia's data center business is solid, considering the $1 trillion of infrastructure that is shifting to more advanced computing hardware for AI workloads. But in the near term, Nvidia shares are already trading at a premium valuation that factors in this growth opportunity.\n\nFor this reason, it might be a good idea to wait until after Nvidia reports earnings on Aug. 28. There's always a chance the stock might dip, especially if management doesn't offer forward revenue guidance that is quite as high as analysts are expecting. This would provide investors a better value point to start a position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech Market Sell-Off: 2 Stocks to Buy in 2024 Before It's Too late",
        "content": "A sell-off has taken hold of the stock market in July, mainly aimed at the tech industry. The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is down by 9% since July 10, when the bulk of the declines began.\n\nThe downturn started amid increasing tensions between the U.S. and China. Earlier this month, a Bloomberg article revealed that the U.S. was considering further tightening restrictions on China's access to advanced technology. Implementing the proposed measure, the Foreign Direct Product Rule, would allow the U.S. to restrict foreign companies from exporting products to China that use even small amounts of American technology. Such a policy could negatively affect the sales of large numbers of tech companies.\n\nThe earnings season that kicked off in late July only exacerbated matters as Wall Street was unimpressed by some of the first reports. However, tech remains an excellent place to find reliable long-term investments. Budding technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing have plenty of growth ahead.\n\nSo, run, don't walk to take advantage after tech market sell-offs. Here are two stocks to buy before it's too late.\n\n1. Nvidia is at its lowest valuation in months\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has fallen by 17% since early July. While that hasn't felt great for established shareholders, it has made the stock a bit more attractive for those considering opening new positions. Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is now well below its three-year average and significantly lower than it was a year ago. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe stock has risen by 478% in the last three years while maintaining an average P/E of about 87. So while a P/E of 66 would generally be viewed as high rather than a bargain, Nvidia's significant growth potential and its dominant position in a key tech arena make that a compelling level at which to invest.\n\nNvidia has delivered massive revenue and earnings growth in recent years by cornering the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs) -- chips capable of handling the heavy workloads involved in training AI models. As many of its rivals scrambled to launch new chips that could take advantage of rising demand, Nvidia was perfectly positioned to supply developers and cloud infrastructure providers worldwide, achieving an estimated 85% market share in the AI chip industry.\n\nRivals like AMD and Intel have released competing products. However, Nvidia has retained its majority share thanks in part to its Compute Unified Device Architecture, the software platform that accompanies its GPUs. Large numbers of developers have acclimated to this platform, making them less likely to switch to a competing product that would come with a learning curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is staying ahead of the competition with regular updates to its chip lineup. The company introduced its Blackwell GPU architecture earlier this year, and its Rubin architecture is due out in 2025.\n\nNvidia is crushing it in AI, and also holds solid positions in gaming, consumer products, self-driving technology, and more. After its recent sell-off, the company's stock is just too good to pass up.\n\n2. Alphabet's booming cloud business is key\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have declined by 13% since July 10. Beyond the headwind of a sectorwide downturn, that pull-back was driven by its earnings release on July 23 and a new announcement from OpenAI just two days later.\n\nOn July 25, OpenAI unveiled SearchGPT, a prototype search engine that will eventually be integrated into the ChatGPT chatbot. That tool could cut into Google's market share in search. However, Google controls more than 90% of the search engine market, and has dominated it for at least the last decade. With market dominance and vast financial resources, it won't be easy to dethrone Google.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet's second-quarter results last week beat estimates on multiple fronts. Revenue jumped by 14% year over year, exceeding the consensus estimate by $450 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share came in at $1.89 when analysts had expected $1.85. Yet Alphabet's stock slid, which market watchers attributed to the slower-than-expected growth of YouTube ad sales, which increased by 13%.\n\nHowever, there was plenty to be bullish about in the Q2 report. Operating income soared by 26%, powered by significant growth in its AI-focused Google Cloud segment. Google Cloud revenue increased by 29%, with operating income nearly tripling to top $1 billion for the first time.\n\nAlphabet's bread-and-butter business has long been ad sales. However, recent trends suggest cloud computing is likely its future. The company has ramped up its AI expansion, making Google Cloud its fastest-growing business.\n\nTrading at an attractive price-to-earnings ratio of 24, Alphabet is a no-brainer tech stock to buy in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investors love to see key company insiders buying stock. It indicates they have confidence in the company's future. On the other hand, when insiders sell it can cause concerns that maybe they know something that outsiders don't.\n\nThat leads me to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The GPU maker's CEO, Jensen Huang, sold $296 million of Nvidia stock in July. Should investors be worried?\n\nSelling like it's going out of style\n\nHuang didn't trim his stake in Nvidia once or twice in July. He sold Nvidia shares 20 times during the month. There were only two trading days when he didn't sell any shares.\n\nAs you can guess from the total amount sold, we're not talking about small-dollar transactions here. Huang's sales of Nvidia stock made him between $13.6 million and $16.1 million per trade.\n\nDate Shares Sold Proceeds July 1, 2024 120,000 $14.7 million July 2, 2024 120,000 $14.7 million July 3, 2024 120,000 $14.9 million July 5, 2024 120,000 $15.3 million July 8, 2024 120,000 $15.4 million July 9, 2024 120,000 $15.7 million July 10, 2024 120,000 $16.1 million July 11, 2024 120,000 $15.7 million July 12, 2024 120,000 $15.6 million July 15, 2024 120,000 $15.5 million July 16, 2024 120,000 $15.2 million July 17, 2024 120,000 $14.3 million July 18, 2024 120,000 $14.4 million July 19, 2024 120,000 $14.3 million July 22, 2024 120,000 $14.7 million July 23, 2024 120,000 $14.8 million July 24, 2024 120,000 $14.1 million July 25, 2024 120,000 $13.6 million July 26, 2024 120,000 $13.6 million July 29, 2024 120,000 $13.6 million\n\nData sources: SEC filings.\n\nNvidia's CEO sold the same number of shares each time. Earlier in the month, his proceeds were higher because the stock was rising. Later in July, his proceeds fell as Nvidia's share price tanked.\n\nHuang-ing investors out to dry?\n\nIs Huang bailing on Nvidia while he's promoting the chipmaker's prospects to outside investors? Not really.\n\nThe CEO's sales were all related to restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). These are stock grants tied to Huang's compensation. RSUs are commitments by an employer to grant shares to an employee at a specified future date provided certain conditions are met. PSUs are shares awarded to an employee based on company performance.\n\nHuang regularly sells RSUs and PSUs. Other Nvidia executives and board members do too. However, these sales shouldn't be interpreted as reflecting a lack of confidence in the company.\n\nWhile $297 million is a lot of money, it's small compared to Huang's overall stake in Nvidia. As of March 25, 2024, he owned nearly 93.5 million shares with a current value of roughly $9.7 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNo need to worry\n\nThe bottom line is that there is no need to worry at all about insider selling by Nvidia's leaders. But should investors worry about Nvidia's recent sharp pullback? I don't think so.\n\nNothing about Nvidia's business or prospects has changed over the last few weeks. I suspect the company will announce another round of impressive revenue and earnings growth in its next quarterly update on Aug. 28.\n\nNvidia's story could get even better with the upcoming launch of its Blackwell GPU platform. Huang has said Blackwell \"will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" He'll probably be proven right at least on the first part of that statement.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Phenomenal Stock-Split Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in August, and 2 to Absolutely Avoid",
        "content": "Although anything having to do with artificial intelligence (AI) has been garnering Wall Street's attention for more than a year, a strong case can be made that the trend investors can't get enough of right now is companies enacting stock splits.\n\nA stock split is a mechanism that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits won't change a company's market cap or in any way impact its operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits come in two forms, one of which has a considerably better track record of making long-term investors richer. Reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price, usually with the purpose of ensuring it remains listed on a major stock exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, forward-stock splits reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors who might not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker. Since forward splits are executed in a position of strength, often by companies that are out-innovating their peers, they're what investors tend to gravitate toward.\n\nSince 2024 began, one dozen exceptional businesses have announced and/or completed stock-splits (asterisk denotes a completed split):\n\nWalmart(NYSE: WMT): 3-for-1* Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 10-for-1* Amphenol(NYSE: APH): 2-for-1* Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG): 50-for-1* Mitsui(OTC: MITSY)(OTC: MITSF): 2-for-1* Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM): 2-for-1* Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO): 10-for-1* MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR): 10-for-1 Cintas(NASDAQ: CTAS): 4-for-1 Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI): 1-for-10 Lam Research(NASDAQ: LRCX): 10-for-1 Sony Group(NYSE: SONY): 5-for-1\n\nAmong these time-tested businesses is one phenomenal stock-split stock that's begging to be bought in August, as well as two ultra-popular stock-split stocks that can be avoided like the plague.\n\nStock-split stock No. 1 to absolutely avoid in August: Nvidia\n\nWorking backwards, the first stock-split stock that can be easily avoided in August (and likely beyond) is AI colossus Nvidia. Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 split was completed following the close of trading on June 7.\n\nThis is unlikely to be a popular opinion considering how dominant Nvidia's hardware has become in AI-accelerated data centers. Semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights pegged Nvidia's share of graphics processing units (GPUs) shipped for data centers in 2023 at a whopping 98%! With continued innovation -- e.g., the rollout of the Blackwell platform later this year and the expected debut of the Rubin GPU architecture in 2026 -- Nvidia's GPUs shouldn't have a problem maintaining their compute advantage.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut as I've recently argued, compute advantage isn't everything when it comes to AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nBeginning this year, Nvidia is contending with competition for valuable \"real estate\" in high-compute data centers. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out and/or increasing production of their respective AI-GPUs in the second-half of 2024.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia's four largest customers by net sales (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are developing AI chips for their respective data centers. This signals a clear desire by these leading customers to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware moving forward. Even with compute advantages, the available \"real estate\" for Nvidia's chips in data centers is set to diminish.\n\nHistory isn't Nvidia's friend, either. Including the advent of the internet roughly 30 years ago, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation, technology, or trend for three decades that avoided an early stage bubble-bursting event. In simpler terms, investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and utility of new technologies. With most businesses lacking a rock-solid plan for their AI investments, it's looking as if artificial intelligence is the next in a long line of next-big-thing bubbles.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's trailing-12-month price-to-sales ratio is more or less on par with where market leaders Cisco Systems and Amazon peaked prior to the dot-com bubble collapsing. History may not repeat to a \"t,\" but it does have a tendency to rhyme on Wall Street. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock-split stock No. 2 that's worth avoiding in August: MicroStrategy\n\nA second stock-split stock that's rife with red flags and should be absolutely avoided by investors in August (and well beyond) is AI-driven enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy's 10-for-1 forward split will take effect after the close of trading on August 7.\n\nAlthough it's, technically, a software company, MicroStrategy's claim to fame is that it's the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world's leading cryptocurrency by market value. As of June 20, MicroStrategy held 226,331 Bitcoins, which is more than 1% of the 21 million tokens that'll ever be mined.\n\nWhile it's generally easier to buy shares of MicroStrategy through your broker than it is to purchase Bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange, there are a number of drawbacks to this strategy.\n\nThe single biggest problem with betting on upside in MicroStrategy stock is that investors are grossly overvaluing its Bitcoin assets. At the time of this writing, a single Bitcoin costs $67,888, which values MicroStrategy's Bitcoin portfolio at nearly $15.4 billion. However, MicroStrategy's market cap is a lofty $31 billion, which suggests that investors are valuing its Bitcoin assets between $29 billion and $30 billion. Why would you pay $130,000 per Bitcoin token when you can buy it on an exchange for less than $68,000?\n\nAnother problem for MicroStrategy is that it's been financing its Bitcoin purchases with convertible-debt offerings. Bitcoin is known for its steep bear markets, which feature losses of greater than 80%. If the world's largest cryptocurrency goes into hibernation, once again, there's no guarantee MicroStrategy will be able to cover its debt obligations.\n\nI'll also add that Bitcoin's first-mover advantages aren't what they once were. Other blockchain projects offer faster payments at a considerably lower cost. It's effectively a first-generation network that's been outdone by multiple third-generation projects.\n\nTo round things out, MicroStrategy's enterprise analytics software segment has seen sales decline by 14% over the last decade.\n\nThe phenomenal stock-split stock to buy hand over fist in August: Sirius XM Holdings\n\nOn the other side of the coin is the cheapest stock-split stock of the dozen that's begging to be bought in August. I'm talking about the only high-profile company set to conduct a reverse-stock split in September (1-for-10) -- satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings.\n\nLike every publicly traded company, Sirius XM is working its way through various challenges. The biggest concern at the moment is an expected weakening of auto sales in the second half of this year. Sirius XM counts on promotional users (via new vehicle purchases) becoming self-pay subscribers. If the U.S. economy weakens or consumers show reduced interest in new vehicles, Sirius XM can expect self-pay subscribers to slow or decline.\n\nOn the bright side, Sirius XM has history in its corner. Although economic downturns are normal and unavoidable, they're most-importantly short-lived. Only three of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II reached the 12-month mark. Long-winded expansions tend to favor the entertainment industry, including radio operators.\n\nBut what makes Sirius XM such an intriguing investment is its differences from traditional radio companies. Whereas terrestrial and online radio operators generate almost all of their revenue from advertising, Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its first-quarter sales from ads (via Pandora). Rather, it generated close to 78% of its revenue from subscriptions.\n\nWhen economic downturns do arise, or the winds of change begin to blow, it's not uncommon for businesses to reduce their ad spending. But it's far less common for subscribers to cancel their service with Sirius XM. In other words, Sirius XM's operating cash flow will fluctuate far less than its peers during periods of economic turbulence.\n\nTo add to this point, it's the only licensed satellite-radio operator. Being a legal monopoly affords Sirius XM strong pricing power, which it can use to stay ahead of the inflationary curve.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Sirius XM's historically cheap valuation. Even with the stock market at one of its priciest valuations spanning 153 years, shares of Sirius XM can be scooped up for less than 12 times forward-year earnings. The cherry on the sundae is that you'll also generate a 2.9% annual yield for your patience.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Arm Holdings on Wednesday delivered softer-than-expected guidance that overshadowed better-than-expected quarterly results, sending its shares tumbling over 11% in the premarket trade.\n\nThe chip designer's guided fiscal Q2 adjusted earnings between $0.23 and $0.27 a share, missing analyst estimates of $0.28. Revenue was forecasted in a range of $780M to $830M, or $805M at the midpoint, also falling shy of Wall Street estimates of $812.8M.\n\nThe company reported fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings of $0.40 a share on revenue of $939 million, beating estimates of $0.35 and $906.5M respectively.\n\nThe better-than-expected results were driven by a 39% surge in revenue in Q2 from a year earlier, underpinned by \"record license revenue and strong growth in royalty revenue,\" the company said.\n\n\"The proliferation of AI everywhere is driving more companies to make broad and long-term commitments to use Arm’s power-efficient technology in their future products,\" the company said in its quarterly earnings statement released Wednesday.\n\nFull-year guidance for adjusted EPS of $1.45 and $1.65 on revenue of $3.80B to $4.1B was unchanged. That compared with analyst estimates for adjusted EPS of $1.57 on revenue of $3.99B.\n\n\"While we still see the future of Arm as one we’d like to be a part of, we acknowledge the questions that might be raised after this print,\" Guggenheim analysts said in a post-earnings note.\n\n\"Nevertheless, we expect Armv9 to continue to drive outsized growth to be aided by CSS next year, and while we believe there are few clear beneficiaries to the AI story beyond Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), we believe that Arm shares that spotlight,\" they added, maintaining a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nSeparately, despite a mixed report, Mizuho analysts highlighted strong AI handset adoption from ARM's print, which they believe is \"key to driving handset refresh and ARM outlook.\"\n\n\"ARM was off in after-hours as company as maintained guide for a premium valuation stock given high Networking/IoT inventory, but key we believe is handset AI and Custom Si ramps ahead,\" they noted.\n\nYasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nArm Holdings softer guidance overshadows better-than-expected Q1 results\n\nEarnings call: ADP reports strong Q4 and optimistic FY2025 outlook\n\nEarnings call: Stepan Company sees growth and resilience in Q2 2024\n\nView comments",

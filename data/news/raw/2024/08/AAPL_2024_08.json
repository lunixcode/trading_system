        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Goldman Sachs’ Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\n\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\n\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\n\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\n\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\n\nStory continues\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\n\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\n\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities’ PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\n\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\n\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\n\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 184\n\nGS' Number Of Funds: 43\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest and most valuable consumer technology company in the world. Roughly 52% of its nine month revenue ending June, or $155 billion out of $296 billion came from the sales of its iPhone smartphone lineup. This means that the phone is key to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis and is baked into the share price. This is based on investor belief that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s design strengths and robust ecosystem allow the firm to rely on its user base of roughly 1.5 billion users as of 2023 regularly upgrading its smartphones. This ensures that the iPhone continues to bring in billions of dollars in revenue annually. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) benefits from its world class design and engineering facilities which have also allowed it to reduce dependence on third party suppliers for key components such as smartphones and notebook processors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $61.5 billion in cash and equivalents also means that it can splurge on developing new products to maintain its competitive edge.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"Recent Activity This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shis, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on- device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\n\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\n\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Ahead of the launch event of the new iPhone, reports indicate that the company has placed orders for the assembly of around 90 million units of the new phone, ten million more than last year. The increase in orders might stem from the expected growth in sales for these phones that will be shipped with Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple has been aggressively marketing over the past few months. Experts, like Dan Loeb of Third Point, believe the new AI features will lead to stronger up cycles for new launches. Apple Intelligence features are not compatible with older phones and might compel customers to faster upgrades.\n\nWall Street analysts have also weighed in on these developments regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). For example, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring has an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $273. In a recent investor note, the analyst highlighted that Apple Intelligence remained the key to unlocking pent up iPhone demand and accelerating the replacement cycle. The analyst expects the launch event to heavily feature AI integration on the new iPhone 16.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Incredible FAANG Stocks You'll Want to Consider Adding to Your Portfolio in September",
        "content": "It's been a while since the so-called FAANG stocks were all must-have names. Other companies like Nvidia and Microsoft have since stolen their thunder. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) helped this happen, of course.\n\nWith the AI euphoria finally starting to fade, though -- and with the economy easing its way back to normal -- investors should soon start seeing how all the things that made FAANG stocks so great then still apply now. That's why you may want to step into some of them sooner or later, particularly given that a few of these stocks are trading at a discount right now.\n\nHere's a closer look at three FAANG stocks that are best bets for September.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been very un-Amazon-like since early July. Share prices are currently down more than 10% from that month's record high and are still sinking, headed into what's historically a tough month for the stock market.\n\nAt least some of the weakness stems from the company's second-quarter revenue miss. Although sales of $148 billion were up 10% year over year, analysts were calling for a top line of $148.7 billion. Investors flinched, and understandably so.\n\nYou might want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, though.\n\nThe fact is, Amazon is still a growth steamroller no other e-commerce player wants to compete with. It controls around 40% of the United States' online shopping market (according to data from eMarketer), trouncing next-nearest Walmart's reach. And, being a name that's nearly synonymous with the e-commerce industry, it's arguably better positioned than any rival to capture more than its share of the industry's continued growth. It's doing pretty well outside of the U.S. as well; last quarter's international e-commerce revenue was up nearly 7%.\n\nPerhaps Amazon's most underestimated growth engine, however, is its cloud computing arm. Amazon Web Services sales improved by nearly 19% year over year during the three-month stretch ending in June, leading to a 74% increase in its cloud business's operating income. Both numbers extend well-established trends that should carry on into the distant future, too. Market research outfit Mordor Intelligence believes the global cloud computing industry will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029.\n\nSo, why are Amazon shares retreating? It's got much to do with the wobbly market environment itself and even more to do with the stock's big run-up from its late-2022 low to June's high. There's a lot of opportunistic profit-taking going on here. However, that's actually a long-term opportunity for you.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDitto for Google's parent, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). That is, the stock is down since early July thanks to a combination of marketwide weakness and a second-quarter earnings stumble. Although its overall bottom line of $1.89 per share was better than expected, YouTube's revenue came up short.\n\nOh, there's also the possibility that the Department of Justice will soon be recommending a breakup of the company.\n\nIn early August, a federal court determined that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" While the company is preparing an appeal of the decision, the court is proceeding. The next stage of the process is the DOJ's proposal for a remedy, scheduled for submission no later than Sept. 4, with a meeting of all involved parties slated for Sept. 6. It's widely expected that, at the very least, the Department of Justice will ask Alphabet to divest its Chrome browser, or its Android mobile operating system, or both. The company could also be required to share more of its collected data with third parties.\n\nIt's certainly a troubling prospect on the surface. Alphabet's success largely hinges on dominating multiple facets of how people navigate the internet. Even if just one of them goes away, Google's reach is seemingly disproportionally weakened.\n\nHowever, maybe it isn't.\n\nSure, Android steers people toward the Google Play app store. Chrome and Google's online services, like Gmail and Google Docs, work very well together. Google is the default search engine on many manufacturers' connectable devices because Alphabet can afford to outbid other search engine operators for this placement.\n\nTo believe consumers won't seek out these services and tools without a nudge from Google, however, may be wishful thinking on the DOJ's part. The world loves Google's search engine because it's simple and effective. Owners of Android devices -- the world's most-used mobile operating system -- are going to find Google Play anyway. Folks like Chrome just because Chrome works well.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Department of Justice and the U.S. court system can't rattle investors more than they already have. Together or in pieces, though, Alphabet's breadwinning ad business is going to be OK.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but certainly not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of FAANG stocks to buy in September.\n\nApple shares have performed quite differently than Alphabet or Amazon have of late. While both Amazon and Apple stocks are down following sizable run-ups, Apple shares are now trading near record highs following significant stagnation between early 2022 and April of this year.\n\nWhat changed? Artificial intelligence. Although it was a bit late to the AI party, Apple is making up for lost time. In June, the company introduced what it calls \"Apple Intelligence,\" which turns Apple's newest iPhones and iPads into full-blown generative AI devices capable of handling this heavy-duty work without punting the effort to the cloud (where most consumer-friendly artificial intelligence work is currently done). This evolution is expected to reignite long-stagnant iPhone sales in terms of revenue as well as individual units.\n\nThe thing is, the launch of Apple Intelligence will likely do just that, but perhaps even more than expected. Technology market research firm IDC predicts generative-AI smartphone deliveries will swell from 234 million units this year to more than 900 million such devices in 2028, at which point AI-capable smartphones will account for nearly 80% of the global mobile phone market.\n\nAlready the world's single-most-popular smartphone, Apple's iPhone is well positioned to capture more than its fair share of this growth.\n\nThe kicker: While Apple will certainly enjoy any revenue growth stemming from the impending improvement in iPhone sales, getting the company's popular mobile phone in more consumers' hands does something else that's arguably even more fruitful. That is, it sets the stage for even more services revenue. Services is now not only Apple's second-biggest business but is also (by far) its highest-margin business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's AI Bets: 29.3% of Berkshire Hathaway's $316 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of history's most successful investors. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930, Buffett went on to deliver one of the most incredible track records of money-making wins. Since purchasing a controlling stake in Berkshire Hathaway and becoming its CEO in 1965, the Oracle of Omaha's company has delivered returns of more than 3,800,000% -- enough to turn a $1,000 investment into over $38 million.\n\nBut while Buffett is best-known as a market-crushing value investor, his company's stock portfolio actually has substantial exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) and other growth trends. If you're looking to take a page out of the famously successful investor's playbook, read on for a look at two AI stocks that account for 29.3% of Berkshire's stock holdings.\n\nHow is Buffett playing the AI stock trend?\n\nKeith Noonan: Following some volatile trading, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has roared back to once again become the world's most valuable company. With a market cap of roughly $3.44 trillion, the company actually has a significant lead on Nvidia and Microsoft -- which are valued at $3.11 trillion and $3.08 trillion, respectively.\n\nComing in at roughly 28.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's total stock portfolio, Apple is Buffett's biggest overall bet by far and the cornerstone of the company's investments in AI. But getting a read on Berkshire's AI strategy has gotten a bit harder recently.\n\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire actually sold 389 million shares of Apple stock. The move reduced the investment conglomerate's overall holdings in the tech giant by 49%.\n\nWith Apple stock reaching a new all-time high in the first half of the year, it's not shocking that Berkshire opted to take some profits, diversify its portfolio weighting, and increase its cash pile. But there may be other reasons why Buffett and his analysts opted to sell some Apple stock.\n\nIn general, Berkshire's recent moves and commentary suggest the company is taking a cautious approach to the stock market at large. There may also be some uncertainty as to what Apple's position will be in the rapidly expanding, shifting world of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe iPhone has been an incredible performance driver, and it's frequently made Apple the world's most profitable business on an annual basis over the last decade. The company has dominated the mobile hardware space and continues to look very strong overall, but AI is a disruptive technology that could shake up industry positioning. On the other hand, the strength of the iPhone also gives Apple strong foundations for AI hardware and software initiatives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the release of the iPhone Pro 16 next month, Apple will take its first big step into mobile hardware tailored for artificial intelligence. AI-focused phones look to be the next major step forward for the mobile space, and could wind up being the next growth driver for the otherwise stagnant mobile market. No other company has stronger positioning in the overall mobile space, and the industry leader will have opportunities to leverage those foundations to score big wins in artificial intelligence.\n\nAI could wind up being a powerful performance driver for Apple. But as Buffett's recent moves suggest, it may be wise not to put all your eggs in one basket at this stage in the game.\n\nAmazon has an edge in cloud computing\n\nJennifer Saibil: It has never made sense to bet against Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and these days, it looks as strong as ever. Its e-commerce business is still healthy, and it's making strides in streaming, as well as other segments, but what's really driving interest these days is the incredible opportunities in AI.\n\nAmazon isn't one to miss trends. In fact, it's more likely to grab trends and fail rather than lose the chance to become a leader in the next big thing. It's done that plenty, and that's why it now a master of many diverse and profitable businesses.\n\nAmazon has been at the forefront of AI for years, using it to power its stores business with features like product recommendations and delivery organization. Generative AI is what's creating excitement these days, and Amazon has its huge data stores to drive innovation and growth in this area. It offers a wide array of services for its Amazon Web Services clients, and it sees its edge in its three-tier system. The highest tier is services for developers to create their own large-language models (LLMs) with complete customization, the middle tier is for developers to use Amazon's LLMs for a semi-custom experience, and the lowest tier is for smaller businesses to use turnkey generative AI systems for solutions like a total marketing campaign or product images and descriptions.\n\nManagement says there's already been a robust response, with high usage of its products. And it sees this as just the beginning. CEO Andy Jassy said that over the past year and a half, Amazon has launched more than double the features of all other major cloud companies -- combined. \"This team is cooking,\" Jassy said, \"but we're not close to being done adding capabilities for our customers' interface.\"\n\nAI wouldn't normally be on Buffett's docket, and at just 0.5% of its total portfolio, Berkshire's position in Amazon isn't nearly as large as its Apple holdings. But Amazon as a company is backed up by its unbeatable e-commerce business and asset-light cloud computing segment that's also the No. 1 leader in the industry. You get the best of both worlds with Amazon: the reliable Amazon name and tremendous AI opportunities.\n\nDespite all this, Amazon stock tanked after its second-quarter earnings release, and it's trading close to its lowest valuation in years. Wall Street didn't love its sales guidance and slight miss on revenue in the second quarter. That makes this an unusual opportunity to buy this Buffett stock at a bargain price that you don't want to miss.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B): Jim Cramer’s Go-To Stock For Success",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Go-To Stocks for Success.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against Jim Cramer's other go-to stocks for success.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer offers a perspective on Nvidia and its recent market behavior on Wednesday's episode of Mad Money, presenting a straightforward analysis of the company's stock performance and the broader implications for investors. Cramer notes that owning the company's stock was easier when the company was less well-known. As the company has become a major market focus, it's attracted significant attention and criticism, which is evident after its recent financial report.\n\n\"Once you get this big, to the point where you become the focal point of the entire stock market, you're going to have a target on your back. And that's exactly what I think happened tonight to the stock after the firm reported a fine and dandy set of numbers. But fine and dandy is no longer enough for this incredible company.\"\n\nDespite reporting impressive numbers—122% revenue growth, a 152% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and a $50 billion buyback— the firm's stock fell after hours. This reaction reflects high expectations that may have become unrealistic. The stock market as a whole suffered due to pre-quarter jitters surrounding the company, with declines in major indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. The drop in the firm's stock price after the earnings report, coupled with concerns about its influence on the broader market, has led some to call this period the GPU maker's \"buzzkill quarter.\"\n\n\"The Dow declining 59 points was bad, the S&P losing 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite 1.12%. And now, with the stock sinking after hours, we could be in for a hangover from what they're already calling the company's buzzkill quarter. But the people saying this might as well be having a watch party—yes, there was one—but there's nothing to celebrate here. Move on.\"\n\nCramer emphasizes that the company's role in artificial intelligence is significant, but its overemphasis has become a burden on the market. The company's market capitalization has skyrocketed from around $500 billion to over $3 trillion in just 18 months. Cramer suggests that the company's immense importance might be overblown and that a recalibration might benefit the market.\n\n\"We know that artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and it's the best bet on AI. But the company has become an albatross around the market's neck because no one stock should be a proxy for the future of the S&P 500. Yet, that's exactly what's happened as the company has grown from around $500 billion in market cap just 18 months ago to more than $3 trillion now. Maybe after tonight, it will shed that millstone—like Apple did. You know what? That would be a godsend for all of us.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer expresses frustration with how quickly concerns about the company have spread to the broader tech sector, although he acknowledges that companies like Salesforce reported positive numbers. Cramer concludes by advising investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just tech stocks. He suggests that while diversification might seem less exciting, it is a crucial strategy to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single sector or stock.\n\n\"It felt like insult added to injury when there was no injury to the company. It will muddle through and recharge at its next iteration. Blackwell goes boring, and we see renewed expectations. I hope they don't get excessive like they were tonight.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed ten stocks he believes have significant growth potential. It also looks at how hedge funds view these stocks and ranks them based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 120\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) excels with its broad and diverse portfolio, guided by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's (now deceased) exceptional management. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)’s extensive holdings in sectors like insurance, energy, railroads, manufacturing, and consumer goods provide stability and steady cash flow, even during economic downturns. Buffett’s strategic value investing and smart capital allocation have consistently delivered high returns. With over $147 billion in cash reserves as of Q2 2024, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is in a strong position to seize investment opportunities or buy back shares, enhancing its long-term growth prospects.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) showcased robust financial performance, reporting operating earnings of $10.04 billion, up 7% from the previous year, largely due to its insurance and energy sectors. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)’s net earnings of $35.9 billion, driven by gains from major equity stakes in Apple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL),\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n\n(NYSE:KO), and American Express Company\n\n(NYSE:AXP), highlight its resilient business model and strong cash flow. Its equity portfolio, worth over $350 billion, includes investments in profitable companies and recent forays into energy infrastructure and renewable projects, positioning it well to benefit from the global move toward cleaner energy.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)’s focus on shareholder value is clear from its $8 billion share buybacks in the first half of 2024, demonstrating confidence in its intrinsic value. Recent strategic actions, such as boosting its stake in Occidental Petroleum Corporation\n\n(NYSE:OXY) and expanding into renewable energy, align with its goal to leverage opportunities in the energy sector and lead in sustainable energy. These developments reinforce a positive outlook for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)'s continued growth and value creation.\n\nOverall BRK-B ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer's go-to stocks for success.

        "title": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying",
        "content": "Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG’s estimate of 64 cents.\n\nThe gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter’s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.\n\nData center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia’s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.\n\nThird Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of strong Hopper demand.\n\nDelay of Blackwell chip rollout.\n\nThe full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.\n\nCompetition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia’s efforts.\n\nSecond to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia’s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Apple in Negotiations for Investment in OpenAI\n\nApple is reportedly exploring a significant investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, as part of a broader funding round estimated to exceed $100 billion.\n\nThrive Capital is leading this multibillion-dollar initiative, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal. Specific details about the amount Apple might contribute remain unclear.\n\nThis potential investment reflects Apple’s strategy to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, its digital assistant, with the upcoming iOS 18 update. Users will have access to these generative AI features at no additional cost.\n\nApple's interest in OpenAI marks a shift in its investment approach, as the company has historically been selective about funding startups. Traditionally, Apple has prioritized manufacturing partnerships to secure essential components for its products.\n\nHowever, the rapid evolution of AI has prompted the company to reconsider its investment strategy.\n\nIn conjunction with these discussions, Apple is preparing for an upcoming event where it is expected to introduce its next-generation iPhones. The release is anticipated to showcase new AI tools, further emphasizing Apple’s commitment to innovation in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Want to Buy the Nvidia Dip? Here Are 2 ETFs You Should Take a Look At",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.\n\nThe best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.\n\nA rising tide lifts all chipmakers\n\nNvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.\n\nFor one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.\n\nThis is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.\n\nSo, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.\n\nNvidia isn't the only megacap that has pulled back\n\nAlthough Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.\n\nCompany (Symbol) Percent Below 52-Week High Nvidia (NVDA) 10.4% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 13.7% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 1% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 2.9% Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10.2% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 23% Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) 13%\n\nData source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that these stocks have become \"cheap\" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio. If you think the pullbacks in companies like Alphabet and Amazon.com have been overdone in addition to Nvidia, this ETF could be worth a closer look right now.\n\nWhich is best for you?\n\nBoth of these are solid ETFs with reasonable fees, and the best choice for you depends on what your investment goals are and what groups of stocks you want exposure to. After Nvidia's latest earnings, if you think the recent pullback has gone a bit too far and want to invest but don't necessarily want to open a large position in Nvidia itself, these two ETFs could be smart choices for your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco Exchange-Traded Fund Trust II - Invesco Phlx Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them.

That’s why a widening range of companies will need to develop ecosystem strategies based on a clear understanding of what makes an ecosystem successful—whether they are “orchestrators” building the ecosystem, or complementors contributing to and transacting within it.\n\nTwo recent developments should prompt reflection on the dilemma between openness and control in the design of ecosystems. On the one hand, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has publicly articulated his vision of, and arguments for, an open AI ecosystem, built around the Llama model family. Albeit in a different domain, this is a striking reversal from Meta’s years-long (and notoriously costly) play for a closed, tightly controlled metaverse. On the other hand, Apple has chosen to enter the metaverse, rebranded as “spatial computing,” with a similar model of strict orchestrator control, built around its VisionPro headset. The spatial computing ecosystem that Apple hopes to foster would give it total control of the hardware and operating system that would enable complementors to sell VR and AR experiences\n\nWhat is one to make of these conflicting bets? Apple might be attempting to replicate its exceptional success with the iPhone, leveraging its mettle in creating a user-friendly interface to lock in consumers. However, we argue that an orchestrator’s belief that it must create and control everything itself is, more often than not, a cardinal sin of ecosystem design. Indeed, the lessons from Meta’s foray into the metaverse remain valuable, and applicable beyond web3. First: Total openness and absolute dominance pose a false dilemma for ecosystem orchestrators. And second: Complementors have power to shape the trajectory of a viable, scalable ecosystem.\n\nMeta’s bitter lesson\n\nA decade or so ago, it was Facebook that aspired to extend its social media dominance into a new, orchestrator-dominated virtual realm. The company began pouring resources into building an insular ecosystem where it could exercise total control. It developed its own proprietary devices to offer augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, bought headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, and, as recently as 2021, launched a social VR space called Horizon Worlds. The finishing touch, and a powerful statement of intent, was to rebrand itself as Meta.\n\nThe belief that the metaverse had arrived triggered a gold rush, as tech giants like Microsoft and Apple raced to construct their own immersion-focused ecosystems. But fast-forward a few years and reality has fallen far short of the hype. By 2023, two years after its launch, Meta’s Horizon Worlds had fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, and only 9% of its worlds had been visited by more than 50 people. Meanwhile, U.S. sales of VR headsets and AR glasses crashed, plummeting nearly 40% to $664 million in 2023. That understandably dismayed content creators who were paying fees of up to 47.5% to sell their virtual goods on the platform, shrinking the incentive for these complementors to invest in creating added-value content.\n\nHumbled, Meta belatedly acknowledged that collaboration might ultimately be a better course; it opened up the operating system that powers its line of MetaQuest VR devicesearlier this year. This shift enabled third-party hardware makers to build mixed reality (MR) experiences. Meta also allowed “pre-approved” partners to develop specific use cases: hardware manufacturer Asus would develop a gaming headset under its Republic of Gamers brand, while Lenovo developed MR devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment. In 2022, Meta struck a partnership with Microsoft to bring the immersive tools of Mesh for Microsoft Teams to MetaQuest devices.\n\nMeta’s current approach represents a middle ground between open and closed ecosystems and has allowed it to entice complementors while still controlling who can use its operating system and (to some extent) what for.\n\nModels of ecosystem-building\n\nMeta’s change of heart shows that there’s more than one way for orchestrators to attract and benefit from complementors in their ecosystems. Meta first aspired to a “hardware lock,” where users are locked into proprietary devices, but third parties can create content for them. Microsoft, meanwhile, aimed even higher with its own metaverse play: a “total lock,” where both hardware and software are under the orchestrator’s control.\n\nApple’s strategy is somewhere in between: A hardware lock, with selective and limited opening for complementors. Other companies are exploring different paths: Blockchain game developer Axie pursued a “content lock” where it controlled content creation, but was device-agnostic; and Decentraland, a truly “open platform,” is not only device-agnostic but actively encourages content creation by multiple third parties.\n\nDrawing on our recent research project on the metaverse, we looked at the approaches different orchestrators took, and found that, as a rule, firms that tried to control too much were unable to generate complementor support and ultimately failed. It makes sense then that we’re seeing a broader trend of orchestrators giving up on this “orchestrator takes all” approach and embracing partnerships that instead multiply use cases and drive user adoption.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Apple’s gamble on the sort of hardware-lock, high-fee, and tightly- controlled-content strategy that Meta abandoned will pay off. But for now, it is predictably struggling to entice participation. None of YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix currently offers a dedicated app for Apple’s Vision Pro headset. In fact, 46 of the most popular apps on Apple’s App Store weren’t available on Vision Pro’s launch day. These complementors are tight-lipped on why they’re staying away, but their reluctance is already having an impact, undermining the appeal of Apple’s high-quality user hardware and user experience, and reportedly prompting Apple to cut production targets for the Vision Pro.\n\nLessons for ecosystem participants\n\nEven though Big Tech giants may be tempted to leverage their extraordinary power to impose their will onto a new ecosystem, this not only thwarts complementors—it can often endanger ecosystem success. An effective ecosystem strategy does not always benefit from hardball tactics, as Meta’s own evolution shows. Through its strategic pivot, Meta now hopes to address the two biggest drawbacks to extended reality: sluggish hardware development and clunky experiences that few users enjoy. To do that the company is now betting on the future of an interconnected, interoperable metaverse, and gunning for first-mover advantage when it comes to setting standards for transferable digital identities. And these lessons are now being carried over into Meta’s play in the generative AI space as well.\n\nOpening up the ecosystem means making the social layer within the Horizon OS that powers its Horizon Worlds more appealing to users by allowing profiles to glide seamlessly between virtual spaces, giving them ownership of their virtual identities. Meta’s calculation is that if Horizon OS becomes the engine of users’ social experiences everywhere, the company can harvest customer data and strengthen its existing market position in digital advertising.\n\nEcosystem complementors, that is, the partners who are struggling to compete in a world of tech giants, still have power to influence the ecosystems in which they operate—most importantly, by refusing to do so. For complementors, strategic alignment can substitute for tech power, and clever positioning can make a difference.\n\nIn the new growth area of GenAI-enabled ecosystems, getting the ecosystem strategy right will be crucial for complementors and orchestrators alike. As we’ve argued before, the locus of innovation and investment will overtime move downstream, towards small, domain-specific models that numerous companies will be best positioned to develop “on top” of the foundation models created by leading GenAI startups and hyperscalers.\n\n***\n\nThe metaverse itself is far from dead. In fact, the spatial computing race has only just begun. Which ecosystem-building strategy will prevail: Meta with its new semi-open strategy, or Apple and its “total lock” hardware approach? Or will it be another orchestrator that already dominates the metaverse, like the online game platform Roblox, with 60 million daily active users? One thing is for certain: Orchestrators will have to become much more sophisticated and nuanced in how they run their ecosystems—whether in the virtual world or the real one.\n\nRead other Fortune columns by François Candelon.\n\nFrançois Candelon is a partner at private equity firm Seven2 and the former global director of the BCG Henderson Institute.\n\nMichael G.

        "content": "Investing in promising, up-and-coming growth stocks can lead to significant returns for buy-and-hold investors. You don't need to invest a fortune into a growth stock to make a lot of money -- if you pick the right one -- but it can require a lot of patience.\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) have each turned four-figure investments into more than $1 million during the course of a couple of decades. Here's a look at how they've done so well, and what a $6,000 investment in these stocks 20 years ago would be worth right now for an investor who had held on.\n\nApple: $2.5 million\n\nSteve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone back in 2007 and it has been a monumental game changer for Apple's business ever since. Not only have Apple's loyal customers come back over and over again for new iterations of the device over the years, but it has been the primary hardware foundation upon which a huge and growing ecosystem of services has been built. While iPhone and iPad sales are still the company's bread and butter, it makes an increasing share of revenue from services, and that could continue to be a growth catalyst for years to come.\n\nDuring the past two decades, Apple has been a phenomenal growth stock to own, turning a $6,000 investment 20 years ago into $2.5 million today. AAPL Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nDespite its growth into one of the world's most valuable company, Apple's stock still isn't egregiously expensive. It trades at 34 times its trailing earnings, and with AI-capable phones coming soon, there's still reason to remain excited about the company's growth prospects.\n\nNetflix: $1.8 million\n\nNetflix has reconfigured itself several times during the past couple of decades. In the early 2000s, its video rental business was based on mailing physical DVDs to customers. Then it transitioned into streaming and being a curator of content from a wide variety of studios. But as more of those companies have launched their own streaming services, Netflix has pivoted once again to making its own content. Although it still has movies and shows from other entertainment companies, it's not as dependent on them anymore.\n\nAnd while many other content producers are struggling to make their own streaming services profitable, Netflix has accomplished that. Although consumers may not be thrilled with its subscription price hikes, they have paid off; Netflix's profits have soared at even faster levels than Apple's. NFLX Revenue (Annual) ChartNFLX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nA $6,000 investment in Netflix 20 years ago would now be worth a staggering $1.8 million. The stock is a bit expensive, trading at more than 42 times trailing earnings. But for a top streaming company, that may be a justifiable premium to pay, especially as it expands deeper into ad-supported plans, which will likely open up even more growth opportunities for Netflix.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking Holdings: $1.1 million\n\nBooking Holdings has become one of the largest travel technology companies in the world. Its portfolio includes many popular travel booking sites, including Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights.com, and others to complement its flagship site, Booking.com.\n\nDemand for travel continues to rise along with population growth, making travel stocks fairly attractive investments to buy and hold, and Booking Holdings is no exception. Although the pandemic put a serious dent in the company's profit, Booking Holdings has bounced back, and its growth prospects remain promising. BKNG Revenue (Annual) ChartBKNG Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nAn investment of $6,000 into Booking Holdings two decades ago would now be worth about $1.1 million. Trading at 27 times earnings and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) multiple of just 1.1, this is the best-valued growth stock on this list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Has 31% of His $8.7 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "There's little question that one of the driving forces behind the ongoing bull market is the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and the poster child for that shifting paradigm is Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computational horsepower needed for AI and have quickly become the gold standard. As a result, Nvidia continues to deliver quarter after quarter of record-setting results, which has sent its stock price soaring.\n\nHowever, some investors are concerned that growing competition and the stock's lofty valuation make Nvidia increasingly risky. Consequently, these same investors are looking for other ways to profit from the AI revolution. One place to look for other ideas is among the holdings of successful hedge fund managers.\n\nOne such money manager is Daniel Loeb. The billionaire heads up Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb turned seed money of just $3.4 billion -- raised from family and friends -- into a financial empire with assets under management of $12 billion.\n\nLoeb has left no doubt about the potential implications of AI, calling it \"transformational\" and ultimately sparking a \"profound economic upheaval.\" In fact, the famed investor is so bullish about AI that it's the \"key element of the thesis for nearly half\" the hedge funds stock holdings. Just four stocks make up his largest AI investments. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.4% of holdings\n\nThird Point's largest AI holding -- and largest position overall -- is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that he has held continuously since 2019. He notes that AI favors incumbents like Amazon \"who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race.\"\n\nHe's clearly done his homework. Amazon quickly positioned itself to capitalize on the AI opportunity, offering a roster of the most in-demand AI models to its cloud customers, while also creating its own, but that's just the beginning. Amazon is using AI to identify and store inventory 75% more quickly while bringing down order processing times by 25%, giving its legacy online retail business a boost. The company also uses AI to better address the target audience for its digital ads.\n\nLoeb's Amazon position remained unchanged in the second quarter, with a total stake of 5.1 million shares worth about $986 million and nearly 11% of Third Point's portfolio. And at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is an attractively priced way to play the AI revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a longtime Amazon shareholder, I'm completely on board with Loeb. Not only is Amazon the leading provider of e-commerce and cloud computing, but it's also a growing power player in digital advertising. Adding AI into the mix gives Amazon another way to win when the odds are already stacked in its favor.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 8.1% of holdings\n\nThird Point's second-largest AI holding and third-largest overall is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Loeb views the software giant as one of the \"best-run legacy\" companies, which has \"built enormous competitive advantages\" and is well positioned to benefit from the adoption of AI.\n\nHis logic is irrefutable. Like Amazon, Microsoft offers a wealth of AI models to cloud customers. However, the company's biggest AI opportunity is likely Copilot, Microsoft's suite of AI-powered digital assistants. Designed for a variety of industries and tasks, Copilot can streamline tasks and automate time-consuming chores, thereby increasing productivity. Demand for Copilot has been robust and has also helped boost the adoption of its cloud services. Microsoft's noted in the calendar second quarter that eight points of Azure Cloud's growth were the result of AI services.\n\nThird Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 11% in the second quarter, likely to expand its exposure to other AI stocks (more on that shortly).\n\nMicrosoft stock is selling for a premium at 38 times earnings. However, the company's strong legacy businesses and early positioning in AI show it's deserving of a premium.\n\nI'm a firm believer that Microsoft has a long runway ahead. Generative AI will continue to evolve and Copilot is an early mover in the space. When added to the company's existing businesses, AI gives Microsoft an extraordinary competitive advantage -- which is why I own the stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.4% of holdings\n\nLoeb's third largest AI holding and fourth overall is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Loeb hasn't been as vocal about his position in the tech giant but is likely bullish on the recovery in digital advertising, as targeted ads on its social media platforms generate 98% of its revenue. However, Meta also made a surprising move to capitalize on AI, which likely also informed Loeb's decision.\n\nMeta moved into AI contention by quickly developing its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), an AI model that is carried by all the major cloud platforms for a fee. This AI system is fueled by a treasure trove of data from the billions of users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger. AI is a new revenue stream for Meta, so we don't yet know how lucrative it might ultimately be.\n\nThird Point's stake in Meta amounts to 1.1 million shares worth roughly $555 million. Similar to Microsoft, Loeb trimmed his position in the second quarter by about 11%, likely to spread his AI bets (more on this below).\n\nThe stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nI'm equally bullish on Meta Platforms. I think the company's move to leverage its user data to create AI models was nothing short of brilliant. Add to that Meta's ever-expanding advertising prowess and you have the recipe for long-term success.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 4: Apple -- 4.7% of holdings\n\nThere was a notable addition to Third Point's portfolio last quarter, that of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Loeb loaded up, acquiring nearly 2 million shares of the iPhone maker in a stake valued at roughly $411 million and representing nearly 5% of his portfolio.\n\nLoeb noted that while some investors fear Apple may \"be an AI loser,\" he takes a different view. He cited the company's 2.2 billion devices and wide selection of electronic devices as an advantage and believes \" AI-related demand could drive a step-change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years.\" He further suggests that the company's recently announced Apple Intelligence -- a suite of AI-powered smartphone features -- will drive \"meaningful demand\" from Apple's installed base.\n\nInvestor sentiment has weighed on Apple stock since early last year, as some fear that AI had left the company behind, but I think that view is myopic. Apple has a long history of taking the time to put its unique stamp on its products and services, which has helped make it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Investors who dismiss Apple do so at their own peril.\n\nThe biggest opportunity?\n\nI own all four of these AI-centric stocks and believe they're all worth owning, but two stand out, albeit for different reasons.\n\nSince generative AI kicked off in earnest early last year, Apple stock has gained just 62%, the lowest among our quartet of stocks. Investors are waiting to see what the iPhone maker will unveils during its next product update on September 9. This could be the catalyst Apple needs to send its shares higher.\n\nStrictly from a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms remains the most attractively priced, at less than 26 times earnings, compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.\n\nThat said, each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity in the AI revolution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here's Why Nvidia's New $50 Billion Buyback May Bolster the Bear Case for the Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal second-quarter earnings report is out, and it appears the chipmaker is raking in massive sums of cash. Revenue for the period was $30 billion, up 122% year over year. Even more, earnings per share soared 168% to $0.67. Further, free cash flow for the quarter was about $13.5 billion, up from approximately $6.0 billion in the year-ago period.\n\n\"NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,\" said Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang in the company's quarterly report.\n\nAll of this is great. But in the context of Nvidia's nearly $3 trillion market capitalization, it's not as impressive. Herein lies the problem with Nvidia stock: The valuation may simply be a bit ahead of itself. One telling way to further highlight this is by taking a look at the company's share repurchase program and viewing it next to its massive market cap.\n\nEverything is relative\n\nNvidia repurchased $15.4 billion worth of its shares over the last two quarters. This would leave $7.5 billion of authorized cash for further repurchases, except the company just announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $50 billion for repurchases.\n\nSure, $50 billion is a huge sum. But it's a bit small in the context of Nvidia's approximately $3 trillion market cap. Even when you add in the $7.5 billion it still has from its previous program, total outstanding cash authorized for repurchases amounts to less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap.\n\nCompare this to the $60 billion authorization Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) announced when it got serious about share repurchases in 2013. This amounted to nearly 16% of the company's shares outstanding at the time. Fast forward to Apple's first full quarter following this authorization and the company spent $11 billion buying back its stock. And what was Apple's market cap at the time? Around $400 billion. In contrast, Nvidia spent just about $7.2 billion in its most recent quarter repurchasing shares even though the company's market capitalization amounts to about $3 trillion today.\n\nIn one final comparison with Apple, Nvidia's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently total $34.8 billion, or just over 1% of the company's market capitalization; yet Apple's cash at the time it got serious about repurchases was $147 billion, or more than a third of its market capitalization.\n\nIn short, Nvidia's underwhelming repurchase program (and cash balance to support it) relative to its market capitalization arguably draws attention to the fact that its valuation may be a bit inflated.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestionable timing\n\nThe other issue with Nvidia's repurchase program is the timing. With shares trading at around 55 times earnings, the stock may have already priced in the continued upside for this cyclical business. Repurchasing shares at a potentially fair or overvalued price isn't always in the best interest of shareholders. It may be better for Nvidia to hold onto cash and buy back its stock if it were available for a better price -- a price that looks like a clear discount to a conservative estimate of the stock's intrinsic value.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's business performance is worth applauding. It's incredible how the company has innovated and executed to capitalize on the demand for AI-fueled products and services. Further, the company's growth rate and profitability is astounding. Still, none of this addresses the key concern investors should have: Valuation.\n\nSure, it's possible that the company easily grows into its valuation. But the cyclical nature of semiconductor businesses and the industry's long history of intense competition warrant some caution at the stock's current price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is considering options to weather a historic slump, which include potentially splitting off its foundry business and scrapping plans for new factories, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nThe chipmaker is in talks with investment bankers over potential options and has met with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) over a path forward, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIntel had earlier in August suspended its dividend and slashed about 15% of its workforce, as it struggled to catch up with rivals in the foundry space, chiefly Taiwan's TSMC (NYSE:TSM).\n\nOnce the world's leading chipmaker, Intel fell on hard times in the 2000's, amid increased competition from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and as it struggled to keep pace with demands from the smartphone and mobile computing industry.\n\nApple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) decision to develop its own silicon and stop using Intel chips was also a major blow to the chipmaker.\n\nIntel's challenges came to a head in recent years, with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence further cutting Intel's sales.\n\nThe Bloomberg report showed that Intel was now considering separating its product design and foundry business, while also scrapping plans for expansion as it seeks to streamline its operations.\n\nThe company could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIntel considers splitting off foundry business, scrapping factory plans- Bloomberg\n\nAsia stocks rise but still set for August losses; PCE data awaited\n\nUber CEO says growth in South Korea promising despite underdog status\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\n\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Top AI Pick for 2025\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company was recently named the top artificial intelligence stock pick going into 2025 by investment bank Citi. In an investor note, the analysts covering AI at the bank highlighted that early developer feedback on iOS 18, the latest software for iPhones, with beta AI features, had been positive, including the recently launched feature to remove unwanted objects with AI. Per the analysts, this would provide consumers with a compelling reason to upgrade their iPhones. The investor note also eased concerns around the transition to a new CFO and the antitrust case against Google, backing the firm to emerge stronger from the challenges.\n\nLatest reports indicate that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be cutting around 100 jobs in the services department of the firm amid a shift to new AI priorities. The majority of the job cuts are expected in the Apple Books and Apple Bookstore departments. The move is widely seen as a larger plan by the firm to reorganize around artificial intelligence offerings, the most recent of which was the launch of Apple Intelligence earlier this year.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints Intergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness Dense Cities With Low Emissions Suffer Most From Air Pollution, Study Finds As Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow A Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\n\nApple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The round would be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.\n\nIf the discussions move forward, it would mean the three most valuable tech companies are all backing OpenAI, maker of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft was already OpenAI’s biggest funder, having invested roughly $13 billion.\n\nApple has existing ties with OpenAI as well. The iPhone maker is integrating ChatGPT into its new suite of AI features, called Apple Intelligence. Apple also was slated to take a board observer seat at OpenAI — alongside Microsoft — though those plans were dropped in July.\n\nNvidia, meanwhile, supplies the critical infrastructure needed to develop and run AI tools like ChatGPT. It’s the biggest maker of so-called AI accelerators, sales of which have soared in the past two years.\n\nRepresentatives for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI and Thrive all declined to comment.\n\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees in a memo Wednesday that the company was seeking fresh capital, without giving details, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been in discussions to raise funding at a valuation at or above $100 billion since at least December, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nThe financing would bolster one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed startups. The runaway success of ChatGPT also has kicked off an arms race among tech companies, which are integrating AI technology across their products and funding other promising startups.\n\nIn her memo to employees, Friar said that OpenAI would use the financing to acquire more computing power and fund other operating expenses, the people said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions with Apple.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports How Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Far-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks US Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\n\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Billionaire Dan Loeb Expects AI-Linked Revenue Growth\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent weeks after legendary investor Warren Buffett reduced his holdings in the company significantly during the second quarter of 2024. However, even as some take flight, others have been doubling down on their bets. For example, Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund led by Dan Loeb, recently revealed that it had bought nearly 550,000 shares in the tech giant. Loeb, in a letter to investors, highlighted his bullish views on the company in the field of artificial intelligence. Apple introduced Apple Intelligence earlier this year, a suite of software products designed to make Apple devices like iPhones AI capable.\n\nLoeb underlined that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would drive meaningful new demand within the installed base with the release of AI features, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. He detailed that iPhone revenue was going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features would not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Furthermore, per Loeb, the App Store was likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Beginner Stock You Should Check Out",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other beginner stocks.\n\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\n\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\n\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\n\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\n\nOpportunities and Caution for New Investors Due to Consumer Behaviour\n\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\n\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven’t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\n\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven’t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\n\nThe Market is Healthy but Caution is Advised\n\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\n\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\n“According to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\n\nAccording to Bruce Kasman, global growth is steady at 2.4%, with improved recoveries in Western Europe and emerging markets, along with a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Despite this, core global inflation is projected to remain around 3% in 2024, which could limit the potential for policy easing. Kasman warned that achieving inflation control and rate normalization might weaken demand and could interact with political factors to cause further inflation and central bank tightening.”\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 8.03%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a prominent American multinational technology company and is known for its groundbreaking consumer electronics, software, and services. The company first gained recognition with the launch of its Apple I personal computer.\n\nOver the years, the company has transformed into one of the world’s most valuable brands, renowned for its flagship products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. In addition to its hardware, it offers a range of digital services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Pay, and AppleCare. It is fourth on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has long been a significant player in the technology sector, and it is set to build on its position with an ambitious push into generative AI. While AI has been part of the company's ecosystem for years, through the Siri virtual assistant, it is ready to better its AI capabilities with the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe new suite of features, expected within the year, will introduce a refreshed Siri interface and offer functionalities such as email summarization, content rewriting in various tones, and phone call transcriptions. Future updates will include integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which further expands its AI capabilities.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been integrating AI accelerators into its M-series processors from the start, which positions the company uniquely in the tech landscape. By making Apple Intelligence compatible with all Apple Silicon Macs, iPads with M-series processors, Vision Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and future iPhones, the company will likely possess the largest base of AI-capable devices. Its devices, powered by the M-series and A17 Pro processors, will possibly be able to handle complex AI tasks directly on the device rather than relying on cloud computing.\n\nIn addition to these advancements, the company remains a high-margin leader in the tech industry. In the third quarter, it saw a 5% increase in net sales, reaching $85.8 billion. This growth was fueled by a 14% rise in services revenue and substantial iPhone sales, which totaled $39.3 billion.\n\nWith its continued innovation in AI and robust financial performance, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. The expansion of AI functionalities across its product lineup and impressive sales figures highlight the company's ongoing potential and strategic direction.\n\nIn the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with total positions worth $124.175 billion. With 400 million shares worth $84.248 billion, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the most prominent shareholder in the company, as of June 30.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Believes Will Soar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar.\n\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer reflects on Wall Street's favorite GPU maker's remarkable journey and current status in the stock market. After the sharp decline three weeks ago, caused by the sudden sell-off linked to the yen carry trade, the market is rebounding.\n\n\"We’ve had a remarkable run from the lows three weeks ago as we realized that the forced selling caused by the implosion of the yen carry trade is merely temporary.\"\n\nCramer notes that the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cuts should support this recovery. However, Wall Street has become more selective, and investors are less forgiving of mediocre results now that the market has rallied significantly.\n\n\"Now the Fed is our friend again with rate cuts on the way, starting at next month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At the same time, though, after such a spectacular rally, Wall Street’s gotten a little more discerning. Investors are no longer willing to give companies a pass for less-than-stellar results once we reach more elevated levels. That’s what happens—the exuberance goes away. Now we’re in a tricky moment that feels like a race against time.\"\n\nCramer emphasizes that the current economic climate is uncertain. The economy is slowing, and while the Fed's rate cuts are expected to help, their impact is unpredictable. The effectiveness of these measures and the extent of the economic downturn remain unclear.\n\n\"While the economy is slowing and we know the Fed rate-cut cavalry is riding to the rescue, we just don’t know how effective it will be and how bad things will get before Fed Chief Powell manages to turn the tide—and he will. We need to figure out how quickly the economy will deteriorate and how quickly the rate cuts will work their magic. Both of these are judgment calls, and we don’t necessarily have enough data to decide either way. We never do at this point in what we call the economic cycle.\"\n\nJim Cramer: In my 43 Years on Wall Street, I’ve Never Seen Anything Like This\n\nAccording to Cramer, Nvidia has captured extraordinary attention from investors. He describes it as a groundbreaking company, now valued at $3.2 trillion, a dramatic increase from $580 billion just 18 months ago. Cramer highlights its dominance in the semiconductor industry and its influence on technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.\n\n\"I searched for comparisons and came up grasping at something ethereal to describe this incredible $3.2 trillion company, which was worth just $580 billion 18 months ago. It has captivated not just investors but people far removed from the stock market. It’s almost miraculous how many have had life-changing experiences because of this single stock.\"\n\nDespite its impressive achievements, Cramer notes that the stock's performance will be scrutinized closely. He points out that the company's quarterly results need to surpass high expectations, including significant revenue beats and strong future guidance.\n\n\"But tomorrow, the stock will descend into mere mortality, and I feel compelled to explain why. Why does it hold such a high status, and why can it never fully live up to the hype of its $3.2 trillion market cap based solely on one quarterly report? The quarter is about it beating earnings estimates, topping revenue numbers, and crushing forecasts. The stock has run so high that it needs a $2 billion revenue beat and guidance that’s $2 billion higher than expected, along with a bullish conference call discussing a strong roadmap. And let’s not forget a gigantic buyback because the company has too much cash sitting idle.\"\n\nCramer concludes that the company's technology is so advanced that it’s difficult to fully grasp its future potential. Despite this, he believes the company's achievements should be celebrated, and the stock might still hold significant upside surprises.\n\n\"The bottom line: I don’t want to be poetic, but it excels in ways that are unmatched. We should celebrate its achievements and bring on those upside surprises.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we examine a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks with strong potential for growth. We also analyze hedge fund perspectives on these stocks and rank them according to hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer addresses recent changes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s leadership, specifically the retirement of CFO Luca Maestri, a highly regarded executive known for his exceptional financial stewardship. Despite initial market reactions that saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock dip slightly and prompted some to view the change with concern, Cramer remains confident in the company's future. Maestri’s tenure saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s revenue and earnings grow significantly, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s market cap soaring from $547 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion.\n\n\"Apple's C-suite is being shaken up, but I'll tell you why it's not shaking my confidence in the company going forward. Own it, don't trade it. Apple's stock briefly got rocked this morning after we learned that CFO Luca Maestri, one of the best in the business, is retiring. Luca is a hero. He's been the steward of Apple's cash and has done his best to add value for all shareholders, much better than almost every other CFO out there. So what happens to the stock upon the news of his retirement? It goes down a buck and a half in pre-market trading, and we get a host of notes saying that Luca's decision is either a mild negative for the stock or a real negative—a reason to be worried and a cause of disappointment and concern.\n\nIt's been 10 years for Luca, a little longer than the average CFO term, during which Apple's revenues have compounded at an 8% annual clip, while its earnings compounded at a 15% clip. Apple's market capitalization expanded more than six times, from $547 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion today. Luca has been incredible at planning the success of the service revenue stream, which is now close to $100 billion. He's helped grow the company in key emerging markets like India, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, and the UAE, which together are becoming a real force. I'd argue he's been a genius when it comes to buying back stock, always purchasing it when it's right, not just repurchasing shares by rote, as most CFOs do...\n\nIn the midst of an endless parade of commentators who want you to trade, many of whom make money if you trade, there is Apple—the one and only stock that's run the way you want a company to run, which is why I always say own it, don't trade it. I can't think of a thing Apple does wrong when it comes to running the business day-to-day, and I know that Luca played a big role in that.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nShares in chip company Nvidia fell in after-hours trading, following second quarter earnings which showed the smallest revenue beat in six quarters.\n\nNvidia was down nearly 7% in pre-market trading, despite the chipmaker reporting second quarter figures that beat expectations on the top and bottom line after the US bell on Wednesday.\n\nThe company, a world leader in chip design and software, reported revenues of $30bn (£22.7bn) in its fiscal second quarter, compared to analysts' forecasts of $28.8bn.\n\nBen Barringer, technology and media analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nvidia has grown to a point where there is little room for error and any sign of slowing or normalisation of growth will have an outsized effect on the share price.”\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks higher as Nvidia shares fall despite record sales\n\n“This being the smallest beat in six quarters, and the fact guidance for gross margins and costs are weaker was enough to get people to hit the sell button in after hours trading.”\n\nTech stocks led US markets lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the highly-anticipated results, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closing 1.1% down.\n\nSalesforce (CRM)\n\nSoftware company Salesforce posted second quarter results after the US market close on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins and earnings.\n\nSalesforce posted net sales of $9.33bn for the second quarter, above an estimate of $9.23bn.\n\nShares popped in after-hours trading, up 5%.\n\nSales increased 11% in Europe, 16% in Asia-Pacific, and 8% in its Americas segment in the second quarter. This marked a turnaround from the previous quarter when the company posted its first sales estimate miss since 2006.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\n\"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin,” Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company also reported an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, coming in above estimates of 31.94%.\n\n“Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history,\" Miner said.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)\n\nShares in Warren Buffet’s company were trending in pre-market trading as it hit $1tn (£756bn) in market value — the first US company outside of the tech sector to reach the milestone.\n\nThe $1tn threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffet turns 94 years old.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway comprises a $285bn stock portfolio that Buffett has built up over six decades, making him one of the richest people in the world.\n\nIn recent months, Berkshire Hathaway has been in selling mode. It cut its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 50% last quarter. On Tuesday, the company disclosed it had sold nearly 25 million Bank of America (BAC) shares worth close to $1bn.\n\nRead more: The top FTSE 100 winners and losers of 2024 so far\n\nBerkshire’s insurance, energy, manufacturing, retail and service businesses generated $22.8bn of profit in the first half of the year, up 26% from a year earlier.\n\nTopping the list of the most valuable companies are Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), which all are worth more than $3tn. Other companies trading above $1tn include Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI)\n\nShares in the AI server maker were almost 7% lower in pre-market trading after plunging over 19% during Wednesday’s session after it said it would delay the filing of its annual report.\n\n″SMCI is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense,” the company said. “Additional time is needed for SMCI’s management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of 30 June 2024.”\n\nThat announcement came a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report that alleged it found “glaring accounting red flags” and other issues at the company.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said some of Hindenburg’s claims are “tough to verify” and that the report is “largely void of details around alleged wrong doings from the company”.\n\nHindenburg Research said its three-month investigation found \"evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues\". The firm disclosed on Tuesday that it had taken a short position in Super Micro.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "A bounce-back quarter for Salesforce (CRM).\n\nShares of the SaaS company popped 4% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as it bested Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins, and earnings.\n\nThe reaction — and tone around the quarter's performance — is in stark contrast to just three months ago, when the company shockingly missed sales estimates for the first time since 2006.\n\nDemand remains strong, and there are \"big goals\" for operating margins and cash flow, Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance.\n\nSales increased 11% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. The company's Americas segment notched 8% sales growth.\n\n\"I don't think anyone expected a repeat performance of that [last quarter],\" Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdded Miner, \"What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin. Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history.\"\n\nThe company maintained its full year sales outlook, but lifted its expectations for operating margins. That may spur enthusiasm that Salesforce's various AI initiatives will boost profits.\n\nTo that end, Benioff teased the coming launch of AgentForce, which features AI sales agents that go beyond chatbots and can resolve customer inquiries. Benioff says more details will be shared in September at the company's closely watched Dreamforce conference.\n\nBut he tells me the service is a higher margin opportunity and will be priced by conversation. Benioff envisions one billion agents in service by the end of fiscal year 2026.\n\nHe also says Microsoft has \"misled\" customers \"that they have to do so much heavy lifting on the technology side.\" Salesforce aims to enable customers to train their models within its platform.\n\n\"They get real value from AI now,\" he says of Salesforce's offerings.\n\n\"One of the biggest initiatives in the field is around monetizing the AI theme within the Salesforce massive installed base. We believe this is a major land grab opportunity that could significantly benefit Salesforce over the coming years and could increase overall revenue by $4 billion+ annually based on our estimates and field work by 2025,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.\n\nThe earnings rundown\n\nNet Sales: $9.33 billion (+8% year over year) vs. $9.23 billion estimate (guidance: $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion Current Remaining Performance Obligations: $26.5 billion vs. $26.31 billion Adjusted Operating Margin: 33.7% vs. 31.94% estimate Diluted EPS: $2.56 (+21% year over year) vs. $2.35 estimate\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat else caught our attention: the outlook\n\nFull-Year Sales Guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion vs. $37.84 billion estimate (prior guidance: $37.7 billion to $38 billion) Full-Year Operating Margin Guidance: 32.8% vs 32.52% estimate (prior guidance: 32.5%)\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — If you want to use your shiny new iPhone for as long as possible, you better take good care of it.\n\nMost people are now holding on to smartphones longer instead of regularly upgrading them, and there are many reasons why.\n\nAt the dawn of the smartphone age, you might have upgraded to a new device every few years to make sure you had the latest must-have features or because your carrier's contract subsidized the purchase of the newest model. But that's no longer the case as smartphone technology has matured and innovations have become more incremental, and carrier pricing models have changed.\n\nThere's also an environmental push to keep old phones out of landfills as electronic waste becomes a larger sustainability issue. Smartphones these days are also just sturdier and better able to survive dunks and shocks.\n\n“As long as you take care of your phone and keep it updated, you’re going to get at least four or five good years of use out of it,\" said Chris Hauk, of Pixel Privacy, a tech website. Some device owners boast in online forums that they've had phones last more than seven years.\n\nAnd if you're paying over $1,000 for your smartphone, you'll probably want to it to last as long as it can. Here are some tips to extend the lifespan of your Apple or Android mobile device:\n\nBattery care\n\nOne of the biggest factor in your phone's lifespan is the battery. A rechargeable battery's chemical age isn't related to when it was manufactured. Instead, it's based on a complex mix of factors including “temperature history and charging pattern,” according to Apple.\n\n“As lithium-ion batteries chemically age, the amount of charge they can hold diminishes, resulting in reduced battery life and reduced peak performance,” the iPhone maker says.\n\nThe company says its charging optimization technology is designed to improve battery life, and it’s safe for iPhone users to charge their phones overnight.\n\nSamsung, meanwhile, says its lithium ion batteries do best when kept above 50% charge. It advises against running the battery down.\n\n“Repeatedly allowing the battery to drain fully may shorten its life and decrease its overall capacity,” the company says in an online guide. “If this happens, you’ll need to charge the battery more frequently and it may last only a few hours before needing a charge, for example.”\n\nAvoid extreme temperatures\n\nApple says says that batteries warm up as they charge, which can shorten their lifespan. It warns against using your phone or charging it in very hot temperatures, above 95 degrees (35 Celsius), “which can permanently reduce battery lifespan.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung also says extreme heat or cold can damage batteries and warns people not to, for example, leave their phones in a car's glove box when it's very hot or cold. And don't put your phone in a freezer either, it's a myth that it can prolong battery life. “This is not correct and can damage your battery,” Samsung says.\n\nGoogle, which makes the Android operating system and Pixel phones, says hot batteries drain faster, even when they're not in use, and that can damage the battery.\n\nAdjust your power options\n\nTweak your device settings so apps or features use less power, which extends your battery's daily life and the time between charging cycles.\n\nYou can turn down your phone's screen brightness, turn on the dark theme and reduce the time for the screen to power off. Enable the auto-brightness feature, which adjusts screen brightness according to the level of ambient light. Also check battery usage in your settings to see if there are any power-hungry apps you can switch off or uninstall.\n\nIf the power level dips below 10%, iPhone users can turn on low power mode to stretch their battery's life before it need recharging. Samsung's Android phones have a similar “power saving mode.” You can also leave it on all the time, but it might affect your phone's performance.\n\nSamsung says users can switch off Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if they’re not being used, although Apple advises leaving them on because they draw minimal power when not connected.\n\nUse protection\n\nPhones are sleek capsules but the glossy surface means they can slip easily out of your hand. So it goes without saying that you should get a sturdy protective case to help cushion the blow when you accidentally drop it.\n\nDon't forget a screen protector. Plastic versions are the cheapest option but can scuff easily, according to device repair website iFixit, which recommends ones made with TPU film or tempered glass, which offer better protection against scratches and drops.\n\nKeep your device clean\n\nKeeping your phone in your pocket or purse means its ports and sockets can collect lint and other debris that you'll need to clean out.\n\n“Take a little toothpick and just kind of get in and get rid of any debris,” said Hauk. \"Also the speaker and the microphone grills on phones, they do get dirty,” so use a toothbrush to clean them, he said. Just make sure you're flicking the debris away from the phone instead of pushing it deeper inside the tiny holes.\n\nUpdate your device\n\nSoftware is another important factor in a phone's lifespan. Experts advise keeping your operating system and apps up to date so they have the latest privacy, security and battery management features.\n\nThat will be easier to do as your phone ages because some device makers have been extending the time limit for providing updates.\n\nGoogle has pledged to provide Pixel 8 and newer phones with seven years of Android and security updates, compared with four to five years for older models. Samsung has also extended its operating system updates to seven years starting with its flagship S24 device launched earlier this year.\n\nApple doesn't spell out how long it will support iOS updates for devices, although older devices like the iPhone 6s released in 2014 and the iPhone 8 were still getting security updates this year.\n\n___\n\nIs there a tech challenge you need help figuring out?

        "title": "Prediction: This Under-the-Radar Tech Stock Will Outperform Nvidia and Apple by 2030",
        "content": "Tech giants Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are on top of the world nowadays. They are the two most valuable stocks on the market, looking back at market-beating returns in the past five years. Apple's total returns delivered a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that period. Nvidia soared even higher with a 100% five-year CAGR. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been mighty kind to Nvidia's investors.\n\nThey achieved these massive gains in a strong era for the general market, but the S&P 500 index looks downright sleepy by comparison: AAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt would be cool if Nvidia and Apple were poised to continue their market-beating ways from here. Invest in the biggest, baddest names on the market, sit back and relax, and let them deliver more of the same good stuff for years to come. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that both stocks are a bit overvalued at today's massive market caps -- $3.1 trillion for Nvidia and $3.4 trillion for Apple. I know it's like comparing mountains of cash to rivers of revenues, but these two market caps add up to about 23% of America's gross domestic product.\n\nI think that's too much. Apple and Nvidia may be overdue for a painful correction. At best, I don't expect them to rise much higher in the foreseeable future.\n\nAt the same time, good old International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is gaining ground in the AI space, and its stock is undervalued today. I don't expect IBM's stock to pass the trillion-dollar mark in the next five years, but it should most certainly rise as Big Blue's enterprise-class AI tools add value to the stock. Most investors don't see this traditional computing giant as a promising AI investment yet. That's a big mistake.\n\nDon't forget IBM's cash-profit chops\n\nIBM's valuation ratios don't look terribly exciting at first glance. The stock is changing hands at 22 times trailing earnings and 2.9 times sales. Those are perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road values for mature companies, just below the averages seen in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average market indices.\n\nThen your eye slides over to IBM's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio, and the stock suddenly looks different. When you calculate IBM's values based on its massive cash profit, the stock seems to belong in Wall Street's bargain bin instead. This ratio stops at 14 times free cash flows, just over half of the S&P 500's or Dow Jones' readings.\n\nCash is king, and IBM has plenty of it. The company's rich cash profits and relatively modest bottom-line earnings show that Big Blue's accountants are very good at lowering taxable profits while putting lots of real greenbacks in the bank. I see cash flow as a higher-quality measure of profitability, so it's easy to look away from IBM's moderate price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nIBM's place in the AI boom\n\nRemember the five-year chart I showed you? IBM's chart for the same period is a different animal: IBM Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe stock has underperformed broad market indices for many years as it transformed a hardware-heavy business model into a more profitable software and services plan. In particular, you should know that the revamped Big Blue comes with a heavy focus on cloud computing, data security, and AI tools.\n\nYes, this company was a leading AI researcher long before ChatGPT's release opened the floodgates for AI investments. Many investors seem to have missed that connection since IBM's business results didn't immediately skyrocket in this soaring AI era. The big AI contracts are coming, just a bit late.\n\nYou see, IBM is happy to leave consumer-friendly ideas such as ChatGPT-style chatbots to other tech providers. This company will always go after large corporate contracts instead, adding extra layers of security, business-friendly data analytics, and lawsuit-repellant data tracking to the mix. Potential clients may take several quarters to test and approve the resulting AI recipe, but the end result is a lucrative long-term deal that won't be easy to replace.\n\nThe approvals are rolling in now, building a robust revenue stream for the long run. Market makers are still not paying attention, so IBM's stock keeps trading at incredibly low cash flow ratios. I can't wait to see what happens in a couple of years, when the AI contracts have become generous and highly profitable revenue streams.\n\nOne more thing...\n\nI'll admit that Nvidia and Apple are making solid cash profits, too. However, their sky-high stock prices already account for these high-quality profits. Apple's P/FCF ratio stands at 33 today, and Nvidia's is soaring at 79 times free cash flows.\n\nThanks, but no thanks. I'd much rather buy IBM's undervalued stock instead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Apple Siri the Best AI Assistant in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Siri stands against the other AI assistants.\n\nAs we have mentioned in our article, “10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1,\" the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.\n\nRegionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.\n\nWith the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that \"AI is not a passing fad.\" In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.\n\nIf 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.\n\nAnother study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, \"Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution,\" examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to \"augment\" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Siri\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 11\n\nAI-powered Siri is a virtual assistant included in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s watchOS, tvOS, and iOS operating systems. It makes recommendations, executes commands, and responds to questions by using voice recognition to assign requests to online services. Siri is well known for its strong safety and easy-to-use interface.\n\nApple is planning to replace Siri with AI to manage different application features. The concept is to use voice to control functionality within specific apps.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Google revamps controversial AI image generation tool after backlash",
        "content": "After Google pulled the ability for its AI chatbot to generate images of people, the search giant is reintroducing the feature following a high profile backlash.\n\nGoogle on Wednesday said that it will start to roll out an updated image generation tool for users of the English-language version its AI chatbot, Gemini Advanced. The service will also feature Google's latest image generation model, Imagen 3.\n\nIn February, Google disabled the ability of users to generate images of humans after the company acknowledged that its tool would \"overcompensate\" in seeking to depict diverse ranges of people, even in unrealistic or absurd scenarios. The episode highlighted the company's scramble to get it on the AI frenzy, and the risks of releasing new technology without rigorous vetting.\n\nA social media firestorm drew attention to images that, for example, depicted a Black woman as a US founding father and showed Black and Asian people as Nazi-era German soldiers.\n\nSome users wielded the results as evidence of an anti-white bias in what the tool generated.\n\nThe viral images sparked criticism from prominent figures, including X owner Elon Musk, who has previously criticized the perceived liberal bias of AI tools. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff at the time that some of the faulty responses were unacceptable, and that \"we got it wrong.\"\n\n\"With Imagen 3, we’ve made significant progress in providing a better user experience when generating images of people,\" said Dave Citron, a senior director at Google, in a blog post on Wednesday.\n\nThe reintroduction is the latest development in Google's AI rollouts, which have been uneven at times.\n\nLast year, Google fumbled the release of its initial AI chatbot Bard, when it spit out inaccurate responses during a promotional video.\n\nTaken together, the episodes underscored the perceived sloppiness of the launches and undermined Google's credibility, just as tech giants were jostling for position amid the AI hype. Google said it has upgraded its creative image generation capabilities and will bring its latest image generation model, Imagen 3 to Gemini Apps (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn an effort to prevent abuse, the tool won't support the generation of photorealistic scenes of identifiable individuals, minors or excessive violence, Citron said.\n\n\"Of course, as with any generative AI tool, not every image Gemini creates will be perfect, but we’ll continue to listen to feedback from early users as we keep improving. We'll gradually roll this out, aiming to bring it to more users and languages soon.\"\n\nGoogle's re-release comes at a fraught moment in the AI world.\n\nIn the months since the search giant originally released and pulled the tool, investors have wavered in their support of AI investments. Recent market volatility has resurfaced questions about the valuations of tech companies which have thrown enormous resources behind ambitious AI buildouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe competitive landscape has also changed.\n\nWhile Google was previously seen as playing catchup to Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has since joined the Big Tech AI party. And while the iPhone maker's rivals were dealing with boardroom drama and public backlash over AI developments, Wall Street has applauded Apple's efforts, highlighting the company's success at marketing AI tools in ways that other tech giants have struggled through.\n\nGoogle's reintroduction of the image generation feature also came just ahead of a pivotal earnings release from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of the AI chip designer are up about 160% so far this year. And AI bulls view a potential blowout report as the next catalyst in what has been a challenging market for chips and AI companies.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Is Apple Stock \"Under-owned\"? ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "Apple AAPL stock has gained 22.4% so far this year (as of Monday) and 26.1% in the past year. The company has been a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, but has picked up momentum of late.\n\nDaniel Loeb-backed Third Point hedge fund bet big on the stock, according to Street.com, on its latest AI initiative. Third Point started to buy Apple shares in April, and the stock was one of its portfolio's top five winners for the second quarter.\n\nLoeb also said that Apple’s stock had become increasingly 'under-owned' by institutional investors, and its relative multiple had squeezed toward a multi-year low, despite Apple stock’s recent run.  In its second-quarter earnings report, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge reduction in its stake in Apple, citing high valuations, as quoted on Economic Times.\n\nShould You Play Apple Stock With ETFs?\n\nSince there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple’s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the exchange-traded-fund (ETF) approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW. Let’s delve a little deeper into the stock’s potential.\n\nApple's AI Initiative\n\nLoeb has previewed Apple’s new artificial intelligence feature, \"Apple Intelligence,\" as a gamechanger. The AI feature is set to launch in October with iOS 18. This feature looks to enhance Siri (Apple’s original smartphone voice assistant), automate tasks like email generation and image sorting, and integrate advanced functions such as automated photo cleanup and ChatGPT. Loeb expects AI-driven growth to bolster revenues and earnings of Apple.\n\nApple’s Privacy-Focused Cloud Services\n\nApple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities that determine whether a request can be processed on device or needs cloud access. Apple has assured that no user information will be stored in the cloud.\n\nRecent Financial Performance of Apple\n\nApple reported robust third-quarter earnings, surpassing earnings per share and revenue estimates. While iPhone sales remain important, the iPad segment saw strong growth, indicating market expansion opportunities. However, challenges in Greater China impacted regional sales.\n\nBroker Rating for AAPL Stock\n\nStory continues\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the basis of actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.62 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.\n\nOf the 31 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 61.29% and 9.68% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 66.67%, while Buy represented 10%.\n\nPrice Target for AAPL Shares\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 31 analysts, the average price target for Apple stock comes to $241.68. The forecasts range from a low of $184.00 to a high of $300.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.38% from the closing price of $227.18 recorded on Monday.\n\nAny Wall of Worry for Apple?\n\nApple’s competitors have faced several AI hiccups before. Google’s Bard provided incorrect answers, and its Gemini image generator displayed inaccurate images. Microsoft’s Copilot+PC standard raised security concerns, while Meta faced criticism for not allowing users to disable its AI chatbot. Apple has always thrived on its reputation for security. Hence, any flaws in its generative AI efforts could harm its brand.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first non-technology company in the U.S. to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate's stock has surged over 30% in 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This impressive feat comes just days before Buffett, often referred to as the 'Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha,' celebrates his 94th birthday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Berkshire's shares climbed to an all-time high, pushing the company's market value past the $1 trillion mark.\n\nUnlike the other members of the trillion-dollar club—Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta—Berkshire Hathaway is distinguished by its focus on traditional industries.\n\nThe company owns a diverse array of businesses. However, Berkshire's significant investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also been a significant contributor to its recent growth.\n\nBuffett took control of Berkshire in the 1960s and has since transformed it into a vast empire with interests in insurance, railroads, retail, and energy. The company is renowned for its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves.\n\nRecently, Buffett has adopted a more cautious approach, selling off a large amount of stock—including half of Berkshire's Apple holdings—and amassing a record $277 billion in cash by the end of June.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was revealed that over the past few days, Berkshire has sold more shares of Bank of America as the company continues to trim its stake in the U.S. lender.\n\nAccording to regulatory filings, Berkshire has sold around $5.4 billion worth of Bank of America shares sales since mid-July. According to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, between August 23 and 27, the company is said to have sold roughly 24.7 million shares of the lender.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire joins the $1 trillion club\n\nPoland stocks lower at close of trade; WIG30 down 0.58%\n\nUS SEC requires monthly reports on investment fund holdings\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe AI-led rally in the stock market is expected to ripple through other sectors and smaller tech companies, but analysts believe for now large-cap companies are still the key focus of money managers. Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is “too narrow.”\n\n“Historically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a “higher-for-longer” rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,” the firm said.\n\nThe latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.  Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT? that they remain more optimistic about AI’s economic potential even if we don’t see immediate benefits for now.\n\nHedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That’s why it’s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Are Hedge Funds Buying and Selling Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Stock?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q2: 184\n\nTotal Number of Hedge Fund Investors as of the End of Q1: 150\n\nPerhaps the biggest news around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) related to the latest 13F filings from hedge funds was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire cutting its stake in the company by 50%. Who else is jumping the Apple ship? Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office cut its stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to 24,000 shares during Q2 from about 115,000 shares. Billionaire Ray Dalio’s fund reduced its position in the company to 469K shares from 1.84 million shares. Billionaire DE Shaw’s fund cut its Apple stake by 33%. Billionaire Israel Englander, on the other hand, increased his stake in the company by 68% via Millennium Management.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.\n\n“We believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’ suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,  iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.”\n\nLoeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they’d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nThird Point Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nIn April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.\n\nDespite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Hedge Funds are Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It expects global smartphone shipments to climb by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, recuperating from two challenging years.\n\nThe research firm flagged the popularity of budget Android smartphones in China and emerging markets and the luxury markets’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence smartphones as potential catalysts.\n\nIDC expects Android to grow nine times faster at 7.1% than Apple iOS due to higher competition in China.\n\nHowever, IDC highlighted GenAI’s success with the upcoming iPhone 16 and Apple’s capability to forge local AI partnerships in China as potential growth drivers for Apple.\n\nIDC expects the iOS trajectory to improve in 2025 with 4% year-over-year growth courtesy of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIDC expects GenAI smartphones to win an 18% market share by 2024, driven by the premiumization trend.\n\nIn 2023, Apple ramped up its China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites and launched a new Apple store in Shanghai, reflecting its keenness in the market.\n\nCEO Tim Cook attended the China Development Forum in Beijing.

Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it’s going to be a “difficult week” for major tech companies.\n\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\n“I still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,” Munster said.\n\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\n“There is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it’s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.”\n\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc.

These companies were instrumental in driving the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains last year, with a Morgan Stanley report highlighting that these seven companies alone accounted for half of the index's total return.\n\nThe combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven exceeds that of the entire stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China, and Canada combined. However, this group has recently encountered significant setbacks. Six of the seven companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, and the results have fallen short of the lofty expectations set by investors.\n\nTesla, for instance, saw its earnings plummet by more than 40%, despite surpassing sales forecasts. Amazon’s share price plunged 11% following its earnings announcement. Growing concerns about the health of the US economy also fuelled a wave of selling across global markets.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\n\"Coming into this earnings season, the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were up against almost impossible expectations of beating perfection,\" Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBiz Investment Advisory Services, said. \"So in some ways, it's not surprising to see some sell-off here.\"\n\nThere are also cases where the Mag 7 are just too expensive. Nvidia's valuation surged to such heights that it became out of reach for many value investors. Back in July the company decided to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split, when it was trading at around $1,210, to make its stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. It is now trading at around $120 as the countdown continues to its earnings.\n\nThe $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks when it reports later on Wednesday, serving as a bellwether for AI spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.\n\nAs the AI rally enters a crucial stage, investors are left to consider where to look for alternatives to diversify their portfolio or undervalued stocks that might benefit from artificial intelligence. Here are some companies to have on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nFive alternatives to the Magnificent Seven ASML makes lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nASML (ASML)\n\nThe AI rally has been driven by the need for the world’s most advanced chips. Dutch company ASML manufactures lithography machines essential for producing them.\n\nWhile not a household name, ASML should be on any investor’s radar who is looking to capitalise on the growth of artificial intelligence.\n\nASML is virtually the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. Its clients include semiconductor giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (005930.KS).\n\nWhen ASML published its quarterly results in July, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “ASML is further proof that the AI boom still has legs. Demand is soaring for the semiconductor equipment maker.”\n\nDespite a recent share price pullback, the current price of around $920 is more than 20% below analysts' consensus target of $1,194, and the vast majority of analysts still consider the stock a strong buy.\n\n“Companies across countless industries are investing heavily in AI, which means chipmakers have the confidence to build more manufacturing plants,” Coatsworth added. “That feeds into greater demand for ASML’s equipment, which plays a crucial role in the production of computer chips.”\n\nHowever, weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance has negatively impacted the stock. Nearly half of ASML’s sales still come from China, making geopolitical risk a significant concern for investors.\n\nRead more: How likely are multiple Bank of England interest rate cuts this year?\n\nASML is also part of the \"Granolas\" — a group of \"internationally-exposed quality growth compounders\" and Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven, according to Goldman Sachs. So named for the combined first initials, which spell Grannnllass, the eleven companies are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche (ROG.SW), ASML, Nestle (NESN.SW), Novartis (NOVN.SW), Novo Nordisk (NVO), L'Oreal (OR.PA), LVMH (MC.PA), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), SAP (SAP) and Sanofi (SNY).\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) The weight loss drug has proven to be a success with celebrities. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nNovo Nordisk, another member of the Granolas, is currently Europe’s largest company by market capitalisation and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, is not exposed to the tech sector. This could be an attractive option for those who believe that AI is a bubble or simply want diversification.\n\nThe Danish firm makes the weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, which have gained widespread popularity, including among celebrities such as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and TV personality Oprah Winfrey.\n\nSam North, market analyst at eToro, told Yahoo Finance UK: \"Novo Nordisk emerges as a standout option in Europe. The Danish pharmaceutical giant has gone from strength to strength over the last few years and is currently the largest stock in Europe by market capitalisation.\n\n“Analysts are optimistic about Novo Nordisk's performance, particularly with its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. The company reportedly sold 10.4bn Danish kroner (£1.2bn) worth of Wegovy in the first quarter alone, more than doubling its sales from the same period last year.\"\n\nHe added: “From a technical analysis standpoint, there are a couple of levels that I think act as a good guide of sentiment for the bulls to focus on. The 740 DKK level offers a potential entry point for those looking to buy on dips, while a move above 928 DKK could signal a push towards its previous all-time high. In an environment where timing the market is challenging, Novo Nordisk stands out as a resilient and promising addition to any portfolio.”\n\nNovo Nordisk’s shares have surged around 260% since launching Wegovy in the United States in June 2021. The company’s market value of £455bn now exceeds the size of the entire Danish economy.\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) The group that owns the Louis Vuitton brand has show resilience in the consumer discretionary segment.. (Pablo Cuadra via Getty Images)\n\nThough LVMH has lost its crown as Europe’s largest company to Novo Nordisk, it remains a heavyweight contender.\n\nDespite challenges in the consumer discretionary sector, LVMH has continued to deliver strong profits, with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels. This translated into €10.7bn (£9.02bn/$12bn) in operating profit. Additionally, its free cash flow increased by 74% to €3.13bn, or 7.5% of revenue.\n\nThe stock has pulled back on slowing growth and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22:2.\n\nLVMH's diversified conglomerate model, which includes brands like Tiffany, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora, allows it to tap into different luxury segments.\n\nGrowth is also likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall globally.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)  Snowflake chairman and CEO Frank Slootman gifts a snowboard to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nReturning to the US and the tech sector, Snowflake is well-positioned to benefit from the AI rally. Snowflake’s CEO Frank Slootman said: “There is no AI strategy without a data strategy.”\n\nThe company focuses on data management services, collecting and analysing an organisation’s data to deliver insights that help businesses grow. The rise of AI has made this data even more valuable.\n\nThe demand for Snowflake’s data management platform has driven strong revenue growth. In its 2024 fiscal year, Snowflake achieved $2.8bn in sales, up 36% from the prior year’s $2.1bn. The company expects its revenue to continue expanding, estimating $3.3bn in sales for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, analysts remain cautious, which could mean the share is currently undervalued.\n\n“Waning optimisation headwinds and emerging new product initiatives should support growth, but investors may need more concrete signals to get on board,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a report.\n\nSeven analysts have a \"strong buy\" recommendation for Snowflake’s shares, and 24 rate it as a \"buy\", according to Yahoo Finance data. The market consensus sees the share price trading at $166, higher than the current $118, with $220 as the high range for the stock.\n\nRolls Royce (RR.L) Rolls Royce has surprised investors under new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIt is not part of the Magnificent Seven, it does not list under Europe’s Granola’s and it is part of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which Nvidia alone has overtaken in value. So how can Rolls Royce be a Mag 7 alternative?\n\nThe company has delivered a total shareholder return of 221% over the past year, matching Nvidia's performance. This surprise achievement reflects growing investor confidence in the turnaround plan laid out by new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic.\n\nHis vision for Rolls-Royce is ambitious, aiming to transform the company into a leaner, more profitable enterprise with a bright future. Erginbilgic’s has set out to achieve a dramatic increase in adjusted operating profits from about £250m to between £2.5bn and £2.8bn by 2027.\n\nThis growth is underpinned by a strategy to unlock £2bn in working capital savings, primarily through better inventory management. These efficiencies are expected to help the company boost free cash flow from £500m to between £2.8bn and £3.1bn over the next five years.\n\nSince Erginbilgic joined, shares have more than quadrupled to top London’s premier index. That rally is made all the more remarkable given the struggles that gripped Rolls-Royce in the years prior, which included a very close brush with bankruptcy during the pandemic.\n\nThe biggest turnaround is expected to happen at the civil aviation business, which accounts for nearly half of group sales. The rest of its revenues are split relative evenly between Rolls-Royce’s defence and power systems divisions.\n\nErginbilgic believes civil aviation’s adjusted operating margins can be lifted from 2.5% to between 14.5% and 16.5% by 2027. While the improvement looks dramatic, these levels of profitability are comparable to those of some rivals.\n\nThe current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Rolls-Royce stands at 18. While some investors may argue that this valuation isn't cheap, it's also not particularly expensive for a blue-chip company within the FTSE 100.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has More Money Invested in This Than He Does Apple, AmEx, Bank of America, Coke, Chevron, and Oxy Combined",
        "content": "What's Warren Buffett's biggest position in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio? If I were asked that question, my automatic response would be Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). But I'd be wrong.\n\nYes, Apple remains Buffett's biggest stock holding. However, it's not his biggest position. Buffett has more money invested in one asset than he does in Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleumcombined. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's biggest holding by far\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has big bucks invested in its five largest stock holdings. Its stake in Apple is worth $90.7 billion even after Buffett nearly halved the conglomerate's position in the iPhone maker. Berkshire's stake in AmEx totals close to $38.5 billion. Bank of America is a close third, with Berkshire's position weighing in at roughly $37 billion.\n\nThe next largest position in Berkshire's portfolio is Coca-Cola, with Buffett's 400 million shares worth around $28.3 billion. Two oil stocks round out the top six, Chevron and Occidental, with Berkshire's stakes totaling nearly $17.6 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively.\n\nIn aggregate, Berkshire's positions in these six stocks are currently valued at nearly $227 billion. That's a lot of money, but it isn't as much as Buffett has invested in another asset.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills totaled $238.7 billion. This amount includes $4.1 billion of the conglomerate's $42.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less.\n\nWhy does Buffett have so much money in U.S. Treasuries?\n\nBerkshire has a standing policy to keep at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries. However, that threshold is much lower than the current level, which is the highest ever for the conglomerate. Why does Buffett have so much money invested in U.S. Treasuries right now?\n\nBuffett answered this question in his 2021 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. At the time, Berkshire's balance sheet included $120 billion of U.S. Treasuries plus another $24 billion in cash. He wrote then that the large amount was \"a consequence of my failure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.\"\n\nThat begs the question: What are Buffett's criteria for buying businesses and stocks? He has answered this one in the past, too. In the legendary investor's 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would only invest in businesses and stocks that:\n\nStory continues\n\nHe could \"sensibly estimate\" an earnings range for at least five years in the future. Have a price that was reasonable compared to the lower boundary of the estimated earnings range. Are in his \"circle of competence.\"\n\nThere are undoubtedly lots of stocks for which Buffett can determine sensible future earnings estimates. Plenty of stocks are in his \"circle of competence\" as well. I think Berkshire's huge position in Treasuries is primarily due to stock valuations being too high for him to want to buy -- with a few exceptions, of course.\n\nShould you buy Treasuries, too?\n\nYour investing goals are almost certainly different from Buffett's. But while I doubt most investors will want their largest position to be in U.S. Treasuries, having some of your portfolio in the asset could be wise. Treasuries are a great place to park your cash over the short term while you wait for a potential opportunity to buy stocks at more attractive prices.\n\nI think, though, that some areas of the market offer attractive valuations already. In particular, many small-cap stocks are bargains after lagging well behind large-cap stocks in recent years. With the likelihood that interest rate cuts are on the way, they could perform well going forward.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. took the rare step of cutting about 100 jobs in its digital services group, part of a shift in priorities for the critical division, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNazi Bunker’s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher Chicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun How the Cortiços of São Paulo Helped Shelter South America’s Largest City\n\nThe company informed the affected employees, who worked across several different teams in Senior Vice President Eddy Cue’s services group, on Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public.\n\nThe layoffs included some engineering roles, and the biggest cuts were made to the team responsible for the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore. There were also layoffs in other services teams, including the one that runs Apple News.\n\nApple Books has become less of a priority for the company, which doesn’t see it as a major part of its services lineup. The Books app is still expected to get new features over time, according to the people. As for Apple News, the layoffs aren’t a sign that it’s becoming less of a focus, they said.\n\nLayoffs are relatively rare at Apple, though the company has made at least four rounds of reductions in 2024. Earlier this year, it laid off hundreds of workers when it shuttered its self-driving car project as well as an effort to make microLED displays. It also closed down a team in San Diego.\n\nA representative for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the cutbacks.\n\nServices have generally been a growth engine for Apple in recent years. They accounted for more than 22% of sales in the most recent fiscal year, up from less than 10% a decade ago, and the rise has helped cushion at-times sluggish demand for devices.\n\nMany of the cuts happened in the applications organization that is run by longtime Vice President Roger Rosner. Employees were told they’d have 60 days to find another job within Apple before being terminated. Some of the employees worked across multiple teams, so other areas were tangentially affected as well.\n\nSome of Apple’s Silicon Valley peers are shedding jobs in far greater numbers as they cope with slowing growth and a shift to artificial intelligence. Cisco Systems Inc. is slashing its headcount by about 7%, while Intel Corp. is eliminating more than 15%.\n\n(Updates with more on layoffs in eighth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFar-Right ‘Terrorgram’ Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks Hong Kong’s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City’s Property Pain Losing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

The latest tranche of funding, a $1.4 billion pool, is now open for developer applications.\n\nAmazon also launched the Amazon Housing Equity Accelerator, a free, 18-month program to help grow the careers of diverse real estate developers. Amazon has invested $25 million to support the program and graduated 38 developers so far. \"We know housing is a really big challenge for a lot of people, especially in and around expensive metro areas, and we feel strongly that we can help give back to our communities by helping preserve and create thousands of affordable homes,\" said CEO Andy Jassy.\n\nApple And The Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund\n\nApple is the major donor behind the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, an initiative to make loans for affordable housing projects. The first $50 million investment will fund four projects that will create over 400 homes within the next two years. The first project is Mercy Housing, an affordable development in San Francisco's Mission District offering 145 units of permanent supportive housing for seniors. Another project is planned for Santa Cruz. Apple committed $2.5 billion for affordable housing in California in 2019 and has already deployed $1.6 billion. Developers working with Apple are building or preserving more than 10,000 units statewide. Working with partners that include Housing Trust Silicon Valley, California Housing Finance Agency, and the United Way of Greater Los Angeles, Apple has helped California residents stay housed and finance home purchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's Housing Efforts\n\nIn 2019, Alphabet announced a $1 billion housing initiative. That total included $750 million in land that the company already owned and planned to repurpose. Like Apple, Alphabet, through Google, has worked with Housing Trust Silicon Valley and invested $50 million in the Housing Trust's TECH Fund in 2020. Much of Google's efforts have centered on the San Jose area. The company is currently pursuing the idea of a mixed-use community in the Downtown West area that would have a designated affordable housing development in a former retail location. Google has been at work on this project for a while. Plans got put on pause in 2023, but appear to be back on track.\n\nCheck It Out:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. Get ‘em while you can — investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\n\nThese aren't the only initiatives from large tech companies. Microsoft committed $750 million back in 2019 and as of 2022, it had deployed $583 million to create and preserve around 9,200 units of housing in the Puget Sound area. In 2019, back when Meta was still Facebook, it announced a $1 billion affordable housing initiative that included $225 million in land donations in Menlo Park, CA, where the company is headquartered. Housing affordability is also part of the efforts of the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, the foundation created by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. In April, the nonprofit opened applications for funds that finance multiple rental and owner-occupied housing projects benefiting low and moderate-income households.\n\nLike many issues in our modern society, a mixture of private and public capital may be necessary to bring about substantive change. While the amount of money that large technology companies are allocating to housing is substantial, with as many as four to seven million units of affordable housing needed, there is still a long way to go.\n\nYou Can Profit From Real Estate Without Owning Property\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields and you don't have to own property to do it...\n\nThe Arrived Homes investment platform has created a Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Morgan Stanley’s Highest Conviction Stocks",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's Highest Conviction Stocks: Top 20 Stocks To Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Morgan Stanley's other high conviction stocks.\n\nWith the second half of 2024 having settled in, the broader economic environment that will determine the future course of the stock market is becoming clearer. While the surge in investor interest surrounding artificial intelligence stocks placed the macroeconomic picture in the background for a while, now, as the second quarter earnings season is nearly over, macroeconomics is coming back into play. Investors are eager to read the mind of Fed chairman Jerome Powell for future interest rate cut decisions and the crystal ball to see what way the economy is heading.\n\nOn this front, investment bank Morgan Stanley has been churning out quite a lot of reports to guide investors. One such report came out in July and shared the bank's key themes to focus on during the month. While July is over, this report contains key details that can provide information about what to expect for the rest of the year too. Two of the biggest takeaways from this report cover an economic soft landing and the potential for equities performance to widen.\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\n\nOn the former front, the bank shared that July \"bolstered the case for a soft landing as inflation has declined and a few major central banks cut rates.\" It believes that forward looking data suggests that \"wage growth should continue to slow in the U.S. and Eurozone\" which will eventually contribute to cooling inflation and eventually lower rates to increase the chances of a soft landing. In terms of data, the bank's estimates for 2025 suggest that year over year wage growth could sit at 3% in 2025 for a marked growth over the 2022 peak.\n\nBack then, wage growth percentages as indicated by Indeed postings and the Fed had stood at ~9.4% and ~6.5%, respectively. As an additional positive note, the bank also adds that the US is leading the EU and the UK because of its wage growth of 3% which is less than half of the UK's roughly 7%.\n\nOn the latter front, i.e., MS' belief that equities performance can widen, it shares that there \"is ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.\" What this means is that big tech has accounted for most of the market's returns this year due to the AI hype, and this can spread out to smaller firms but only if the broader economy recovers. Underlying this belief is data for the flagship S&P index's price to earnings ratio, as the bank shares that the 12 month forward P/E \"runs at 21x on a cap-weighted basis but only 16x equal- weighted.\" This suggests that the smaller companies have room to catch up with the larger companies, but their performance will only improve if consumer and business spending flourishes during a cyclical uptrend.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis potential has led the bank to lament that \"we turned neutral too soon\" as it also cites forward earnings data to support the hypothesis of the bifurcation in valuation. For the Magnificent Seven stocks, the 12 month forward earnings rebased to 100 as of December 2023 sit at a whopping 120 while the estimate for the remaining 493 firms on the S&P index is ~106. However, before you get too optimistic, MS also cautions against investing in small cap stocks. It shares that small cap \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates, which seems unlikely in the current inflation environment.\" Plotting the returns of small caps with bond yields to signify a relationship with interest rates, its data shows that when bond yields were at 1%, small cap relative returns to large caps were 100%. But when the yields soared to ~5.6%, these returns dropped to ~82%.\n\nMS' August report builds on the July themes. It builds on the bearishness surrounding small caps, shifts the focus on the labor market over inflation, and brings real estate into the mix. Reducing wage growth allows the Fed to shift its focus from inflation \"to potential cracks in the labor market,\" says the bank, but it cautions that recession \"indicators such as the Sahm Rule are creeping toward a recessionary threshold based on the rising national unemployment rate.\" Its data shows that the 3 month national unemployment average is 0.5% over the previous 12 month low, which rings a warning bell, to say the least. Still bearish on small caps, it adds that while \"recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.\"\n\nThere is some positivity in the August report, though. The bank shares that commercial real estate, which has been one of the hardest hit sectors from rising rates and shifting trends to remote working, now presents an \"emerging opportunity set.\" The analysts outline that commercial real estate valuations \"valuations have become more attractive in the face of higher interest rates and elevated supply,\" adding that they \"expect volumes to pick up this year due to upcoming debt maturities, reinforcing these lower entry points.\" Counterintuitively, this optimism is based on depressed valuations as it uses the commercial real estate cap rate. As per MS' data, this rate sat at 9% in March 2024, for nearly a two percentage point lead over retail real estate and a wider three point lead over residential real estate. The bank is also quite impressed with hedge fund performance in 2024 as it commented that the funds \"delivered attractive risk-adjusted performance in the first half of 2024 and their positioning suggests confidence in the opportunities for skill-based returns.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks, we used its latest 20 top conviction stock ideas and ranked them by the average percentage share price upside to the bank's own share price targets.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nShare Price Upside: 21%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. Its $3.4 trillion valuation is driven by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s bread and butter product, the iPhone, its tight ecosystem that drives complementary and other product sales, and technological and design strengths that focus on aesthetics as well as hardcore engineering such as semiconductor design. For the nine months ending in June, $155 billion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $296 billion in revenue was from iPhone sales. This makes the iPhone upgrade cycle a key tenet of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, as analysts and investors place their faith in strong product design and ecosystem capture making iPhone users stick with the lineup when they choose to upgrade. Another key pillar of the hypothesis is the Services business division which accounted for $72 billion of revenue during the nine month period. Apart from products such as the App Store, Services also include revenue from payments made by Google to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to offer Google's Search on its products, and anti trust action against Google or other legal actions could spell trouble.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\"Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of Morgan Stanley's highest conviction stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Research firm IDC raised its forecast for full-year global smartphone shipments on Tuesday, citing strong growth in the first half of the year as consumer electronics demand recovers and artificial intelligence features attract buyers.\n\nIDC expects shipments to grow 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, up from its previous forecast of 4% growth to 1.21 billion units.\n\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\n\nIn an uncertain economy where price-conscious consumers typically hesitate to make big purchases, the forecast raise suggests that the new AI features might boost demand in key markets like the U.S. and China, which is recovering after a prolonged slump.\n\nKEY QUOTE\n\n\"Although GenAI smartphones are relatively new in the market, premium flagships will continue to adopt GenAI features to help separate them from the pack,\" said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nApple is set to hold its fall event on Sept. 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where it is expected to unveil new iPhones, as it looks to reverse a global sales slowdown, particularly in China.\n\nAt its developers conference in June, Apple unveiled a series of AI features for its operating system under the name \"Apple Intelligence\".\n\nEarlier this month, Alphabet's Google also announced its new line of Pixel smartphones with deep AI integration.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nIDC predicts GenAI smartphones will surge 344%, capturing 18% of the market by the end of 2024 as more flagships adopt built-in generative AI features for daily use.\n\nThe firm projects Apple's iOS growth trajectory to improve in 2025 with 4% year-over-year growth, thanks to Apple Intelligence.\n\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\n\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The buzz surrounding Apple on Wall Street these days is not related to artificial intelligence, but rather the sale of Apple stock by Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. Even as the firm prepares to debut new M4 processors and Apple Intelligence, hardware and software specifically designed for AI tasks, the Buffett sale has overshadowed the upcoming annual Apple event. Buffett reduced his stake in the firm by half during the second quarter of 2024, latest 13F filings reveal. The timing of this move seems questionable, since Apple continues to show strong iPhone shipments and has the most AI-enabled PC portfolio in the global market.\n\nWhen it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even Wall Street analysts seem to be at odds with Buffett. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%. In a recent investor note, data cited by Loop Capital supply chain analyst John Donovan suggested that iPhone shipments for the September quarter were above market expectations.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "In the grand tale of Silicon Valley, Apple Inc. often recalls the dynamic duo of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. But there's a lesser-known character in this story, a man who played a crucial role in Apple's early days yet slipped into the background of history: Ronald Wayne.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\n\nWayne was the third co-founder of Apple, a man whose brief stint with the company became a legendary tale of what might have been. He famously sold his 10% stake in the company for just $800 – a decision that, in hindsight, seems almost unimaginable. Today, thanks to Apple's current market value of approximately $3.45 trillion, Wayne’s stake would be worth around $345 billion.\n\nTrending: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nRonald Wayne, born in 1934, was already an experienced engineer and entrepreneur when he joined forces with the much younger Jobs and Wozniak in 1976. At 41, Wayne brought maturity and stability to the team, otherwise brimming with youthful energy and ambition. His job was to provide \"adult supervision\" to the startup, manage the mechanical engineering, and handle the necessary paperwork. Wayne was instrumental in drafting the original partnership agreement and even designed Apple's first logo. Despite his significant contributions, Wayne's time with Apple was incredibly short – just 12 days.\n\nSo, why did he walk away? Wayne was concerned about the financial risks involved. Jobs had taken out a $15,000 loan to fill an order for The Byte Shop, a retailer with a shaky reputation. As the only one with substantial personal assets (including a house), Wayne feared that the debt would fall on him if the business failed. Jobs and Wozniak, having no real assets then, had little to lose, but Wayne wasn't in the same position. The fear of financial ruin led him to sell his shares to Jobs and Wozniak for that fateful $800.\n\nTrending: Groundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $100\n\nLooking back, it's easy to see Wayne's decision as a monumental mistake, especially given Apple's incredible success. But Wayne himself has no regrets. He's often said that had he stayed with Apple, the stress would have likely killed him, making him the \"richest man in the graveyard.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRonald Wayne's story is a sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of entrepreneurship. While he missed out on becoming one of the richest men in the world, he's at peace with his decision, valuing his well-being over wealth. Today, there's growing recognition of his contributions, with many now acknowledging his role in the birth of Apple.\n\nHis legacy, ultimately, isn't defined by the wealth he gave up but by the fact that he was there, right at the beginning, laying the groundwork for one of the most influential companies in history.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

        "title": "Billionaire Daniel Loeb Added To These Three Stocks: Should You Join Him?",
        "content": "Billionaire Daniel Loeb Added To These Three Stocks: Should You Join Him?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nDaniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of Third Point, a large hedge fund, is known for his intelligent take on the overall stock market. He publishes his thoughts each quarter in an investor letter that can provide insights for all investors.\n\nLike many investors, Third Point has benefited from the run-up in tech stocks, and Loeb says that the company will continue to invest in those areas. However, Third Point also looks at the physical world. \"In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment,\" Loeb wrote.\n\nTrending Now:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThree Places Loeb And Third Point Are Investing Now\n\nWhile others, including Warren Buffett, are selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, Third Point has taken a position. Apple stock is up approximately 21% year to date. Loeb highlighted the power of Apple's device ecosystem. Some critics have said Apple has been too slow to move on artificial intelligence; Loeb sees things differently. He believes Apple Intelligence will increase iPhone sales, which have been lackluster in recent quarters, and turn Apple's app store into the \"primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps.\"\n\nThird Point added to its position in Corpay (NYSE:CPAY), a stock up over 8% year to date. Corpay is far from a household name, but it is a crucial player in the payments space. Corpay operates a fuel card business that processes fuel purchases by commercial vehicle operators. It also has a strong B2B business payments segment. While Loeb mentioned that the popularity of electric vehicles could have a longer-term impact on a company that facilitates gasoline and diesel payments, he said the company is prepared for the transition. The decline in EV sales may also indicate that the shift to electric vehicles will take much longer than initially anticipated. Loeb believes Corpay can shift so that B2B payments become the growth areas of the business. “We see this as a watershed moment for the stock, which will turn investor focus from the prior driver of Corpay's revenue growth to the next one and will reassure investors that Corpay has many years of 10%+ EPS growth ahead,” he wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More:\n\nFind out how you compare to the average American couple’s retirement balance — will you make the $1,000,000 mark? Get ‘em while you can — investing in this asset class may be reaching a high-water mark but you can still make returns right now.\n\nThe third company that Loeb highlighted is Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:U), a stock up nearly 27% year-to-date. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offers information services and exchange assets across various asset classes, including energy, mortgages, fixed income, rates, and equities. This is a very data-driven business. It currently generates 30% of its revenues from the oil, natural gas, and environmental futures markets. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement generates another 20% of revenue from its mortgage franchise, which has grown since the acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Black Knight. It has over a 50% market share in mortgage origination and mortgage servicing software. The potential is to build a complete platform that services the loan from origination to outcome. This consolidation is occurring as we near what is expected to be the bottom of the mortgage market. As interest rates drop, increasing mortgage applications could be good news for ICE’s mortgage business and stock.\n\nLike many others, Loeb believes a lower-rate environment will increase credit transactions and spur mergers and acquisitions. In addition to equities, Third Point invests in corporate and structured credit, and he sees an opportunity ahead: \"As rates rally and concerns of a recession reemerge, mounting credit issues in public, corporate credit and commercial real estate should present interesting opportunities for us to reinvest amidst the volatility.\"\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\nThis article Billionaire Daniel Loeb Added To These Three Stocks: Should You Join Him? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.2%. The $390.22 billion and $424.35 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.8% and +8.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "29% of Warren Buffett's Portfolio Is Invested in This 1 Monster AI Stock",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still on top of investors' minds. With the belief that this could be a game-changing technology, it makes sense why people want to gain exposure to this trend in their portfolios.\n\nThat's also true for the great Warren Buffett, who has historically shied away from making tech investments. Berkshire Hathaway, the massive conglomerate that he runs, has 29% of its public equities portfolio in one monster AI stock.\n\nContinue reading to find out what company this is and if it makes for a smart investment right now.\n\nApple's advantage\n\nOne of Warren Buffett's most successful investments is a recent one. I'm talking about his incredibly lucrative bet on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker's shares have skyrocketed over the past few years.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha decided to trim his position meaningfully in the three-month period that ended in June. Nonetheless, Apple is still the single-largest position in the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nNvidia gets all the attention, as it's the main poster child for the AI boom. But investors shouldn't forget about the already dominant tech titans that have long been at the forefront of digital trends. Apple is one of these businesses.\n\nIn typical fashion, the Cupertino-based company was late to the game in terms of revealing its AI strategy. But it certainly made a splash.\n\nCalled Apple Intelligence, the overarching objective is simply to make the company's various hardware devices more useful to consumers. Notable features are an upgraded Siri assistant, enhanced writing tools, and the ability to generate images. Newer products with the latest software will have these AI features enabled, which will be integrated with ChatGPT.\n\nInvestors might be looking for businesses that can introduce completely new AI-related products and services. But I think this is the wrong way to view things. Instead, companies that already lead their respective industries will likely utilize AI to bolster their current competitive positions.\n\nHere's where Apple has an advantage. It has over 2.2 billion active devices across the globe, which creates unmatched distribution capabilities to release its AI features with immediate adoption. Given that users are locked into the Apple ecosystem, I'm confident the business will be successful with this new initiative.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I still see one main goal with the company's AI push: to sell more iPhones. Apple remains a smartphone enterprise, as 46% of its third-quarter 2024 (ended June 29) revenue was derived from the sale of iPhones. Perhaps Apple Intelligence will encourage more people to switch to the latest models.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users, we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade,\" CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock?\n\nApple is one obvious way to bet on the AI trend. It's a competitively advantaged and extremely profitable enterprise. But to be clear, I don't think the stock is a smart buying opportunity today.\n\nAs of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34. That's a substantial premium to the trailing five- and 10-year averages. Paying such a steep price only makes sense if Apple's growth is set to accelerate in the years ahead. But given that this is a very mature business these days, that's not likely.\n\nThe average investor shouldn't blindly follow the actions of the greats, even Warren Buffett. The fact that the investing legend trimmed his position could be a clear sign that he doesn't believe Apple is as compelling of an opportunity anymore. I believe this is the right point of view to have, which means investors should reconsider buying the stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $792,725!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. TheStock Advisorservice has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of August 26, 2024\n\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Nvidia.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks.\n\nAn Analysis of the Technology Industry\n\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\n\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.\n\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:\n\n“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”\n\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\n\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) the maker of the famous iPhone is one the best technology stocks to buy for the long term. It was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.\n\nIt is one of the largest companies by market capitalization, which is more than $3.41 trillion as of August 23, 2024. The company has been growing its revenue by 8% and its net income by 10% during the past 10 years. The Q3 2024 of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was also a success story, its revenue grew 5% year-over-year to reach $85.8 billion, whereas, its earnings per share grew 11% during the same time.\n\nThe company also achieved record revenues from its Canada, Mexico, France, the UK, Germany, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand markets. Moreover, its service revenue also improved 14% year-over-year to reach an all-time high of $24.2 billion.\n\nAnalysts are expecting its earnings to grow by 17% during the year to reach $7, while the broader market average sits at 4%. 47 analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $250 presenting an upside of 11% from current levels.\n\nAnalysts are expecting that investments made in AAPL will pay off big time because of artificial intelligence. Yes, the company has been using AI for a long time as we have seen Siri as its virtual assistant, however, the company is about to scale up its AI game.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced plans to launch its Apple intelligence in the upcoming months. Its initial features include a new interface for Siri, the ability to rewrite content in different tones, summarize emails, and other AI accessibility features. Later, the company plans to integrate ChatGPT to further enhance its Apple intelligence for iPhone users.\n\nHere’s the catch: The launch of Apple intelligence will only work on iPhone 15 Pro and the upcoming models thereby leading to an iPhone upgrade supercycle for the company. For context, during the most recent quarter, iPhone sales accounted for around 46% of the net sales. Thus, as expected the upgrade supercycle has the potential to substantially increase the revenue of the company and subsequently boost returns for its investors.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American stocks.\n\nWith August Ending, What Can We Expect From US Markets?\n\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\n\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\n\nHow Would a Potential Rate Cut Impact The Markets?\n\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\n\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of those tech companies that needs no introduction, given its immense fame and contributions in the tech space. It is considered to be one of the best American investments because of its leading role in tech and its vast growth across the globe.\n\nInvestors are interested in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) not only because of its tech products but also because it has diversified its offerings to include attached services, such as the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. Through these services, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ensured that it has a recurring revenue stream providing a higher margin. Over 1 billion subscribers pay for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) attached services in 2024, which is almost double the amount of subscribers in 2020.\n\nConsidering the fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a distinct and market-leading brand and device ecosystem, investors believe that the company is well-positioned to benefit from the rise of AI. Another catalyst influencing this opinion and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth is Apple Intelligence, a newly unveiled offering announced at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference. This product is built to enhance user experience for Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) customers by integrating AI into Apple devices. Many investors now consider Apple Intelligence to be the next big growth driver for both revenue and product demand.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 184 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $124.2 billion.\n\nBaron Funds said the following about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc.

        "title": "Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Dividend Stock According to Warren Buffett?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Warren Buffet-approved dividend stocks.\n\nWarren Buffett is a well-known figure in the investment community, and his reputation requires no introduction. He is one of those rare investors whose strategies are closely emulated by countless newcomers to the field. This widespread admiration stems from the fact that Buffett operates in a class of his own. He remains committed to the investment principles he has relied on throughout his career, particularly value investing. The Oracle of Omaha’s lack of enthusiasm for the current AI trend highlights his steadfast dedication to the strategies that have guided his investment approach for decades.\n\nAt the Berkshire annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett was asked about AI's potential impact on traditional industries. He responded by acknowledging that he was not knowledgeable about the technology but emphasized that this lack of understanding did not imply he dismissed its existence, importance, or significance in any way. That said, Buffett is also enthusiastic about several other strategies beyond value investing.\n\nAlso read: Warren Buffett Disciple Guy Spier’s 10 High Conviction Stock Picks\n\nDividend stocks have been a staple in Berkshire's portfolio for a long time, with nearly 93% of the holdings focused on them. The media has often highlighted Buffett's affinity for dividend stocks, particularly because Berkshire Hathaway, his own company, does not pay a dividend. His approach has proven successful, as the investment portfolio managed by Buffett and his team is projected to generate around $6 billion in annual dividend income. Remarkably, $4.36 billion of that income from common and preferred stock dividends comes from just five companies.\n\nBuffett’s approach to dividend investing isn’t driven by chasing the highest yield. Instead, he prioritizes identifying outstanding companies that can maintain and grow their dividends over the long term. He prefers a moderate yield from a stable, successful company over a higher yield from a less reliable and weaker one. If Warren Buffett has a preference for dividends, it’s clear he’s on the right track, given how significantly these stocks have contributed to overall market returns. His love for dividend stocks reflects the significant role these equities have played in contributing to the market's overall returns over the years. Between 1993 and the end of 2022, the S&P 500 grew by 777%. However, when dividends were factored in, the S&P 500 saw an increase of over 1,400% during the same period. This indicates that dividends accounted for more than 20% of the market’s total return during those years.\n\nBuffett carefully monitors the sectors and industries he invests in, which is a core aspect of his investment strategy. By the end of Q2 2024, the finance sector was the largest portion of his portfolio, followed closely by technology, with substantial investments also in basic materials and consumer goods. This article will explore some of the best Warren Buffett dividend stock selections across these different sectors and industries.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we analyzed Berkshire Hathaway's 13F portfolio as of the second quarter of 2024 and picked dividend stocks from the portfolio. We mentioned the sectors and industries these stocks belong to and ranked them in ascending order of the hedge fund's stake in them during Q2 2024.\n\nWe also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 912 funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $84,248,000,000\n\nSector: Information Technology\n\nIndustry: Consumer Electronics\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tops our list of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks. The hedge fund reduced its massive stake in the tech giant during the second quarter of 2024, which was unexpected given Buffett’s reputation for long-term investing. The fund's AAPL stake was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating that Buffett had sold just over 49% of the tech investment. Despite this reduction, the company remained by far Berkshire's largest stock holding. Buffett had already cut the Apple stake by 13% in the first quarter and mentioned at the Berkshire annual meeting in May that the sales were partly for tax reasons. He suggested that selling \"a little Apple\" this year could benefit Berkshire shareholders in the long run if future US tax policy increases capital gains taxes to address a growing fiscal deficit. The company represented over 30% of the firm's 13F portfolio.\n\nWhere Berkshire slashed its AAPL stake, Baron Funds reinitiated its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the second quarter of 2024. The firm highlighted the strengths in the company's business in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile.

We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported strong earnings in its fiscal Q3 2024. The company's revenue for the quarter came in at $85.7 billion, which saw a 4.8% growth from the same period last year. In addition, its cash position was also stable, generating $29 billion in operating cash flow. The company returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.44%, as of August 21. In May this year, the company raised its dividend for the 12th consecutive year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a popular stock among elite funds during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. The hedge fund positions in the company jumped to 184 in Q2, from 150 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of more than $124 billion.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Third Point Management, a New York-based investment advisor, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Third Point Offshore Fund returned 1.8% net in the second quarter compared to a 4.3% return for the S&P 500 INDEX (TR) and a 2.8% return for the MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR). In the first half of 2024, the Offshore Fund made profits across all strategies, achieving a 9.8% net return. Over the previous 12 months, the fund yielded a 17.0% net return. Although technology businesses accounted for a major portion of returns over this period, much of the portfolio is invested in various sectors, such as utilities, industrials, consumer, and healthcare.

Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.\n\nDespite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying Up These Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the biggest winner of the AI boom thus far, but not everyone thinks the good times will last.\n\nIn fact, hedge funds continued to reduce their exposure to the popular stock in the second quarter, continuing a trend from the first quarter. In the period, which included Nvidia's reaching an all-time high market cap in June after its stock split, 326 hedge funds trimmed their positions, according to Whale Wisdom, while 264 hedge funds increased their positions.\n\nWhile many of the hedge fund managers who cut their holdings in Nvidia still hold large stakes in the AI stock, their decisions to reduce their exposure to it shows they think that the stock's biggest gains may be behind it. Let's take a look at a two of the stocks that billionaire investors are buying to replace Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIt shouldn't be a big surprise to find Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on hedge funds' shopping lists. Not only is it the biggest holding in the stock portfolio of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, but it's also the most valuable company in the world and a longtime winner on the stock market.\n\nApple appeared to be lagging in the AI race, but the company changed that impression when it unveiled its new Apple Intelligence platform, which features AI tools like a writing assistant and image generation, and will soon be available on the most advanced iPhones. The move also underscores Apple's key advantage in AI -- its installed base of more than 2 billion devices, which allows it to put its software and services in front of a vast number of users.\n\nOne of the hedge funds that pared back its Nvidia holdings and bought Apple last quarter was GQG Partners, a boutique investment firm based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the second quarter, GQG sold nearly 58 million Nvidia shares and added 11.3 million shares of Apple. Nvidia remains GQG's biggest holding, but it sold more than 40% of its shares in the GPU maker. Its Apple stake is entirely new.\n\nKen Griffin's Citadel Advisors, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, also exchanged some Nvidia stock for Apple in the quarter. It added 2.6 million shares of Apple worth roughly $500 million in the quarter. At the same time, it sold 9.3 million shares of Nvidia, or roughly $1 billion worth, leaving it with just 2.4 million shares. Citadel has additional exposure to Nvidia through options.\n\n2. Lyft\n\nWhile Apple appears to be a logical choice for hedge fund investors looking to rotate out of Nvidia, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) is more surprising. Shares of the No. 2 ride-sharing company have fallen sharply since its 2019 IPO -- its early valuations were unsustainable, and the pandemic dealt its business a setback as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Lyft now looks primed for a comeback under a new management team that has scaled back spending on incentives and rolled out popular new options such as giving women riders and drivers the ability to match with other women. Revenue jumped 41% year over year to $1.44 billion in the second quarter, and it reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.\n\nBillionaire investors seem to be taking notice. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management added 7.5 million shares of Lyft in the first quarter, or roughly $100 million. Meanwhile, he dumped nearly all of his Nvidia stake, selling 3.7 million shares to leave the fund with just 690,000 shares of the AI stock.\n\nGriffin's Citadel also added to its stake in Lyft, buying 4.4 million shares of the ride-sharing stock in the quarter, or roughly $50 million.\n\nFor a company the size of Lyft -- its market cap is less than $5 billion -- that indicates a considerable amount of bullishness from the professional investing set. Combined, Tepper and Griffin own more than 3% of the stock.\n\nLyft is a much different company than Apple, but the buys by Griffin and Tepper, as well as the momentum in its turnaround efforts, should give retail investors confidence to buy the stock. There's a lot of upside potential here as its financials continue to improve.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has 52.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's $312 Billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Phenomenal Stocks",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the smartest investors around and has been for decades. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett offers tons of investment advice and commentary in his annual letters to shareholders and at the conglomerate's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nBuffett's advice tends to be straightforward, but one topic that he can sound contradictory on is diversification. He's a staunch advocate of most investors sticking with S&P 500 index funds. He has even directed the executor of his estate to invest 90% of the money he leaves to his wife in an S&P 500 index fund after he passes. Such funds offer a diverse portfolio of stocks representing numerous industries.\n\nAnd yet, Berkshire Hathaway's $312 billion investment portfolio is heavily concentrated in just a few stocks. Its top three holdings account for nearly 53% of the portfolio's value. On that point, Buffett makes a great analogy: \"If you have LeBron James on your team, don't take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. ... It's crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your first choice.\"\n\nHere are Buffett's top three choices right now, which combined account for the majority of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple (29%)\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holdings. Not only did Buffett spend an estimated $37 billion acquiring a stake in Apple from 2016 through 2018, but the stock has appreciated greatly since then.\n\nAt one point, it accounted for more than 50% of Berkshire's equity portfolio. Buffett called Apple \"a better business than any we own,\" referencing Berkshire's portfolio of wholly owned companies like Geico and See's Candies. Recently, Buffett trimmed the position over the last three quarters, including a massive sale of nearly half of Berkshire's remaining stake in the second quarter. Still, Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding by far, and Buffett expects it to remain the largest position in its portfolio for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Apple. The company's ecosystem of hardware and services provides stable revenue as customers generally remain extremely loyal to the brand. Its services business provides a nice area of high-margin revenue growth for the business while the stalwart iPhone ensures that cash flow remains high. Significant share buybacks give an additional boost to its earnings per share every year. And when a new growth catalyst comes along, like the potential for a surge in iPhone upgrade rates due to the pending debut of new AI features, it provides a significant bump in earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt its current price, the stock trades for around 30 times forward earnings. That's a premium to the S&P 500, but the stock is arguably worth it as significant cash on its balance sheet and robust share buybacks support strong returns for shareholders.\n\n2. American Express (12%)\n\nBuffett, through Berkshire, acquired a substantial stake in American Express(NYSE: AXP) in the mid-1990s, and he hasn't done much with the position since. It's a true buy-and-hold story.\n\nBuffett pointed to the value of his investment in Amex during his 2022 letter to shareholders. The annual dividends paid on Berkshire's original $1.3 billion total investment in the stock climbed from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million that year. More importantly, the stock has grown in step with Berkshire Hathaway, and even faster over the past year and a half. In his 2023 letter to shareholders, he said Berkshire's share of Amex's earnings from the prior year exceeded the $1.3 billion originally invested two decades ago.\n\nOn the subject of American Express, he said, the lesson is clear: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays.\" Indeed, Berkshire's Amex position is now worth about $37.5 billion.\n\nWhat separates American Express from other credit card networks is that it issues the cards as well as manages the payment network. That allows it to retain greater control and capture a greater share of the economics of card transactions. That business has treated it extremely well as more and more transactions move from cash to digital payment tools like credit cards. Amex is quickly expanding its network, particularly internationally, where it lags behind its largest rivals, enhancing the network effect of the business.\n\nMore recently, Amex has turned to lending as a growth opportunity. Historically, it required charge card balances to be paid in full every month, but now, some of its cards permit users to carry a balance. Its net interest income grew 20% year over year in the second quarter, accounting for 23% of net revenue.\n\nIt has also driven revenue growth by increasing its card fees, while still maintaining its popularity with high-value, high-income consumers. That provides additional protection for Amex against economic slowdowns relative to other card issuers and payment networks.\n\nShares currently trade near an all-time high, but with a forward P/E ratio of 19, the stock still presents good value.\n\n3. Bank of America (11.6%)\n\nAnother financial stock sitting near the top of Buffett's roster of all-stars, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) was a more recent addition to the portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway first acquired preferred shares in the bank in 2011, plowing $5 billion into it -- a highly public vote of confidence in the bank at a time when investor sentiment toward it had soured in the wake of the mortgage crisis. Along with the 5% dividend paid by the preferred shares, Buffett received warrants to buy 700 million shares of BofA's common stock anytime over the next decade for $7.14 each.\n\nIn 2017, Buffett exercised those warrants because Bank of America raised its quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share, meaning that Berkshire could get more in dividends from the common stock than the preferred shares. So he sold the preferred stock to cover his common stock purchase. Buffett went on to add to the position over the next few years.\n\nRecently though, Berkshire trimmed about 12% of its stake in BofA. The reason was likely the same as the one behind the Apple stock sale. Berkshire currently benefits from favorable corporate tax policies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. It's sitting on massive gains from its common stock shares of BofA, which currently trade around $38.50.\n\nBank of America struggled during 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve hiked benchmark U.S. interest rates to curb surging inflation. It held a relatively high amount of long-duration bonds on its balance sheet that lost value on paper as those interest rates climbed. That led to a decline in BofA's net interest income as it had to pay higher interest rates on customers' deposits while collecting lower interest rates from pre-2022 bonds. But the worst appears to be behind BofA as interest rate cuts appear to be on the horizon. Management believes that its net interest income reached the bottom of its trough in the second quarter.\n\nShares currently trade for 1.5 times tangible book value, which is a fair price to pay even as earnings remain under pressure from interest rates. While Buffett sold some Bank of America shares recently, a 12% cut in Berkshire's stake shouldn't be viewed as signaling that anything is wrong with the business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is atop the throne as the largest company in the world. It leads second-place Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by $280 billion, but I don't think it will maintain its leadership position.\n\nIn the next five years, I think multiple companies will overtake Apple, but two picks are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). These two have a strong case for becoming larger than Apple, but it won't happen overnight.\n\nWhy am I bearish on Apple?\n\nFirst off, let's talk about Apple. In my opinion, Apple is trading so high due to its past performance. If you look at the performance without the name attached, Apple isn't currently that great of an investment. If I approached you with a stock that posted shrinking revenue for five of the last seven quarters, and in the two quarters it delivered growth, the best growth rate was 5%, you'd probably pass. Throw in the fact that this company is trading at 34 times forward earnings, and you'd run for the hills.\n\nBut, because Apple is Apple, investors give it a pass. This won't go on forever, and eventually, something will give. This opens up a lane for Alphabet and Amazon to surpass it, as they still have multiple growth catalysts ahead of them.\n\nCloud computing is a huge part of Amazon's and Alphabet's investment thesis\n\nWhile many think of Amazon as just an e-commerce channel, it's much more than that. Commerce businesses have notoriously low margins, so Amazon has multiple other divisions that help boost its profits. One of the fastest growing is its advertising services, which has been on fire over the past few years.\n\nAnother strong segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing offering. AWS is the largest cloud computing business by market share but has recently delivered slightly less growth than its competition. However, AWS' growth has reaccelerated, which is a huge selling point for the stock.\n\nAlthough AWS makes up 18% of Amazon's revenue, it accounted for 64% of its operating profit in the second quarter. Though Amazon's business is much broader than cloud computing, its cloud services are a massive part of the Amazon investment thesis. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion in 2029, it has a huge demand wave pushing it.\n\nAn investment in Alphabet is also an investment in its advertising business. With ad revenue making up around three-fourths of total revenue, it's a huge part of its business. Many are worried its search engine dominance may come to an end with competitors like OpenAI entering the arena. However, I think these concerns are overblown, as it would require billions of people to change their habits very quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don't see that happening anytime soon, so I'm not concerned about some of the increased competition.\n\nAnother bonus for Alphabet is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. While Google Cloud isn't as big as AWS, it's still a big part of the growth story, as cloud computing is in huge demand thanks to the AI arms race.\n\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet have their primary businesses, but their cloud computing wings are huge reasons to consider buying the stocks. Apple doesn't have the same kind of growth catalysts pushing it, so don't be surprised if either of these two passes up Apple within the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia earnings highlight a busy end of August: What to know this week",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told investors on Friday \"time has come for policy to adjust.\"\n\nIn response, stocks finished the week near record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.\n\nBut the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test this week with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.\n\nEarnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.\n\nA done deal\n\nOn Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.\n\nBut he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.\n\nPowell noted the timing and pace of cuts will \"depend on incoming data,\" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has \"ample room\" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.\n\nWith only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.\n\n\"We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],\" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 38.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen the day prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nCapital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.\n\n\"Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,\" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\"As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.\"\n\nWhile Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomists expect annual \"core\" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.\n\nPowell said on Friday his confidence has \"grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.\"\n\nAll eyes on Nvidia\n\nWith nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.\n\nAs has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.\n\nThe stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.\n\n\"We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,\" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.\"We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.\"\n\nVinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.\n\n\"Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,\" Vinh said.\n\nCharles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment office Omar Aguilar said the release will be a \"very anticipated\" release for the broader market too.\n\n\"What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,\" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday.

(I-HWA CHENG/AFP via Getty Images) (I-HWA CHENG via Getty Images)\n\nTech volatility could be 'behind us'\n\nWhipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.\n\n\"I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,\" Snider said.\n\nThe rally in this group — which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia — between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.\n\n\"The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,\" Snider added. \"Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.\"\n\nFor the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.\n\nSnider said this move \"speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.\"\n\nHe added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed \"some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.\"\n\n\"In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,\" Snider said.\n\nNow, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. \"I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,\" Snider said.\n\nNothing like price to change an investor's feelings.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, July preliminary (+4.2% expected, -6.7% previously); Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, August (-16 expected, -17.5 previously)\n\nEarnings: Trip.com (TCOM)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, August (100.1 expected, 100.3 previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.34% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, June (+6.81% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, August (-17 previously)\n\nEarnings: Bank of Montreal (BMO), Box (BOX), Nordstrom (JWN)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending Aug. 23 (-10.1% prior)\n\nEarnings: Nvidia (NVDA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Affirm (AFRM), Bath & Body Works (BBWI), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Chewy (CHWY), Foot Locker (FL), Five Below (FIVE), HP (HPQ), Kohl's (KSS), Okta (OKTA), RBC (RBC), Salesforce (CRM), The J.M.

        "title": "Nvidia gets ready to take over the stock market (again)",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nAre you ready for the single most important earnings report of 2024?\n\nInterestingly, this company won the award for the single most important earnings report of 2024 (and every quarter in 2023) when it reported three months ago!\n\nI am talking about Nvidia (NVDA). Earnings are out on Aug. 28 after the close of trading.\n\nEvery day, I get to the office by 4:20 a.m. and turn on some software we use to track which stories and ticker pages are garnering the most interest from Yahoo Finance readers. Every single day, one of the most actively viewed pages on our platform is for Nvidia.\n\nThe world could be on the cusp of an alien attack, and I fancy people will still be hitting refresh on the Nvidia ticker page. Investors have become absolutely obsessed with a company they had never even heard of two years ago.\n\nI can't blame them.\n\nNvidia's stock is up 170% in the past year. Nvidia's stock is up 3,000% in the past five years.\n\nThese are insane gains, the type that lure in the less-experienced investor hoping to retire early.\n\nAnd Nvidia's story is surprisingly easy to grasp despite the company's incredibly complicated business. Nvidia makes the best artificial intelligence chips in a world being upheaved by AI. Simple. No one is even close to Nvidia in terms of AI chip performance and forward-looking demand.\n\nI do want to caution that the setup on Nvidia going into the quarterly report is a little different this go around. While the Street is staying super bullish on Nvidia heading into the print, they are a touch cautious amid reported shipment delays for Nvidia's powerful new AI chip Blackwell.\n\nThere is good reason for the bullishness based on a host of recent signals from earnings reports:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just cited strong AI demand when it reported. AMD (AMD) recently lifted its sales for data center chips for the third time in a year. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cited strong demand for its liquid cooling solutions. Nvidia chip customer Meta (META) just raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 and 2025 by billions.\n\n\"We expect Nvidia to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs. Given the Blackwell delay, we believe Nvidia will prioritize the ramp of B200 for hyperscalers and has effectively canceled B100, which will be replaced with a lower cost/performance GPU (B200A) targeted at enterprise customers,\" Keybanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Nvidia's report to be embraced, I think investors need to see at least two things:\n\nNvidia must convey that reported Blackwell shipment delays aren't a structural issue. Nvidia must show strong quarter-over-quarter sales growth in its data center business.\n\nIf this happens, it could shake off a few bears and set the table for what EMJ Capital founder and tech investor Eric Jackson told me on the Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\"I'm saying [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,\" Jackson said.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.2 trillion or so currently.\n\nJackson reasons the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report this week or in November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.\n\nRest up. It's going to be a busy week ahead.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations with the biggest names in business and markets on my Opening Bid podcast.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Made His Biggest Stock Sale Ever. Here's What the Tax Bill Could Be.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett hasn't seen a lot to like in the stock market recently. He's sold more stock than he bought for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) equity portfolio in each of the last seven quarters. But last quarter Buffett made his biggest stock sale in the history of the company.\n\nBerkshire unloaded 389,368,450 shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Those shares are valued around $88 billion at the time of this writing. Berkshire received less for the shares as Apple traded below its current level throughout the second quarter.\n\nThat makes the third straight quarter Buffett sold shares of Apple, but last quarter's sale was by far the largest. He sold 10 million shares in the fourth quarter followed by 116 million shares in the first quarter, and the 389 million in the second quarter.\n\nAt Berkshire's most recent shareholder meeting, Buffett said the sales of highly appreciated assets like its Apple investment take advantage of the current tax code. Still, the tax bill will be quite hefty for Berkshire this year. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nHere's how big the tax bill could be\n\nApple shares traded between $165 and $216 during the second quarter. The average closing share price during the period was $186.49. If we assume Buffett received the average share price on the sale, just so we can do some that, that would be proceeds of $72.6 billion.\n\nBerkshire accumulated the bulk of its Apple position between 2016 and 2018, paying an estimated $36.51 per share on a split-adjusted basis. If every single share sold last quarter came from that lot of purchases and sold at the Q2 average, Berkshire Hathaway would have produced a gain around $150 per share for the 389 million shares sold. That's a $58.4 billion gain.\n\nBerkshire also sold a big chunk of Apple shares in the first quarter, when the stock traded for an average price of $181.83. The estimated gain on that sale is $16.9 billion. That would be a total gain of $75 billion on Apple stock sales alone, and we're only halfway through the year.\n\nUsing these calculations, at the current federal corporate tax rate of 21%, Berkshire would have to pay Uncle Sam about $15.8 billion out of the proceeds from the stock sale. Nebraska currently charges a corporate tax rate of 6.5%, so Berkshire will have to pay its state government an additional $4.9 billion.\n\nThat said, the current tax code saved Berkshire shareholders a lot of money compared to several years ago. The 2017 tax cuts lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Under the old law, Buffett's sale would've cost an additional $10.5 billion. President Joe Biden has proposed a 28% corporate tax rate to go into effect when the 2017 tax cuts expire after next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow will a massive tax bill impact Berkshire shareholders?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway shareholders may be wondering how this tax expense will impact the company's earnings. The good news for investors is that Berkshire accounts for its tax liability on unrealized capital gains each quarter as a deferred tax expense. In other words, the bulk of the tax on Apple's gains has probably already been accounted for during previous quarters' earnings reports. That's why investors didn't see a sudden surge in tax expenses on Berkshire's second-quarter report.\n\nAs a result, earnings won't be affected by the stock sale (other than the missed earnings from any continued rise of Apple's shares). That said, the sale will result in a real cash expenditure, which management warns will impact cash flows. \"Operating cash flows over the remainder of 2024 will be reduced by significant income tax payments derived from taxable gains on disposals of equity securities,\" management wrote in its second-quarter earnings release.\n\nDespite the hefty tax bill, Berkshire has more than enough cash on hand to pay the government. As of the end of June, it held $277 billion in cash and short-term Treasury bills. A measly $20.7 billion in taxes won't change the fact that Buffett has more cash than he has good investment options for Berkshire.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Upgrades for Crocs, Roku, BrightView Holdings",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, MoffettNathanson initiated on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at Neutral with a $211 price target.\n\n*TLDR: MoffettNathanson ponders the question of Apple’s valuation being too high and/or beyond its fair value. The firm further has concern over Apple’s AI potential noting “unclear data on acceptance in Greater China and potential regulatory challenges.”\n\nWhat’s the full story? MoffettNathanson analysts question whether Apple’s valuation has overshot, noting that the stock price reflects an iPhone upgrade cycle expected to be significantly larger than the 5G cycle of 2021/22. They express skepticism about this assumption and highlight the overlooked regulatory risks associated with Apple’s contract with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for the default search position. While the firm expects Apple to execute its strategy well, they believe the market has already priced in this expectation. The key question remains whether the anticipated upgrade cycle driven by Apple Intelligence will be larger or smaller than expected.\n\nThe firm also raises concerns about Apple’s future beyond AI, including the unclear data on Apple’s acceptance in Greater China and potential regulatory challenges that could impact Apple’s competitive ability. Despite a positive bias towards Apple’s AI strategy, MoffettNathanson concludes that the current valuation suggests the market has already accounted for these factors. They recommend waiting for a shake in market confidence before making further investments.\n\nNeutral at MoffettNathanson means “Neutral recommendations are typically within 15% of fair value.”\n\nAMD\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Edward Jones initiated coverage on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) at Buy without a price target. AMD was also added to Edward Jones Stock Focus List\n\n*TLDR: Edward Jones analysts believe AMD will see significant growth due to rising demand for data-center infrastructure and the integration of Xilinx’s programmable chip products, with a potential $10 billion opportunity. The firm also highlights that the rebounding PC market, driven by AI-enabled PCs, could lead to sustained growth, which is not yet fully reflected in AMD’s current share price.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Edward Jones analysts believe that AMD is poised for significant growth due to several key factors. The increasing demand for data-center infrastructure is expected to boost sales of AMD’s chips, particularly GPUs and CPUs. Additionally, the acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) has introduced new programmable chip products and expanded AMD’s market reach. The analysts suggest that AMD is still in the early stages of integrating and cross-selling Xilinx and AMD products, with management estimating this opportunity could be worth up to $10 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the analysts highlight that the PC market, which has begun to rebound, could see sustained growth driven by AI-enabled PCs, potentially leading to a longer upgrade cycle. They assert that this optimism is not yet fully reflected in AMD’s current share price, indicating potential for further appreciation.\n\nBuy at Edward Jones means “We believe the valuation is attractive and total return potential is above average over the next 3-5 years compared with industry peers.”\n\nBrightView Holdings\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Jefferies upgraded BrightView Holdings (NYSE:BV) to Buy with a $17 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies upgrades BV to Buy from Hold, expecting low single-digit revenue growth and record margins, driven by a new CEO’s leadership and significant progress over the past 10 months. The brokerage anticipates margins to expand from ~11% in FY23 to over 13%, supported by cost-cutting, profitable growth, and improved client and employee retention.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Jefferies has upgraded BrightView from Hold to Buy, anticipating a return to low single-digit percentage revenue growth and record-breaking margins. This optimism is driven by the leadership of a new CEO with an exceptional track record, who has made significant progress at BV over the past 10 months. The brokerage expects margins to expand from approximately 11% in FY2023 to over 13%, supported by the company’s focus on cost-cutting, profitable growth, and improved client and employee retention.\n\nThe brokerage’s confidence in BV’s future performance is bolstered by the upgraded management team and the strategic initiatives implemented under the new CEO. These efforts are expected to drive both revenue growth and margin expansion, positioning BV for a strong financial performance in the coming years.\n\nBuy at Jefferies means “Describes securities that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.”\n\nCrocs\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Williams Trading upgraded Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) to Buy with a $163 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Sidney Sweeney’s role as brand ambassador will attract young consumers and boost HEYDUDE’s visibility, increasing FY24 and FY25 revenue estimates to $873 million despite guidance of an 8%-10% decrease. The analysts stress a “clean marketplace” and “data-drive allocation choices” for Crocs/HEYDUDE in order to pressure competitors such as VANS.\n\nWhat’s the full story? The research team believes that Sidney Sweeney’s addition as brand ambassador/global spokesperson will attract young consumers and bring much-needed attention to the HEYDUDE brand. Williams Trading expects the agreement with Sweeney to last through at least 2025. Consequently, the research team has increased their FY24 and FY25 revenue estimates for HEYDUDE from $859.5 million to $873 million, despite guidance indicating a revenue decrease of 8% to 10% for FY24. They are confident that Crocs’ history of long-term brand marketing driving short-term positive results will begin to manifest at HEYDUDE.\n\nThe analysts emphasize the importance of maintaining a clean marketplace and implementing a pull model for both Crocs and HEYDUDE. They stress the need for sales and merchant teams to fully embrace data analytics for allocation and distribution decisions and to stop MAP holidays within core styles and silhouettes. Reviewing the spring '25 product lineup, the team notes that offerings for both brands are becoming more focused. New products like the Crocs Echo Wave Mule and Echo Surge Sneaker, along with the return of the Bae platform clog, are expected to perform well. The introduction of the Wally and Wendy Comf and updated styles from HEYDUDE show promise, provided demand is accurately planned and properly allocated. The increased focus on HEYDUDE may further pressure competitors like Vans and other canvas casual footwear brands in the near term.\n\nBuy at Williams Trading means “The stock’s total return (price appreciation plus dividend yield) is expected to exceed more than 15% over the next 12-month investment horizon.”\n\nRoku\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Guggenheim upgraded Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) to Buy with a $75 price target\n\n*TLDR: Monetization is improving. Investors are likely to realize management's efforts to improve ad sales.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Guggenheim expects investor enthusiasm for Roku to grow leading into the 3Q earnings in November, as the company progresses in broadening video inventory advertising sales via third-party demand-side platforms and improving home screen monetization. This progress is anticipated to bolster confidence in Roku as a unique top-line acceleration story in 2025. The brokerage’s revised rating reflects financial estimates ahead of consensus for 2024 and 2025, and an attractive relative valuation based on a 15% normalized OIBDA margin, which they believe the company will achieve through revenue growth and cost management.\n\nDespite concerns about Roku’s slow leadership response in the connected TV marketplace and competitive pressures in advertising and CTV, Guggenheim believes that strengthened monetization and leadership execution by Roku Media President Charlie Collier and CFO Dan Jedda should bolster growth and disciplined performance over the next three to six months. This is expected to drive further investor enthusiasm and better position the company for long-term outperformance.\n\nBuy at Guggenheim means “Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month period.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrades for Crocs, Roku, BrightView Holdings\n\nBreaking down Morgan Stanley's list of top European stocks to own\n\n2025 a likely headache for OPEC\n\nView comments",

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Buy Nvidia stock ahead of earnings; BIDU downgraded",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nConcerns over Nvidia Blackwell delays ‘overdone,’ says Evercore\n\nEvercore ISI analysts recommend buying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker’s upcoming earnings report for the July quarter, saying that recent worries about potential delays in the release of the Blackwell system are “overdone.”\n\nThe investment bank emphasizes that demand for Nvidia's systems remains strong, as highlighted by a 20% quarter-on-quarter increase in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) during Q2 2024. Looking forward, CapEx is anticipated to grow by an additional 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4.\n\nEarlier reports indicated that Nvidia’s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which features its next-generation AI chips, might face delays of up to three months. This news sparked investor concerns over the sustainability of Nvidia's stock rally.\n\nEvercore analysts reviewed past Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, concluding that while a negative announcement could result in a short-term stock drop of 5%-10%, Nvidia has consistently shown resilience in quickly developing alternative solutions.\n\n“Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,” the analysts remarked.\n\nEvercore continues to view Nvidia as its “Top Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,” asserting that the company is well-positioned to capture up to 80% of the value in the parallel processing era. Analysts also project that Nvidia could achieve more than $10 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2030 “and that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.”\n\nThey have raised their estimates for Nvidia’s third-quarter and 2024 performance, along with increasing its target price for the stock from $145 to $150.\n\nMoffettNathanson: Apple’s AI potential is already priced in\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioned to be a significant player in the AI space, but this potential is already factored into its stock price, MoffettNathanson said in a note to clients.\n\nThe firm, which initiated coverage of Apple with a Neutral rating and set a price target of $211 per share, acknowledged Apple's strong AI strategy but noted that the market has already anticipated and priced in these developments.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Apple is poised to win in AI,\" MoffettNathanson analysts said, but cautioned that \"that's exactly what's already priced in.\"\n\nThey observed that despite earlier concerns about Apple lagging in AI, the market has consistently shown confidence in the company's strategy. This was particularly evident after the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), where Apple confirmed much of its AI plans.\n\n\"By the time of their June WWDC, the broad strokes of Apple's 'contextual awareness' AI strategy were already well-anticipated by the tech intelligentsia, and hence by the market as well,\" the note states.\n\nMoffettNathanson emphasized that Apple's AI approach leverages the trust of its over one billion users, especially in handling personal data like contacts and emails, which remain exclusively under Apple's control.\n\nThe firm also said that Apple's strategy is likely to drive an iPhone upgrade cycle, but the potential impact of this cycle is already reflected in the current stock valuation.\n\n\"Apple’s new AI functionality would be presented in service of driving an iPhone upgrade cycle – Apple is, after all, still primarily a hardware provider – as capitalizing on resident inference capabilities would require at least 8 GB of RAM and a neural processor that phones older than the iPhone 15 Pro don’t have,\" they explained.\n\nEdward Jones initiates AMD stock coverage\n\nEarlier in the week, analysts at Edward Jones initiated research coverage of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and added the semiconductor giant to its Stock Focus List.\n\nThe firm sees multiple catalysts that could drive significant growth for AMD in the coming years.\n\nA key factor behind Edward Jones' optimistic outlook is the rising demand for data center infrastructure, which is expected to propel sales of AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs).\n\nThe analysts highlighted that \"growing demand for data center infrastructure should help drive accelerating sales\" of these critical products.\n\nAnother driver of Edward Jones' bullish stance is AMD's acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).\n\n\"While the acquisition of Xilinx adds new programmable chip products and end-markets to AMD's business, we believe the company remains in the early innings of cross-selling and integrating Xilinx and AMD products,\" the firm stated.\n\nThe integration of Xilinx’s programmable chip products with AMD’s existing offerings is still in its early stages, but Edward Jones sees significant potential for cross-selling opportunities, which management estimates could be worth as much as $10 billion.\n\nIn addition, the firm points to the potential for a prolonged upgrade cycle in the PC market driven by AI-enabled PCs, which could further support AMD's growth.\n\nAnalysts believe that the positive outlook for AMD is \"not fully reflected in the share price,\" presenting an attractive investment opportunity at current levels.\n\nBofA double downgrades Silicon Motion to Sell\n\nShares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) fell Friday after Bank of America analysts issued a double downgrade on the NAND flash controller supplier.\n\nThey cut their rating on SIMO stock from Buy to Underperform, citing expectations of limited growth following the upturn in the first half of 2024.\n\nAnalysts pointed out that the company’s guidance for the second half already indicates minimal top-line growth compared to Q2 2024. Their updated analysis also suggests low growth in 2025 for sales, operating profit (OP), and earnings per share (EPS).\n\n\"A key reason is likely the low exposure to AI and enterprise SSD, areas more dominated by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix, respectively,” analysts wrote.\n\nBofA has also reduced its EPS estimates for the second half of 2024 and 2025 by approximately 20%, driven by lower revenue and operating margin assumptions compared to their earlier forecasts.\n\nThe investment bank highlighted that SIMO’s revenue primarily comes from “controller IC chips” for NAND products, setting it apart from its competitor, Phison Electronics.\n\nGiven the expectation of limited growth beyond the first half of 2024, the analysts have lowered their price objective for SIMO to $60 from $90.\n\nMore broadly, BofA also noted that while demand for AI server chips remains strong, demand for commodity memory has significantly weakened.\n\nBaidu downgraded at Bernstein on share pressure expectations\n\nBernstein analysts on Friday downgraded Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) from Outperform to Market Perform following the company's latest earnings report and cut their price target from $130 to $97.\n\nThe analysts foresee the stock trading sideways due to increasing disruption and reduced clarity on future prospects.\n\n\"We expect more disruption to the near-term Search results and any limited signs of success in next few quarters (that would have allowed investors to look through to the longer term),\" they noted.\n\nThe firm also lowered its Search growth expectations by 5 percentage points for the second half of 2024 and by 3 percentage points for 2025, currently valuing the stock on a bearish outlook without factoring in any potential gains from AI Search initiatives.\n\n\"AI Cloud and Robotaxi are positive, but without Search showing a revival, we expect that shares will remain under pressure,\" Bernstein analysts added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Buy Nvidia stock ahead of earnings; BIDU downgraded\n\nBreaking down Morgan Stanley's list of top European stocks to own\n\n2025 a likely headache for OPEC\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here’s Why Wall Street is Excited About Apple’s (AAPL) Upcoming New iPhone Event in September",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.\n\n“Now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions,” Sluymer reportedly said.\n\nMany others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.\n\n“If you look at what we’ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it’s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it’s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,” Ives said.\n\nFor this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?\n\nPixabay/Public DomainIs Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a new report that Apple’s iPhone 15 production was stronger than expected in July, with growing momentum leading up to the iPhone 16 launch. Analysts, led by Erik Woodring, reported that their checks from the Greater China Tech Hardware team showed iPhone builds in July surpassed initial expectations, prompting an upward revision of September quarter iPhone builds to 54 million units, an 8% increase year-over-year and 2 million units higher than previously forecasted.\n\nWhile the real test will be early October’s iPhone sales, the analysts noted that momentum appears to be building as the iPhone 16 launch approaches. The increase for the September quarter reflects the continued strength of the iPhone 15 late in its cycle, with no changes to the production of other iPhone models. However, it’s unclear if this trend is driven by anticipation for Apple Intelligence or other factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple’s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Up 69% in 2024, This Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock Could Keep Soaring",
        "content": "Semiconductor specialist Cirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) may not be a household name like some of its industry peers, but the company has done impressively well on the market so far this year with gains of 69% as of this writing.\n\nCirrus, which is known for supplying chips for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) products, has outpaced the broader Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's gains of 10% by a big margin. The good news is that Cirrus' outstanding growth is here to stay, and the company could finish the year strongly thanks to its largest customer. What's more, the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smartphones is likely to unlock a massive long-term growth opportunity for Cirrus Logic.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the reasons why investors should consider buying Cirrus Logic stock hand over fist before it's too late.\n\nCirrus Logic's recent results point toward a bright future\n\nCirrus Logic released fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended June 29) on Aug. 6. The company's revenue increased 18% year over year to $374 million and was well ahead of the consensus estimate of $318 million. What's more, Cirrus' adjusted earnings jumped a solid 67% year over year to $1.12 per share, crushing Wall Street's $0.61 per share estimate.\n\nThe positive news didn't end here, as Cirrus expects its fiscal Q2 revenue to land between $490 million and $550 million. The midpoint of the guidance range stands at $520 million, and that's well above the Wall Street estimate of $485 million. Cirrus clocked revenue of $481 million in the same quarter last year, indicating that its top line is on track to increase by 8% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nCirrus' top line could land closer to the higher end of its guidance range thanks to its largest customer, Apple, which accounted for a whopping 88% of its top line last quarter. Cirrus management pointed out on the recent earnings conference call that its revenue exceeded the top end of its original guidance range thanks to \"stronger than expected shipments into smartphones.\"\n\nBecause Apple is Cirrus' largest customer, the stronger-than-expected performance means that Cirrus got more orders for its chips last quarter. That's not surprising, as Apple seems to be preparing for an aggressive rollout of its next-generation iPhones that are all set to support generative AI features.\n\nApple's rumored iPhone 16 is expected to hit the market next month and the tech giant is expected to ship 90 million units of its updated smartphone lineup this year. That would be a 10% increase over last year. But at the same time, supply chain reports indicate that Apple is stocking up on 120 million display panels, suggesting that it may end up manufacturing more units than what the market is currently anticipating.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf that's indeed the case, Cirrus Logic's growth in the current quarter is likely to exceed expectations once again. But more importantly, the integration of the Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features into the tech giant's upcoming smartphones is expected to trigger a solid upgrade cycle. Apple's smartphone shipments are expected to increase by 10% in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, according to JPMorgan's estimates.\n\nCirrus is expected to land more dollar content in the next generation of iPhones, which means that it should be able to receive more revenue from each unit of the iPhone that Apple produces. So, the stage seems set for Cirrus Logic to end the year strongly, and it should be able to sustain its newly found momentum in the future as well thanks to Apple's entry into the AI smartphone market, a space that's currently in its early phases of growth.\n\nA couple more reasons to buy the stock\n\nAnalysts have been quick to raise their earnings growth expectations for Cirrus Logic, as is evident from the chart below. CRUS EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nCirrus Logic finished fiscal 2024 (ended on March 30) with non-GAAP earnings of $6.59 per share. The above chart tells us that analysts weren't expecting an increase in Cirrus' earnings in the current fiscal year, but that has changed of late. Additionally, the company's bottom-line growth forecast for the next fiscal year points toward an improvement in its growth rate.\n\nHowever, if Apple indeed decides to ramp up the production of its upcoming iPhones and Cirrus ends up supplying more content to the tech giant, there is a good chance of Cirrus' earnings easily outpacing analysts' expectations going forward.\n\nThat's why now would be a good time for investors to buy this semiconductor stock. It's trading at just 26 times trailing earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31.

        "title": "If You Bought 1 Share of Apple at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now",
        "content": "Few stocks boast a pedigree as impressive as Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL). Not only is the consumer technology giant the first publicly traded outfit to reach a trillion-dollar market cap, it's also often the world's most profitable company. It has earned its status as an investor favorite.\n\nApple's stock has split several times since its initial public offering back in 1980, of course. It essentially had to, in order to accommodate the organization's incredible growth.\n\nAnd that raises a curious question: If you bought one share of Apple at its IPO, how many would you own now?\n\nApple's stock-split history (and IPO price recalculation)\n\nApple's stock has been split five times since going public in December 1980. The first was 1987's 2-for-1 split, followed by another 2-for-1 split in mid-2000. The next split came in early 2005...another 2-for-1 deal.\n\nThen the party really started. Following the explosive revenue growth driven by 2007's debut of the iPhone, Apple shares saw a 7-for-1 split in mid-2014 and underwent a 4-for-1 split again in mid-2020.\n\nCrunching the numbers, one share of Apple back in 1980 would have become 224 shares today. Adjusting for all of these splits, the stock's IPO price of $22 per share is effectively dialed back to $0.10.\n\nApple is an exception to the norm, but...\n\nApple's is an extremely unusual case, of course. Most stocks don't need to be split as much as this one's been.\n\nNevertheless, not every stock needs to do as well from its inception to make you very, very wealthy. One or two of these mega-winners will do the trick. The challenge is just figuring out which companies have true long-term growth potential and which ones don't. For every winner like Apple, there seems to be a handful of disappointing names like Blue Apron or Groupon. Take your shots, but be discerning and realistic as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top 25 Eco-Friendly Companies in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the top 25 eco-friendly companies in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Top 5 Eco-friendly Companies in 2024.\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\n\nJuly 2024 broke the 175-year record reaching unprecedented levels of global temperatures. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2024 is likely to be the hottest year on record, beating 2023 which was previously the hottest. This presents a stark reminder that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in our environment is leading to global warming and is changing the climate.\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is a framework used to assess corporate performance across key factors regarding the environment, society, and corporate governance. It is becoming crucial for businesses seeking long-term success and circularity. KPMG highlights that companies must integrate ESG into their core strategies to excel sustainably. As regulations become more stringent, companies face higher pressure to improve transparency and accountability in their ESG practices. For instance, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into existence in January 2023, requires all large and publicly listed companies to reveal risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental issues and their impact on the environment and people.\n\nREAD ALSO: 15 Countries at Risk of Climate Disaster and 20 Countries with the Most Carbon Dioxide Emissions Per Capita\n\nCorporate's Sustainable Performance\n\nGreenhouse gases are on the rise despite global pledges to reduce them. Climate crises are escalating continuously, but the progress toward carbon neutrality is rather sluggish. However, there seems to be some progress as corporate leaders are increasing their investments in sustainable solutions signifying their commitment to green transition, according to the 2024 report by Corporate Knights.\n\nWhile many companies, particularly in the fossil fuel and banking sectors, remain immune to major changes, the leaders are doubling down on sustainability. The top-ranked firms in the 2024 Global 100 allocated 55% of their investments to sustainable projects, up from 47% the previous year. The global 100 companies are investing more in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable solutions compared to the broader publicly listed companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Moreover, these companies earned 51% of their revenues from sustainable sources, higher than the 16% average. Sustainable investments play a pivotal role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's Commitment to Sustainable Growth\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) not only leads the tech world but is also a frontrunner in sustainability. The iPhone maker reached carbon neutrality in 2020, paving the way for future sustainability goals for companies. Since 2015, the company has reduced its emissions by more than 55% while growing its revenue by 64% at the same time. It promotes the adoption of renewable energy and material circularity by decarbonizing its supply chain. Its commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is evident by its significant efforts to make over 320 suppliers commit to 100% renewable energy consumption for Apple products. It invests heavily in renewable energy and aims to reach 100% clean electricity by 2030. It pledges to match every watt of electricity associated with product use by customers with its renewable energy investments.\n\nThe tech leader has also made significant investments in carbon sequestration and removal projects. It aims to invest up to $200 million and remove at least 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has supported more than 18 gigawatts of clean energy and delivered billions of gallons of water benefits. Its renewable energy investments have generated over 16.5 gigawatts of clean energy in its supply chain, avoiding more than 18.5 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions. Its conservation efforts have led to 76 billion gallons of water saving since 2013.\n\nApple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) commitment to sustainability and ESG positions it as a leader in the industry, for other companies to follow suit. It boasts a robust ecosystem of products and services, with over 2 billion installed devices. The company is poised for growth as its attached services such as iCloud, App Store, and Apple Music get adopted more widely. This interconnectedness creates a loyal and engaged clientele, fueling consistent demand. Moreover, its new iPhone 16 series is braced for further growth driven by AI capabilities. Investors believe that the latest satellite connectivity in iMessage will majorly drive iPhone sales.\n\nThe ability of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to leverage technological dynamics and ensure sustainable production practices solidifies its commitment to innovation. Baron Opportunity Fund said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nNow, let's look at the top 25 eco-friendly companies in 2024.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning to hold its biggest product launch event of the year on Sept. 10, when the company will unveil the latest iPhones, watches and AirPods, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago's Migrant Surge Is Stirring Trouble for Democrats in DNC Host City Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message With Self-Driving Vans, Hamburg Tries to Make Microtransit Work UK Transport Minister Clears Path for More 20mph Speed Zones\n\nThough the timing hasn’t yet been announced, the company is making preparations for that date, which falls on a Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The unveiling will be followed by the phones going on sale Sept. 20, in line with Apple’s typical approach in recent years.\n\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe launch is a critical one for Apple, which has suffered sluggish sales of its smartphones and wearable devices in recent quarters. A Sept. 20 release of the new iPhone 16 would mean some of the device’s revenue is recorded in the current period — Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter — when the company expects sales to grow about 5% from a year earlier.\n\nA bigger chunk of sales will come the following quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. Analysts have predicted that revenue will climb 7% to $128.4 billion in that period.\n\nThe iPhone 16 will have larger screens on its Pro models and new camera features, such as a dedicated button for snapping photos. The company also is rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence tools called Apple Intelligence. Overall, though, the phones won’t be vastly different than last year’s models.\n\nApple’s wearable devices, meanwhile, are due for bigger changes. The Apple Watch Series 10 models will be thinner but include larger screens. And Apple is revamping its AirPods lineup with new low-end and mid-tier versions. For the first time, the company will offer noise cancellation on its mid-level AirPods, and the entry-level model is getting updated for the first time since 2019.\n\nThe company is also planning to begin transitioning its Macs over to M4 processors later this year, but Mac updates typically don’t arrive until about a month after the annual iPhone launch.\n\nTo that end, the company has ramped up testing of four new Mac models to ensure compatibility with third-party applications, according to developer test logs seen by Bloomberg News. That’s a key step prior to launching the new machines. The Macs that appeared are labeled with the identifiers “16,1,” “16,2,” “16,3” and “16,10.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThey all represent models with base-level versions of the M4 chip. Three of the Macs have 10 total cores in their central processing units, or CPUs, while one low-end version includes eight total cores — a measure of performance. The versions with 10-core CPUs also have 10-core GPUs, or graphics engines. The model with an eight-core CPU, meanwhile, has an eight-core graphics engine. They all have either 16 or 32 gigabytes of memory.\n\nThe 10-core CPU has the same specifications as the M4 processor in the iPad Pro, including four high-performance parts and six cores focused on efficiency. But the fourth chip seen in the developer logs only includes eight total cores, split between four high-performance parts and four efficiency cores.\n\nBloomberg News has reported that a smaller Mac mini, new MacBook Pros and updated iMacs with M4 chips are coming later this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck FOMO Frenzy Fuels Taiwan Home Prices Despite Threat of China Invasion Five Questions With Deval Patrick at the DNC ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC failed to beat the S&P 500 Index last quarter despite holding some of the best-performing megacap technology stocks in its flagship fund, according to a Friday letter to investors from the fund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago's Migrant Surge Is Stirring Trouble for Democrats in DNC Host City Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message With Self-Driving Vans, Hamburg Tries to Make Microtransit Work UK Transport Minister Clears Path for More 20mph Speed Zones\n\nThe flagship Offshore Fund rose 1.8% in the second quarter, trailing the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain on a total return basis in the same timeframe. It’s a similar story to the first quarter, when the fund also trailed the broader market despite having nearly half of the equity portfolio in companies linked to artificial intelligence.\n\nThe fund added to its AI bid in the second quarter, picking up shares of the Magnificent Seven’s Apple Inc. The fund took a position in April, when it saw the iPhone maker as under-owned by institutional investors with a compressed multiple.\n\n“We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years,” Third Point wrote.\n\nIn the second quarter, hedge funds overall trimmed positions in most of the so-called Magnificent Seven mega-caps, with the exception of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com. The iPhone maker saw the biggest increase in hedge fund purchases by market value in the three months through the end of June, with an aggregated net buy of more than 8.5 million shares, according to Bloomberg analysis of 13F filings.\n\n“In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment,” Third Point wrote in the letter, saying that while the market narrative is dominated by the Magnificent Seven, they see “even more reason” to add other names to the portfolio.\n\nPositions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Vistra Corp. rounded out the top five performers during the quarter, the letter said. The fund also added to positions Corpay Inc., Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and London Stock Exchange Group PLC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe top five negative contributors for the quarter were Corpay, Bath & Body Works Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc., Ferguson PLC and Airbus SE, the letter said.\n\nStocks have whipsawed since the end of the second quarter. Investors rotated out of large companies in mid-July in favor of smaller and riskier sectors. In recent weeks, that’s reversed, with big tech stocks rebounding and the S&P 500 back near all-time highs.\n\nThird Point expects that volatility will continue through year-end, and said it’s adjusted its portfolio accordingly. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is trading around 16 after jumping as high as 65 earlier this month.\n\n“We modified certain exposures with this scenario in mind and worked quickly to mitigate losses during the downdraft,” the fund wrote in the letter. “We are eager buyers of dislocated securities, particularly in credit, should we see further turmoil.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck FOMO Frenzy Fuels Taiwan Home Prices Despite Threat of China Invasion Five Questions With Deval Patrick at the DNC ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Biggest Bets in 2024: 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's $276.9 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in Just 2 Stocks",
        "content": "With a market capitalization of more than $950 billion, Berkshire Hathaway ranks as the world's eighth-largest company. Led by CEO and world-famous investor Warren Buffett, the company has delivered incredible returns for its long-term shareholders and continues to be massively influential in the investing world.\n\nNotably, the Oracle of Omaha has never been much of a fan of portfolio diversification and has instead preferred to weight Berkshire's stock holdings heavily toward a small number of high-conviction investments. But Buffett and Berkshire have actually been making some dramatic moves lately, and the balance of the company's portfolio has shifted in some big ways.\n\nLet's take a look at two of the stocks where he's most invested in now. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nDespite big changes, this is still Buffett's biggest bet\n\nKeith Noonan (Apple): Berkshire Hathaway shocked the world with its recent 13F filing. With the disclosure report it submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month, the investment conglomerate revealed that it had sold more than 389 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. The move reduced Berkshire's total investment in the tech giant by 49%, and immediately raised concerns that Buffett was losing faith in the tech leader.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock investment by far. Even after the sell-off, the iPhone company's stock still accounts for roughly 28.8% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio -- more than three times larger than its second-biggest position.\n\nWhile Buffett has argued against diversification in the past, it's not hard to see why his company opted to reduce its exposure to the tech giant. At its concentration and valuation peak, Apple accounted for more than half of Berkshire's total stock portfolio.\n\nThe investment has been a massive winner for the Oracle of Omaha's company, and the recent stock sale has generated enviable profits. But the question of whether Berkshire will continue to take profits on its Apple investment will likely remain a hotly contested issue until Buffett's company publishes its next 13F filing.\n\nBuffett has previously described Apple as \"probably the best business\" he knows of, but there are some big questions about what comes next for the mobile leader. For starters, it remains to be seen whether Apple will be able to deliver big wins in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Investors and analysts are also wondering whether the company can serve up major new wins in mobile and other hardware categories that are capable of driving big growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire's moves to trim its position in Apple stand out among this year's most high-profile moves for institutional investors. But while Buffett has reduced his company's exposure to the mobile leader, it seems like he's still bullish on the stock overall.\n\nThe classic, forever Buffett stock\n\nJennifer Saibil (American Express): There are two stocks Warren Buffett has repeatedly said he would never sell: Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), his longest-held stock, and American Express(NYSE: AXP), his second-longest.\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC), though, was his second-largest position for a long time. Recently, after Buffett sold a chunk of BofA and did some other reallocation of his portfolio, American Express has slid into that slot. It accounts for 12.2% of Berkshire's total equity holdings as of this writing.\n\nAmerican Express is a great example of the classic Buffett stock. For starters, it trades at less than 19 times trailing 12-month sales. That's well below the average S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 27. Buffett loves undervalued stocks, and as long as American Express stock trades at a low valuation, he's likely to stick with it.\n\nIt has an established, distinctive model. It's different than credit card networks Visa(NYSE: V) and Mastercard(NYSE: MA) in a few important ways. It's a closed-loop system, which means that it acts as its own bank and doesn't rely on third-party relationships to fund the credit it provides shoppers to use when they spend. Since it has its own bank, it has an expanded set of services that give it more ways to make money. Buffett loves companies that have a varied set of earnings streams. He also loves bank stocks, since they tend to have lots of cash, which is the anchor of a long-term viable company.\n\nAmerican Express has a fee model. Its loyal cardholders pay annual fees for the privilege of using most of the company's cards, which come with a slew of perks. It's also known for its top rewards program, which keeps cardholders paying year after year and attracts new ones.\n\nAmerican Express has successfully refreshed its image and most of its cards to appeal to a younger, affluent cohort, and they have a long runway of spending ahead. The niche, upscale target market gives American Express a moat against challengers, as well as resilience under pressure.\n\nThat's another way American Express fits into the Buffett model. It plays a large role in the development of the economy, and cardmembers rely on it for necessities and luxuries. Expect American Express to keep up its good work and keep providing value for Buffett and other shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Earnings season is winding down but investors will still have plenty to watch next week as key companies across various sectors provide updates that could offer valuable insights into market trends.\n\nIn the tech sector, AI darling Nvidia is expected to offer a glimpse into the ongoing impact of the artificial intelligence (AI) hype on the semiconductor industry, potentially revealing whether enthusiasm for AI is translating into tangible growth.\n\nMeanwhile in London, financial services firm Prudential will show investors if it has managed to turn around its performance. Shares in the company have slumped amid less than stellar performance of the Hong Kong and China economies.\n\nCrowdStrike will also report its results in the cybersecurity arena, with investors eager to see how the company behind the recent global outage is performing.\n\nIn the sneaker fashion world, Foot Locker is seeing analysts upgrading its stock ahead of earnings but Wall Street still expects a quarterly loss.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) — Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nAll eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA) next week, as the chip giant at the heart of the AI boom, is set to release its second-quarter results on 28 August.\n\nNot only does Nvidia hold an 80% to 95% share of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters, but it is also the world’s third-largest company by market capitalisation at $3.04tn (£2.31tn), having briefly held the top spot back in June.\n\nThe AI darling is the single best performer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index and a leading member of the Philadelphia Semiconductor index — known as the SOX (SOX=F) — point out AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst for the platform.\n\nNvidia is also part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven', which alongside other tech heavyweights including Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), is a group of stocks that make up more than a third of the S&P 500’s stock market value and a fifth of the FTSE All-World (AW01.FGI) equity index’s market capitalisation.\n\n“These seven names have gone a long way to helping equity markets go higher, so if they stumble then the effects could be felt widely,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nNvidia shares are up 149.87% year-to-date, though the stock sold off heavily in July and into early August. The share price has recovered some ground since then but fell 3% in yesterday’s trading session ahead of the highly anticipated earnings report next week.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks advance as UK energy price cap rises to £1,717\n\nStory continues\n\n“From a fundamental, earnings point of view, Nvidia has demolished consensus estimates and raised guidance for each of the past five quarters, which helps to explain its stellar share price performance,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.\n\nNvidia said it expects revenues of $28bn for the second-quarter, which is more than double the $13.5bn it reported for the same period last year. If Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offers any steer on the third quarter, Hewson and Coatsworth say the current consensus forecast on revenue is $30.7bn, versus $18.1bn for Q3 last year.\n\nBased on Huang’s guidance for gross margins, operating expenses and tax charges, Hewson and Coatsworth said this implies a net profit of $15bn for the second quarter, which is more than double the figure reported last year, but broadly flat on the previous quarter. They said this also suggests headline earnings per share (EPS) of $0.63 for Q2, up from $0.61 in the first quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, they said that analysts will be keeping an eye out for comments from Huang on reported delays in the launch of Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips.\n\n“Production of Blackwell was due to ramp up in the second half of this year, as Nvidia looks to maintain its technological lead by quickly improving upon the Hopper chipset,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.\n\nPrudential (PRU.L) — Reports first-half results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nAnother company reporting on Wednesday is financial services firm Prudential, which has seen its shares fall by nearly a third over the past year, slumping to 12-year lows.\n\nAJ Bell’s Hewson and Coatsworth said that the shares have been “dragged down by markets’ disappointment with how the economies of Hong Kong and China are failing to show markedly improved momentum after the conclusion of their lengthy lockdowns imposed because of Covid-19.”\n\nThey explained that Prudential is now a play on demand for financial services in Asia and Africa, following the spin-off of fund manager M&G (MNG.L) in 2019, a fundraising in Hong Kong in 2021 and its 2022 demerger from Jackson Financial (JXN).\n\n“Prudential’s long-term strategy is to position itself for both population growth as well as increased prosperity and the rise of the middle class, as this is potentially the sweet spot for increased demand for financial products and services,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.\n\nHong Kong was Prudential’s most profitable market in 2022, followed by Singapore, Mainland China, Malaysia and Indonesia, with it highlighting India, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines as high-growth markets.\n\nRead more: 'We've grown £11m pizza delivery sales with no experience'\n\nPrudential’s CEO Anil Wadhwani, who took the reins earlier last year, set out two new financial objectives, one of which was to achieve a compound growth of 15% to 20% in new business profit between 2022 and 2027.\n\nNew business profit jumped 45% to $3.1bn in 2023, but Hewson and Coatsworth note that this was flat in the first quarter of 2024 on a constant currency basis, despite the firm pointing to a headline figure of 11% growth “excluding economic impacts” on a constant currency basis.\n\nAnother metric that they said would be in focus is Prudential’s operating profit, which on an adjusted basis came in at $2.9bn in 2023, up 8% on the previous year.\n\nPrudential paid out a dividend of 20.47 cents (16.5p) per share in 2023, with Hewson and Coatsworth saying that analysts expect a 6% increase in these distributions to the equivalent of 17.5p a share. The company announced a 2023 first interim dividend of 6.26 cents, or 5.16p, per share.\n\nHewson and Coatsworth said that another figure that investors will be looking at is Prudential’s annual premium equivalent, as a measure of new business written. This increased by 37% to $5.9bn in 2023 and grew by 7% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of this year, “thanks to a tough base for comparison in Hong Kong and China and a slowdown in Vietnam\".\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nCrowdStrike is set to report its second-quarter financial results on Wednesday, 28 August with the market keenly focused on the aftermath of the July IT outage that has significantly impacted the company’s valuation.\n\nThe cloud-based security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.4%, according to Zachs Research. Revenues are expected to be $958.66m, up 31% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe cybersecurity leader has seen its market value sharply decline after its involvement in a Microsoft-related IT disruption that caused widespread chaos. The incident, attributed to “a single content update for Windows hosts”, led to severe disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, emergency services and media outlets globally, according to CrowdStrike president George Kurtz.\n\nIn the wake of the outage, businesses affected have initiated legal action against both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Notably, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) has filed claims, citing losses ranging from $350m to $500m after being forced to cancel more than 6,000 flights.\n\nAs investors await CrowdStrike’s earnings call, they are particularly interested in how the ongoing legal challenges will impact the company’s financial health. However, Wedbush analysts have suggested that the financial damage may be less severe than initially anticipated.\n\nRead more: McDonald's targeted by grimace memecoin promoters\n\nAccording to legal experts cited by Wedbush, CrowdStrike’s potential liabilities from Delta’s lawsuit are likely to be in the \"single-digit\" millions, thanks to favourable user contracts that limit the company’s exposure to claims for revenue losses and liability.\n\nDespite these reassurances, there are concerns that the reputational damage from the outage could lead to a loss of future business, a risk that may weigh on CrowdStrike's long-term prospects.\n\nCiti (C) analysts said that CrowdStrike won't come out of the incident \"unscathed\" given higher discounts, lower negotiating leverage, and litigation costs it now faces.\n\nFoot Locker (FL) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August\n\nCiti has revised its outlook on Foot Locker, increasing the price target from $27 to $33, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This change comes in anticipation of Foot Locker’s second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday before the US bell.\n\nCiti's analysis say Foot Locker may outperform consensus expectations for both sales and earnings per share in the second quarter.\n\nIts optimism is driven by stronger-than-expected comparable store sales and gross margins, bolstered by the robust performance of several key brands in Foot Locker’s portfolio, including Adi Terrace, New Balance, Hoka, and On.\n\nDespite underperformance from Nike (NKE), Foot Locker’s largest brand, Citi believes the retailer will show a positive inflection in comparable sales for the second quarter, recovering from last year’s promotional pressures that negatively impacted gross margins.\n\nThe retailer is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.09 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 325%. However, revenues are projected to reach $1.88bn, marking a 0.9% increase compared to the same quarter last year, according to Zachs Research.\n\nFoot Locker’s management is expected to reaffirm its fiscal year 2024 guidance, though third-quarter projections may come in below consensus due to anticipated weaker gross margins.\n\nRecent analyst actions showcase a range of views on Foot Locker’s prospects. Following a disappointing first-quarter performance in 2024, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from Equalweight to Underweight, lowering the price target to $18 due to a more cautious outlook for 2024 (EPS, driven by expectations of a decline in both top-line growth and gross margins).\n\nArgus also maintained a Hold rating on Foot Locker, expressing caution about near-term earnings pressure as the company navigates a strategic transformation. Conversely, Jefferies, Barclays and Telsey Advisory Group have raised their price targets to $26, $27, and $27, respectively, recognising Foot Locker’s recent performance.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 26 August\n\nNo major companies reporting\n\nTuesday 27 August\n\nCNOOC (600938.SS)\n\nBHP (BHP.L)\n\nVinci (DG.VI)\n\nWednesday 28 August\n\nHochschild Mining (HOC.L)\n\nCosco Shipping (CICOF)\n\nAir China (AIRYY)\n\nChina Construction Bank (601939.SS)\n\nWuliangye Yibin (000858.SZ)\n\nAgeas (AGS.BR)\n\nBrunello Cucinelli (8BU.F)\n\nNetApp (NTAP)\n\nBath & Body Works (BBWI)\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF)\n\nCampbell Soup (CPB)\n\nKohl’s (KSS)\n\nJM Smucker (SJM)\n\nThursday 29 August\n\nSouth32 (S32.AX)\n\nQantas (QAN.AX)\n\nPernod Ricard (RI.PA)\n\nDelivery Hero (DHER.HM)\n\nFriday 30 August\n\nDell (DELL)\n\nMarvell (MRVL)\n\nDollar General (DG)\n\nBrown-Forman (BF-B)\n\nBest Buy (BBY)\n\nBirkenstock (BIRK)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Big Tech dominance is forcing index superpowers to rethink rules",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Big Tech boom is causing headaches for all-powerful index providers on Wall Street, who can send billions of benchmark-tracking dollars on the move with just a stroke of the pen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChicago's Migrant Surge Is Stirring Trouble for Democrats in DNC Host City Sydney Central Train Station Is Now an Architectural Destination With Housing Costs High, Democrats Hone YIMBY Message With Self-Driving Vans, Hamburg Tries to Make Microtransit Work UK Transport Minister Clears Path for More 20mph Speed Zones\n\nTwo of the world’s biggest – FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices – are presenting plans to undercut the weighting of the largest megacap companies in key indexes. The rare intervention comes as the US equity market becomes increasingly lopsided thanks to the growing dominance of the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nPlayers of all stripes are being forced to adapt as the ownership of the largest tech shares in many portfolios starts to push against regulatory limits. And the pressure is building for the two index overlords, whose products are tracked by a combined $35 trillion.\n\nThe proposals offer fresh ammunition for critics of the passive-investing boom, who have long pointed out such strategies are more active than they appear. Any adjustments in an index reveal the hidden human hands behind the benchmarks.\n\n“Most investors may not realize that there is some degree of activeness even in what we consider passive strategies,” said Antti Petajisto, head of equities at Brooklyn Investment Group.\n\nRussell’s consultation, which is about capping the weighting of the largest members of its widely followed US growth and value gauges, is open until Aug. 30, with no time frame set for implementation.\n\nS&P’s consultation — focused on a new approach to restrain companies in a family of sector measures — ends Friday, with the changes scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23 if they are adopted.\n\nBehind the proposals are longstanding rules for regulated investment companies that limit any single security to 25% of a portfolio and the aggregate weight of the largest holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%. In the industry it’s often dubbed 25/5/50.\n\nEstablished to safeguard investors from over-exposure to too few names, the restrictions can be punishing in the modern market where companies such as Apple and Nvidia keep getting bigger.\n\nLast month, the top 10 constituents of the Russell 1000 Index — which are mainly tech stocks — comprised 34% of the gauge. While that’s not yet testing 25/5/50, it’s a level of concentration unseen in the benchmark’s 45-year history.\n\nStory continues\n\nRussell already offers a suite of capped indexes to supplement its more traditional, unconstrained measures. What’s being considered now is whether to apply weight caps to its standard style gauges, according to Catherine Yoshimoto, director of product management at FTSE Russell, an LSEG business. More than $7 trillion of assets are benchmarked to the firm’s style indexes.\n\n“Some clients are really pushing us to consider capping the standard Russell 1000 Growth Index, for example,” she said.\n\nA spokesperson for S&P declined to comment beyond the consultation paper and its index methodology.\n\nPassive funds have been grabbing market share from their active rivals in the past two decades, thanks to rock-bottom costs and the perceived shortcomings of discretionary stock pickers. Still, some market participants like to point out that this index revolution is less radical than it appears.\n\nIn this view, top-down decisions are made by humans in virtually every stage of a “passive” strategy, whether it’s writing the rules of an index, deciding how to apply them, designing the fund that tracks the benchmark, or actually executing its trades. For instance, contrary to what many assume, the S&P 500 Index — the main benchmark for the world’s largest stock market — does not simply contain America’s 500 biggest companies. Its members are selected by a group of anonymous index experts.\n\nThe proposed changes by S&P and Russell underscore the kinds of interventions that take place — and the differences between firms that can arise as a result.\n\nWhen it comes to adhering to the 25/5/50 limits, index managers use differing mechanisms to cap a company’s weight, as well as different triggers for when that process kicks in (although they all typically opt for a level slightly below 25/5/50 to provide a buffer.)\n\nFor example, in its proposal, Russell presents a capping threshold at 20/4.5/48. That’s different from the Nasdaq 100, whose methodology calls for 24/4.5/48, and S&P, whose cutoff is 24/4.8/50. The disparity likely reflects diverse approaches to determine the best way to reduce the probability of a breach occurring on a regular basis, according to Yoshimoto at Russell.\n\nMeanwhile to cap company weights, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim top holdings proportionally. But when a number of stocks breach the limit in S&P’s sector gauges, the smallest is trimmed first, suppressing its weight in the gauge — and leaving investors under-exposed.\n\nThat’s what happened in funds like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) in the first half of this year, when Nvidia was surging higher. The rules meant XLK under-owned the stock, so it trailed an uncapped tech benchmark by 10 percentage points in the period — the worst underperformance on record.\n\nThen, when Nvidia eclipsed Apple in June, it sparked a rebalance in which XLK bought an estimated $11 billion shares of the chipmaker at the expense of the iPhone manufacturer. Now that their positions are flipped again, XLK is at risk of another round of big shuffling. Should the current rankings hold until the next quarterly rebalance due September, Nvidia’s weight in the fund may have to drop to 4.5% from 21% as Apple’s spikes to 22% from 4.8%, based on the existing methodology.\n\nS&P’s proposed revision is aimed at reducing such frequent high turnovers, according to Edward Yoon, an index specialist at Macquarie Capital. Rather than targeting the smallest of the group that violates the diversification rule, the index owner proffers curbing them all in proportion to their market values.\n\nTo Josh Kutin, head of asset allocation, North America at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, whatever emerges from the consultations is surely no bad thing as it will help investors tackle the challenge of the increasingly concentrated market.\n\n“Asset allocators are obsessed with getting diversification so the more concentrated our portfolios are in any sense, the more uncomfortable we get,” he said. “I’m in favor of changes to reduce the reliance on market cap in index construction, even if that’s a human decision rather than a market mechanism.”\n\n--With assistance from Yiqin Shen.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck FOMO Frenzy Fuels Taiwan Home Prices Despite Threat of China Invasion Five Questions With Deval Patrick at the DNC ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "62% of Warren Buffett's $314 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 4 Unstoppable Stocks",
        "content": "On Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is truly in a class of his own. Without using fancy software or trading algorithms, the Oracle of Omaha has, over nearly six decades, nearly doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500. On an aggregate return basis, we're talking about Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) increasing in value by roughly 5,387,100% under Buffett's watch.\n\nWhen you deliver outsized returns on Wall Street, you tend to draw a crowd. Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting regularly lures in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors eager to hear Buffett speak about the U.S. economy, the stocks Berkshire holds, and his investment philosophy. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut thanks to quarterly filed Form 13Fs, we don't have to wait a full year to get the skinny on what Warren Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling.\n\nAlthough Berkshire Hathaway closed out the June quarter with 45 stocks and two exchange-traded funds in its approximately $314 billion investment portfolio, one of the key traits that's allowed Buffett and his team to vastly outperform the S&P 500 for so long is concentration. In other words, Buffett and his team strongly believe in putting extra capital to work in their best ideas.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Aug. 16, 62% ($193.3 billion) of the $314 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in just four unstoppable stocks.\n\nApple: $90.42 billion (28.8% of invested assets)\n\nAs has been the case for many years, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire's top holding.\n\nHowever, the Oracle of Omaha and his team have dumped a significant percentage of their company's stake in Apple over the prior three quarters. This position once briefly accounted for up to 50% of Berkshire's invested assets.\n\nAlthough Buffett opined during his company's latest annual shareholder meeting that he believes Apple is a great company, he also hinted that corporate tax rates are liable to climb in the coming years. With Berkshire Hathaway sitting on a mountain of unrealized gains from its Apple stake, Buffett presumed that investors would eventually come to appreciate he and his team locking in gains and paying a historically low tax rate.\n\nWarren Buffett is also an unabashed fan of Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Adding the $26.5 billion spent on share buybacks during the company's fiscal third quarter (ended June 29, 2024), Apple has put a whopping $700 billion to work repurchasing its stock since the start of 2013. Buybacks can incrementally increase the ownership stakes of investors, as well as provide a lift to earnings per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the cautionary tale with Apple is that its growth engine has mostly stalled. While revenue tied to its subscription ecosystem have steadily grown, sales for physical devices, including iPhone, have been less than impressive.\n\nAmerican Express: $38.2 billion (12.2% of invested assets)\n\nThe second longest-tenured stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, credit-services goliath American Express(NYSE: AXP), is currently Buffett's second-largest holding. AmEx, as American Express is commonly known, has been a continuous holding since 1991 and is considered by Buffett to be one of his company's eight \"indefinite\" holdings.\n\nFinancials are Buffett's favorite sector to put his company's money to work in, and the reason why is simple: they're cyclical.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha and his top aides are fully aware that economic contractions and recessions are normal and inevitable. Rather than foolishly (small 'f') trying to guess when these downturns will occur, Berkshire's brightest minds are playing a numbers game that's very much in their favor. Since recessions are short-lived -- nine out of 12 recessions since the end of World War II resolved in less than 12 months -- and most periods of expansion last multiple years, it pays to buy and hold high-quality businesses that grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy.\n\nWhat makes AmEx special is its ability to benefit from both sides of the transaction aisle. It's currently the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., which allows it to collect fees from merchants.\n\nBut it's also a lender to consumers and businesses via its various credit cards. This helps facilitate the collection of annual fees and interest income. Being able to double dip during lengthy periods of economic expansion and play from both sides of the retail counter has been its not-so-subtle secret to success. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBank of America: $37.08 billion (11.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe third-largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's 45-stock, $314 billion portfolio overseen by Buffett is money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Following the sale of more than $3.8 billion worth of BofA shares by Berkshire's investment team between July 17 and Aug. 1, Bank of America has fallen behind AmEx in the pecking order.\n\nBuffett's love for bank stocks also revolves around their cyclical nature. During recessions, banks usually contend with higher loan losses and credit delinquencies. By comparison, their loan portfolios typically expand during substantially longer periods of economic growth.\n\nWhat's made Bank of America such an attractive investment over the last two years is its sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\n\nBeginning in March 2022, the Federal Reserve kicked off its steepest rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. No money-center bank has benefited more, in terms of added net interest income, than BofA. Conversely, an expected rate-easing cycle has the potential to adversely affect Bank of America's net interest income more than its peers. This may be why Buffett has his crew have been sellers of late.\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America's management team hasn't been shy about investing in digitization. As of the midpoint of 2024, 77% of its consumer households were banking digitally and 53% of all consumer loans were completed online or via mobile app. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, which should eventually lead to improved operating efficiency for BofA.\n\nCoca-Cola: $27.67 billion (8.8% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth top holding in Buffett's $314 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway that, along with Apple, American Express, and Bank of America, collectively accounts for 62% of invested assets is beverage kingpin Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola is Buffett's longest continuously held investment at 36 years (since 1988).\n\nThe beautiful thing about consumer staples stocks is they're a necessity no matter what's going on with the U.S./global economy or the stock market. As a provider of brand-name beverages, demand for the company's products tends to be highly predictable year after year.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that Coca-Cola is one of the most recognized brands in the world. Its marketing team leans on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while relying on well-known brand ambassadors and over a century of history to connect with its mature consumers.\n\nTo add to this point, Kantar's annual \"Brand Footprint\" study found that Coke's products have been the most-chosen from retail shelves for 12 consecutive years. Having strong branding usually translates into exceptional pricing power.\n\nThe cherry on top for Coca-Cola is that it's a geographically diverse company. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has operations ongoing in every country.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, Apple, Alphabet, NVIDIA, iShares Semiconductor ETF, Advanced Micro Devices and Arm",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 23, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM, Intel Corp. INTC, Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Arm Holdings plc ARM.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nThe Better Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now: TSM or INTC\n\nThe semiconductor industry has witnessed stupendous growth over the past four decades, with chips becoming an integral part of electronic devices like computers and smartphones, to name a few. An increase in acceptance of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to fuel demand for semiconductors.\n\nManufacturing, healthcare, and retail sectors have already integrated digital technologies that require robust semiconductor solutions. Thus, the global semiconductor industry is likely to witness a CAGR of 14.9% from 2024 to 2032, hitting $2062.59 billion by 2032, per Fortune Business Insights.\n\nHowever, despite the positive trend, picking the top semiconductor stocks is challenging since their sales fluctuate incessantly. So, here is one chip stock to buy right away — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. — and one industry bigwig to shun — Intel Corp.\n\n2 Reasons to Be Bullish on TSM\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expects healthy demand for its chips as more companies begin to implement AI features in smartphones. Apple Inc.’s initiative to launch the iPhone 16 this fall should boost demand for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s chips. The new “Apple Intelligence” system has already benefited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple is one of the biggest clients of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and accounts for around one-fourth of TSM’s revenues.\n\nDemand for AI applications like Alphabet Inc.’s Gemini and Open AI’s ChatGPT has increased noticeably. But such applications require huge data, kept in data centers, which rely on graphic processing units (GPUs) that NVIDIA Corporation manufactures. And without TSM’s manufacturing prowess, the GPUs can’t be operative. So, in a way, the surging demand for AI applications would continue to boost Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s sales over the next several years and help its shares soar.\n\nNo doubt, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s earnings outlook for the current year remains promising, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% from a year ago.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s shares have already outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF this year (+64.6% vs. +22.6%).\n\n2 Reasons to be Bearish on INTC\n\nIntel, regrettably, is losing its competitive edge over its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Intel is in a fix after failing to make much progress in its foundry business. AMD has progressed significantly in producing high-performance processing machinery. Intel’s failure to take advantage of the ever-growing AI applications industry is alarming against the strong growth posted by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is currently the industry standard.\n\nOn the other hand, Arm Holdings plc is disrupting Intel’s server, storage, and networking space. ARM’s designs in the micro server segment have witnessed espousal by quite a lot of Intel’s competitors. As a result, Intel’s earnings outlook for the current year remains bleak, with the $0.38 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share down a massive 77.5% from a year ago.\n\nIntel’s shares have underperformed SOXX year to date, down 57.4%. Notably, both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are listed in SOXX.\n\nTSM Fundamentals – Very Strong\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, by the way, has generated profits more competently than Intel. This is because TSM has a return on equity (ROE) of 25.5%, while Intel’s is around 4.4%. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is primarily considered very strong.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a stable business model. Its dividend payout ratio sits at 31% of earnings, a low payout that indicates the company is reinvesting the bulk of its earnings in research and development, a must for growth. Whereas, Intel’s dividend payout ratio is 109% of earnings, which is unsustainable.\n\nTSM Less Pricey Than INTC\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s shares are less expensive than Intel’s, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an edge over the world’s largest semiconductor company. After all, buying INTC’s shares will burn a larger hole in your wallet than the TSM stock.\n\nThis is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, TSM stock presently trades at 26.5X forward earnings. However, INTC’s forward earnings multiple is 56.6X.\n\nTSM to Buy Hand Over Fist\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, rightfully, is a better buy than Intel as it is well-positioned to make the most of the growth in AI, can generate profit consistently, and has a lower valuation.\n\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of TSM by almost 19% from the company’s last closing price of $172.04. The analysts’ highest price target is at $250.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "The Cheapest Trillion-Dollar Stock: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta?",
        "content": "Six U.S. companies are valued at $1 trillion or more, and they all operate in the technology sector:\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.44 trillion Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): $3.16 trillion Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): $3.14 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $2.07 trillion Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.87 trillion Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): $1.33 trillion\n\nAll of these companies are profitable, so they can be valued with the widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It's calculated by dividing the share price of a given company by its earnings per share. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.9, which is a good reference point: NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nNvidia is the most expensive trillion-dollar stock today on a P/E basis. However, the company is growing so quickly it has a forward P/E ratio of just 33.1 based on next year's earnings forecast. In other words, its valuation is much more reasonable if investors are willing to hold it for a couple of years.\n\nThe cheapest stock of the group is Alphabet. A judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, and the U.S. Department of Justice wants to break up the company to resolve that issue. It could take years -- if it happens at all -- but combined with growing competition from artificial intelligence chatbots, which are threatening the dominance of Google Search, investors are treading cautiously with respect to Alphabet's valuation.\n\nFinally, Amazon deserves a mention. It's on track to generate $635 billion in revenue this year, which is more than any of its peers, and it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue). Plus, its earnings are forecast to grow 63% this year and 23% in 2025, so its elevated P/E ratio might actually be justified.\n\nIn summary, a P/E ratio alone isn't always the best indicator of value. Investors could easily make the case that despite trading at triple the P/E ratio, Nvidia stock is a better buy than Alphabet because of its rapid growth (and Alphabet's regulatory headwinds).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Paris Olympics last month - SARAH MEYSSONNIER\n\nGermany’s economic woes have deepened after new figures showed a second straight month of contraction.\n\nS&P Global’s composite PMI showed a reading of 48.5 for Germany in August, down from 49.1 the previous month and below economists’ forecasts.\n\nThe downturn was driven by an ongoing crisis in Germany’s dominant manufacturing sector, which has now been in contraction for more than two years.\n\nBut these troubles have now started to spill over into the services sector, which had otherwise been steady.\n\nIn a further blow, employment in Europe’s largest economy decreased at the fastest rate in four years as firms expressed less optimism towards growth prospects in the coming year.\n\nDr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, branded the numbers a “real mess”.\n\nHe said: “The recession in Germany’s manufacturing sector deepened in August, with no recovery in sight. In fact, new orders took a sharper dive than last month, mainly due to a significant drop in foreign demand, signalling more trouble ahead.\n\n“Given this, it’s hardly surprising that companies are ramping up staff cuts and slashing inventories of inputs even more aggressively than before.”\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:01 PM BST\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today. The Markets blog will be back in the morning, but I’ll leave you with of the top business stories elsewhere on The Telegraph website today:\n\nElon Musk cuts down 500,000 trees at Tesla’s German gigafactory Capital gains raid by Reeves risks costing taxpayer £2bn Ben Marlow: Jet-setting Starbucks boss makes a mockery of the company’s green agenda\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nEuropean stocks rise on rate cut hopes\n\nEurope’s main stock index climbed on Thursday, with healthcare and retail stocks leading the charge, while investors cheered the prospects of interest rate cuts by central banks, despite some nervousness by traders in the US, and sifted through a wave of economic data globally.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4pc higher, rising for the second day and closing at its highest level this month.\n\nThe retail sector was the strongest part of the market, boosted by an 10.7pc jump in JD Sports, after the British sportswear retailer reported an improvement in second-quarter underlying sales growth.\n\nThe healthcare sector hit a record high, in part due to a 2.4pc rise in drug company Novo Nordisk.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\nApple bows to EU regulators over browser choices\n\nApple will change how iPhone and iPad users in the EU choose their web browser, the company said today.\n\nThe iPhone maker came under pressure from regulators to make changes after the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, forcing it to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers on a “choice screen” the first time they open Safari.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an update later this year, Apple users will be able to select a default browser directly from the choice screen after going through a mandatory list of options.\n\nA randomly ordered list of 12 browsers per EU country will be shown to the user with short descriptions, and the chosen one will be automatically downloaded, Apple said.\n\nIt will also add a dedicated section for changing default apps and make more apps deletable.\n\nApple released a previous update in response to the new rules in March, but browser companies criticised the design of its choice screen, and the Commission opened an investigation on March 25 saying it suspected that the measures fell short of effective compliance.\n\nApple said it has been in dialogue with the European Commission and believes the new changes will address regulators’ concerns.

Laurent Freixe takes up the role on September 1 - Edgard Garrido/Reuters\n\n05:21 PM BST\n\n‘Markets are preparing for possible turbulence on Friday’, says analyst\n\nMarkets are “preparing for possible turbulence” tomorrow, an analyst has said, amid uncertain trading in stocks today.\n\nStock markets wobbled this afternoon as investors await a highly-anticipated speech by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, hoping he will drop more clues about an expected interest-rate cut.\n\nThe Dow, the broader S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq had all opened on the right foot, extending gains from the previous day, but faltered later this afternoon.\n\nIn Europe, Paris finished flat while London and Frankfurt were in the green but not as strong as earlier in the day when key surveys showed business activity accelerated in Britain and the eurozone in August.\n\nThe spotlight will turn to Powell on Friday when he addresses an annual gathering of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with investors eager to hear for fresh signals about the Fed’s plans.\n\nIpek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said:\n\nWe can see the mounting tension [heading] into Powell’s speech.\n\nMarkets are preparing for possible turbulence on Friday.\n\n05:13 PM BST\n\nJunior lawyers offered £38,000 referral bonuses in war for talent\n\nJunior lawyers are being offered bonuses of $50,000 (£38,000) for referring their friends for jobs amid a war for talent. Adam Mawardi reports:\n\nUS law firms Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis are paying tens of thousands of pounds to London-based workers as part of the firm’s global policies.\n\nThe bonuses are on top of six-figure salaries paid to junior lawyers, which start at £180,000 at Paul Weiss and £164,000 at Kirkland & Ellis upon qualification.\n\nKirkland & Ellis has extended its $50,000 referral bonus scheme until January 2025, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe Chicago-based firm previously offered incentives of $25,000, but doubled this last October.\n\nLondon’s homegrown law firms are facing renewed pressure from foreign rivals amid a rebound in demand for legal services from last year’s deal-making slump.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n04:55 PM BST\n\nFTSE 100 closes marginally up after afternoon of subdued trading\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed up 0.1pc, having given up some of the gains it made this morning.\n\nJD Sports was the biggest riser, up 10.7pc, followed by Tesco, up 2pc.\n\nAt the other end of the index, Legal & General fell 2.8pc, followed by natural resources company Glencore, down 1.9pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 fell 0.4pc.

The latest home sales came in slightly higher than the 3.92m pace economists were expecting.\n\nLawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist, said:\n\nDespite the modest gain, home sales are still sluggish. But consumers are definitely seeing more choices, and affordability is improving due to lower interest rates.\n\n04:43 PM BST\n\nWall Street falls as traders bet on slower US rate cuts\n\nWall Street shares have fallen during trade this afternoon amid pessimism in the markets of the pace of US interest rate cuts.\n\nSince yesterday, traders have cut their bets on a more than quarter point interest rate cut in September, amid expectations among some commentators that Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, will pour cold water over large and fast rate cuts between now and the end of the year.\n\nIt came as Patrick Harker, the Philadelphia Fed president, told Reuters: “I think a slow, methodical approach down is the right way to go.”\n\nShare prices in Europe and the US have been mostly been subdued this afternoon, but the S&P is down 0.4pc, the Dow Jones is down 0.3pc and the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.8pc.\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nBP shares drop to lowest for two years\n\nShares in BP fell as much as 1.4pc today, reaching their lowest in two years.\n\nHenry Tarr, an analyst at Berenberg, said:\n\nBP pivoted hard toward the energy transition under Bernard Looney around the time of maximum interest in green energy solutions and very low interest rates.\n\nSince then commodity prices have recovered, making the legacy upstream business seem more attractive, while higher interest rates and more competition has left some low-carbon businesses looking less attractive.\n\nWill Hares, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said:\n\nCompared to its No. 1 peer, Shell, there’s an increasing concern of sustainability of returns. The market wants to see more of a commitment to essentially their cash engines, which are oil and gas.\n\nIn June, The Telegraph reported that BP has put all new offshore wind projects on pause as its new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, sought to focus more heavily on fossil fuels.\n\n04:25 PM BST\n\nEuro zone bond yields edge up after strong survey data\n\nEuro zone bond yields were rose today after survey data showed the bloc’s services sector fared better than expected in August.\n\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, was at 2.245pc, up from 2.194pc yesterday.\n\nPurchasing managers’ index (PMI) survey data showed euro zone business activity was surprisingly strong in August, with services a bright spot.\n\nGermany remained mired in a downturn, however. Its PMI showed business activity contracted in August for a second consecutive month and by more than expected.\n\nSeparate figures showed growth in negotiated wages in the euro zone slowed sharply to 3.55pc year-on-year in the second quarter, down from a record high of 4.74pc in the first quarter.\n\nJussi Hiljanen, head of European rates strategy at financial services group SEB, said:\n\nThe PMI figures are overshadowing these wage numbers. The service sector is still strong and service sector inflation is one of the focal points of the ECB [European Central Bank].\n\n04:08 PM BST\n\nUK and US stock markets flat despite Japanese jump\n\nMajor stock market indexes in the UK and America are mostly not far from being flat currently, with earlier gains tailing off. However, on the continent, the Dax is up 0.3pc and the pan-European Stoxx 600 is up 0.4pc.\n\nAxel Rudolph, senior technical analyst at online trading platform IG, said:\n\nThe .... rally in the Japanese Nikkei 225 hasn’t been replicated by any US, nor European equity indices, which continue to trade in low volume and volatility ahead of Fed chair Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday.\n\n03:51 PM BST\n\nTraders are pricing in too many US rate cuts, says former Pimco boss\n\nTraders are “overdoing” their bets on US interest rate cuts, the former boss of investment management firm Pimco has said.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, the president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, told Bloomberg Television:\n\nIt is problematic in my mind that the market is pricing in so many rate cuts right now. The market is overdoing it.\n\n03:46 PM BST\n\nJD Sports shares surge 8.2pc as Americans drive sales\n\nJD Sports shares are the strongest performers among the FTSE 100 today, rising 8.2pc after reporting growing sales.\n\nThe high street retailer said its total sales grew 2.4pc over the three months to August, compared with the same period a year ago, and on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of new store openings.\n\nThis was driven by growth in North America and Europe, whereas sales in the UK slipped 0.8pc year on year, the group said.\n\nIt flagged a decline in earnings generated from clothing and online sales, which particularly dragged on the UK.\n\nChief executive Regis Schultz stressed that there continues to be demand for new trainers among its younger demographic of shoppers. He said:\n\nThe trend around sneakers and more relaxed apparel continues.\n\nThere is a little bit of movement around brands, with some seeing some innovation, but I think we see strong appetite from the consumer and especially the young customer ... and that is what we are benefiting from.\n\nNike is still “by far the number one” brand, while there is “still some room to go for Adidas to catch up”, Mr Schultz said.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said:\n\nPerhaps the most exciting and obvious opportunity in the medium term is JD’s growing brand presence in the major US market. There is 'still some room to go for Adidas to catch up', said JD Sports boss Regis Schultz - Lisi Niesner/Reuters\n\n03:32 PM BST\n\nStock markets buoyed by US rate cut hopes\n\nStock markets are mostly up today on growing optimism that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.\n\nWall Street got off on the right foot at the open, adding to the previous day’s gains, although they are currently roughly flat compared with the open.\n\nLondon, Paris and Frankfurt are up in afternoon deals after Tokyo and Hong Kong finished higher.\n\nThe dollar has been under pressure from expectations of lower rates, though it pared down some losses against the euro and the yen today.\n\nInvestor confidence in a rate cut grew after minutes from the Fed’s July policy meeting, released last night, showed that most members believed that it would be “appropriate” to lower borrowing costs in September.\n\nTraders were also buoyed by official figures showing that US employers added around 68,000 fewer jobs monthly in the year to March than initially estimated.\n\nA softer US labour market, along with cooling inflation, gives the central bank room to start reducing rates that were brought to a 23-year high in order to bring down soaring consumer prices.\n\nThe markets are now eagerly anticipating a speech by Fed chief Jerome Powell at an annual gathering of global central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday for more signs that a cut is imminent.

That compares to economists’ forecasts of 230,000 claims.\n\nHowever, the figures should help to ease concerns of a downturn in the US job market after a surprise slump in job gains last month.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will have a keen eye on the figures as they consider whether to start cutting interest rates in September.\n\n01:28 PM BST\n\nTravelodge suffers ‘softer’ demand despite Taylor Swift boost\n\nTravelodge has reported “softer” demand for its hotel rooms in London despite a boost from Taylor Swift’s Eras tour.\n\nThe budget hotel chain said it enjoyed strong trading close to the popstar’s Wembley concerts and around major sporting events.\n\nBut there was lower demand during Wimbledon and fewer midweek leisure visitors to the capital due to poor weather.\n\nThe downturn was offset by strong regional demand for hotel rooms, with bosses hailing “encouraging trends” for staycations in the UK in June.\n\nOverall, revenue was up 1.7pc to £486.7m for the first six months of 2024, compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nJo Boydell, chief executive of Travelodge, said:\n\nThe UK regions have been really solid this year but London has been impacted by a lower event schedule year-on-year.\n\nFor the bigger events we have had, such as Taylor Swift and big sporting events, we have performed really well. The return of the football season has been really good as well, with that supporting a lot of regional hotels.\n\n12:52 PM BST\n\nPeloton grows revenue as turnaround starts to pay off Peloton\n\nPeloton has posted better-than-expected revenue and profits in its latest quarter in a sign the struggling fitness firm’s turnaround plan is starting to bear fruit.\n\nThe New York-based company, which makes interactive exercise equipment, posted sales of $644m (£491m) in the three months to the end of June.\n\nThat was up less than 1pc from a year earlier, but was comfortably ahead of Wall Street’s forecasts.\n\nPeloton also said it was “especially proud” of its move towards profitability. Adjusted earnings were $70.3m, compared to a loss of $34.7m a year earlier.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, the company said: “We’ll continue to optimise our expenses. Our improvement in profitability reflects our continued focus on aligning our costs with the size of our business.”\n\n12:32 PM BST\n\nHow airports became a battleground for a looming Labour revolt Heathrow Airport - Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nHeathrow and Gatwick expansion plans risk a Labour backbench rebellion, reports our transport industry editor Christopher Jasper:\n\nWhen Labour announced this week that it would back the expansion of London City airport against the wishes of local party members, the decision reverberated far beyond east London.\n\nBy riding roughshod over Newham council’s bid to block thousands of additional flights, Labour put down a marker in the first significant test of its stance on controversial infrastructure projects likely to boost GDP but have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe decision to lift London City’s annual capacity by 2.5m passengers, or almost 40pc, gave substance to Labour’s pledge to make economic growth its key policy driver.\n\nIn doing so, it also bolstered the view that the party leadership may be willing to lock horns with its own MPs when it comes to one of Britain’s fiercest infrastructure debates – that is the construction of new runways at Heathrow and Gatwick.\n\nRead his full story here.\n\n11:48 AM BST\n\nElon Musk cuts down 500,000 trees at Tesla’s German gigafactory\n\nElon Musk’s Tesla felled half a million trees in order to build his giant Berlin electric car factory, satellite analysis shows.\n\nHere’s Matt Field with more:\n\nImaging from environmental intelligence firm Kayrros suggested around 329 hectares of local woodland were felled between March 2020 and May 2023 to expand the plant. This is equivalent to around 500,000 trees.\n\nWork on the plant, which has capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles each year, began in 2020 and it officially opened in 2022. It is Tesla’s only so-called “gigafactory” in Europe.\n\nThe extent to which Tesla has altered the local environment, according to satellite images shared with the Guardian, is likely to reignite controversy surrounding the factory.\n\nRead the full story here\n\n11:25 AM BST\n\nReaction: German numbers are a ‘real mess’\n\nDr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, offers a damning assessment of Germany’s PMI numbers:\n\nThese numbers are a real mess. The recession in Germany’s manufacturing sector deepened in August, with no recovery in sight. In fact, new orders took a sharper dive than last month, mainly due to a significant drop in foreign demand, signalling more trouble ahead. Given this, it’s hardly surprising that companies are ramping up staff cuts and slashing inventories of inputs even more aggressively than before.\n\nThe struggles in manufacturing are starting to spill over into the otherwise steady services sector. For the third month in a row, services activity growth has slowed down. New business is barely growing, and backlogs declined once again. The export side of services, including tourism, isn’t offering much support either, shrinking at an even faster rate than in July.\n\nThe anticipated recovery in the second half of the year is failing to take shape. There were good reasons to be hopeful — lower inflation and higher wages seemed like the perfect recipe for increased consumption. Plus, global industry had started to bounce back, something Germany typically benefits from. But it appears that uncertainty around economic policy has put a damper on consumer spending, while the global manufacturing upswing turned sour before German companies could feel the boost. Instead, the odds of a second straight quarter of negative growth have gone up, meaning we might be back to talking about a recession in Germany soon.\n\nAfter such a prolonged slump that began in mid-2022, the renewed optimism among manufacturers seen earlier this year is fading fast. Manufacturers’ expectations towards future output have now been below the long-term average for two consecutive months, mirroring the continuous decline in outstanding orders, which have been shrinking for an uninterrupted 27 months. The anticipated interest rate cuts by the ECB, expected by most analysts, might lift spirits a little, but it’s clear that the overall mood remains poor.\n\n11:23 AM BST\n\nGerman economic gloom deepens as France gets Olympics boost\n\nGermany’s economic woes deepened this month, while France enjoyed its fastest growth in two years as visitors flocked to Paris for the Olympic Games.\n\nS&P Global’s composite PMI came in at 48.5 for Germany in August, below economists’ expectations and the second month of contraction.\n\nIt is the latest sign that the recovery in Europe’s largest economy has dried up after GDP unexpectedly fell 0.1pc in the second quarter.\n\nIndustry remains the main drag on Germany’s economy, with the PMI stuck in contraction since July 2022.\n\nBy contrast, the French PMI surged to 55 in August from 50.1 in July - well above forecasts. Still, the Olympics boost may not last long, with a broader slowdown predicted across Europe towards the end of the year.\n\n🇩🇪 August PMI: Germany is diving deeper and deeper into the abyss...

She also extended the windfall tax until 2030 and abolished tax incentives for further investment.\n\nThe letter, coordinated by the industry trade body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), said the plans “would be a blunt response which could undermine the levers to long-term solutions and jeopardise jobs in communities across the UK”.\n\nIt added: “For our companies, this surprise risks operators – big and small – further scaling back or postponing their investment plans in response.”\n\nRead the full story here\n\n09:59 AM BST\n\nM&S in heated talks to remove ultra-processed ingredients from sandwiches and ready meals M&S food ultra-processed\n\nMarks & Spencer is pushing to remove additives from its ready meals and sandwiches amid an outcry over so-called ultra-processed foods (UPFs).\n\nDaniel Woolfson has the story:\n\nThe supermarket is in heated discussions with food manufacturers in an effort to get rid of ingredients such as stabilisers, acidity regulators, antioxidants and emulsifiers from products sold under M&S’s Eat Well label, according to The Grocer.\n\nSuch additives have long been common in supermarket products but have attracted fierce criticism recently over concerns they could be negatively impacting people’s health.\n\nFears have risen up the agenda since the publication of Dr Chris van Tulleken’s best-seller Ultra-Processed People last year.\n\nRead Daniel’s full story here\n\n09:41 AM BST\n\nUK business activity accelerates in boost for economy\n\nUK private sector companies have reported their strongest growth in four months while inflation has eased in a boost for both the Bank of England and the Government.\n\nS&P Global’s composite PMI rose to 53.4 in August, up from 52.8 the previous month. That was slightly above the figure of 53 forecast by economists.\n\nAt the same time, inflation relating to companies’ costs eased to the lowest since the start of 2021, thanks largely to cooling price pressures in the services sector.\n\nThe numbers suggest that economic growth is not fuelling inflation. That’s a boost for the Bank of England, which cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years earlier this month.\n\nIt will also help Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which is relying on strong growth to help fund investment in public services.\n\n09:24 AM BST\n\nWhy Reeves’ relationship with the unions is a threat to Britain’s public finances\n\nICYMI - Eir Nolsoe and Tim Wallace examine how a wave of public sector pay rises risk fuelling overspending:\n\nRachel Reeves was clear only weeks into her term as Chancellor: there would be tough choices ahead.\n\nShe has since doled out £9.4bn on inflation-busting pay rises for public sector workers including teachers, doctors and paramedics.\n\nThe Government offered train drivers’ union Aslef a 14pc pay rise over three years, only for it to be followed by fresh strike announcements over a separate dispute.\n\nOfficial data published on Wednesday underlined just how difficult it will be to balance the books.\n\nRead the full story here\n\n09:05 AM BST\n\nFTSE risers and fallers\n\nThe FTSE 100 has edged higher this morning on growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates next month.\n\nThe blue-chip index was up 0.3pc in early trading, though the domestically-focused FTSE 250 dipped after logging its best day in more than a week on Wednesday.\n\nJD Sports was the biggest riser, up more than 3pc after reporting a rise in sales amid its expansion plan.

But while the discounts can look impressive, many shoppers are growing suspicious of non-member prices that seem high.\n\nWe looked at the pricing history of thousands of products and found that, while the majority of discounts were not misleading, there were some questionable non-member prices and some examples that looked like an outright rip-off. Meanwhile some products were always, or almost always, on loyalty promotion, making it difficult to spot a genuine deal.\n\nGuidance on pricing laws needs to be updated to include loyalty pricing, to help  regulators crack down if businesses break the rules. The CMA should continue to monitor loyalty pricing practices across key consumer sectors and be ready to use its new powers to take action against retailers that don’t comply.\n\n07:40 AM BST\n\nJD Sports bags sales boost amid expansion plan JD Sports expansion plan\n\nJD Sports has posted a rise in sales after opening 85 new stores this year as part of a major expansion plan.\n\nThe high street retailer reported a 2.4pc rise in total sales in the three months to August, driven mainly by growth in Europe and North America.\n\nJD cited its “multi-brand” model for its success, as well as a weaker performance last year.\n\nHowever, UK sales slipped 0.8pc as bosses warned that the global economic environment “remains volatile”.\n\nThe chain opened 85 new JD shops over the first half of the year which, along with acquiring American sports brand Hibbett, gave it with more than 4,500 stores by August.\n\n07:34 AM BST\n\n5 things to start your day\n\n1) Why Reeves’ relationship with the unions is a threat to Britain’s public finances - A wave of public sector pay rises risk fuelling overspending\n\n2) Waitrose plots 100 convenience stores in £1bn push to win back shoppers from M&S - Retailer also plans to refurbish 150 shops to include hatches for Deliveroo orders\n\n3) Volkswagen attacks EU over ‘incomprehensible’ electric car tariffs - Porsche owner faces higher import taxes than Chinese rivals\n\n4) M&S pushes to remove ultra-processed ingredients from ‘healthy’ products - Supermarket battles to maintain Eat Well label’s reputation amid outcry over additives\n\n5) Tom Stevenson: The real reason for the recent market turmoil - We risk being drowned in our puny attempts to swim against the tide of passive money\n\nWhat happened overnight\n\nEuropean stocks were set for a breather as sentiment cools ahead of key events from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan.\n\nEuro Stoxx 50 futures were little changed along with contracts for US equities.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index pared a 0.4pc advance as benchmarks in Japan and Hong Kong came off session highs.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Apple will change how users choose browser options in the European Union, add a dedicated section for changing default apps, and make more apps deletable, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe iPhone maker came under pressure from regulators to make changes after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers on a \"choice screen\".\n\nThe new rules require mobile software makers to show the choice screen where users can select a browser, search engine and virtual assistant as they set up their phones, which earlier came with preferred options from Apple and Google.\n\nIn an update later this year, Apple users will be able to select a default browser directly from the choice screen after going through a mandatory list of options.\n\nA randomly ordered list of 12 browsers per EU country will be shown to the user with short descriptions, and the chosen one will be automatically downloaded, Apple said. The choice screen will also be available on iPads through an update later this year.\n\nApple released a previous update in response to the new rules in March, but browser companies criticized the design of its choice screen, and the Commission opened an investigation on March 25 saying it suspected that the measures fell short of effective compliance.\n\nThe company said it has been in dialogue with the European Commission and believes the new changes will address regulators' concerns.\n\nIt also plans to introduce a dedicated area for default apps where a user will be able to set defaults for messaging, phone calls, spam filters, password managers and keyboards.\n\nUsers will also be able to delete certain Apple-made apps such as App Store, Messages, Camera, Photos and Safari. Only Settings and Phone apps would not be deletable.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Help Make You a Fortune",
        "content": "If you follow tech or stock market news even slightly, you're probably growing tired of reading about artificial intelligence (AI). The technology has been featured in countless headlines since the start of 2023, after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The advanced chatbot reignited interest in AI, highlighted its potential to improve many industries, and motivated companies across tech to pivot their business toward the budding market.\n\nHowever, whether you've come down with AI fatigue or not, it remains hard to deny the potentially lucrative opportunity that investing in AI presents. Despite massive investment over the last year, the market is still in its infancy. The generative technology is being applied to many industries, such as healthcare, education, consumer tech, cloud computing, productivity software, and much more. In all likelihood, the best use of AI hasn't even been thought of yet.\n\nConsequently, AI likely still has plenty to offer companies and new investors. So, here are two artificial intelligence stocks that could help make you a fortune.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nDespite years of success in the chip market, the boom in AI seemed to catch Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) off guard. Last year, a surge in demand for AI models triggered a similar increase in demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), the high-performance chips that make AI possible.\n\nAMD is no stranger to the GPU industry, holding the second-largest market share (after Nvidia) in desktop GPUs for years. Yet, Nvidia managed to get a head start by immediately supplying its GPUs to AI developers in 2023, while AMD took time to catch up.\n\nFor years, AMD's primary focus has been central processing units (CPUs), where the company has achieved record heights. AMD has consistently stolen CPU market share from Intel since 2017, with its share rising from 20% to 34%.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD's business has proven far more efficient than Intel's. Intel boasts a 76% market share in data center CPUs, which saw it earn $3 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Yet, AMD achieved $2.8 billion from its server CPU business in the same period, with only 24% of the market.\n\nAnd now AMD is making promising headway in AI GPUs. In 2024, the company launched new GPUs to better compete with Nvidia, welcoming Microsoft's Azure, Meta Platforms, and Oracle as customers. The AI expansion is already paying off, with AMD's data center segment posting a 115% rise in revenue in Q2 2024, a record for the chipmaker.\n\nAMD's stock is up more than 376% in the last five years but could rise much higher over the next half-decade thanks to AI. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high at 44. However, that figure is also below its 12-month average for the metric. Given its significant potential in AI, AMD is worth considering right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has taken a more reserved approach to AI than many of its peers. As companies like Microsoft and Alphabet pushed full force into the industry in 2023, Apple is only now gearing up to launch its most significant AI product yet. However, its potent brand and vast cash reserves could allow it to quickly gain a powerful role in the industry.\n\nThis fall, the tech giant will debut Apple Intelligence, its name for a wave of AI updates to its product lineup. The software overhaul will bring language, image, and audio generation features to its iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Apple Intelligence's release will follow the launch of the iPhone 16 in September, the company's first smartphone designed with AI in mind.\n\nApple has made Apple Intelligence only available to its newer and more powerful devices. As a result, iPhone users will need an iPhone 15 Pro or higher to access the new AI features. Meanwhile, Macs and iPads will require M1 through M4 chips.\n\nApple has experienced repeated declines in its product segments over the last year amid general weak consumer spending power and decreased market share in crucial markets like China. However, earnings results for the fiscal third quarter of 2024, ended June 29, suggest new AI-focused product releases could work to bolster sales.\n\nRevenue increased 5% year over year during the quarter. The period was boosted by a 24% rise in iPad sales thanks to the launch of new iPad Air and Pro models in May, the first new iPad releases since 2022. As a result, a similar revamp to its other products could further boost sales in the coming months, especially with AI as a factor.\n\nCompetitors like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have mainly focused on the business side of AI. However, Apple's priority of getting AI into the hands of consumers could go a long way in securing a powerful position in the industry.\n\nApple's forward P/E is high at 34. However, with $104 billion in free cash flow and a potent brand, Apple's stock remains an attractive way to invest in AI and one that could make you a fortune.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘Too Good To Let Go’",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500’s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I’m telling you, it’s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\n\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance—with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%—the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn’t as favorable. We’re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\n\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\n\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\n\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer addressed concerns about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock being expensive, suggesting that its strong cash flow justifies the price, rather than just focusing on earnings. He referenced an insightful piece by Ben Rice from Melius, which reinforced the idea of holding onto Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) despite current market signals to sell.\n\n\"Another firm mentioned that Apple’s stock is expensive, which it is—unless you consider the cash flow instead of just the earnings. The piece by the irrepressible Ben Rice from Melius made so much sense that you know you need to hold on tight and not feel compelled to sell your Apple stock when the market gets overbought, as it is now. The tech titans, the hyperscalers, the colossal portion of the market—yes, the mega stocks—they just come back every time you sell. But short-term signals say to sell. To me, that means it’s time to bunker down and accept the unavoidable small losses. These stocks are just too good to let go. Bottom line: Hold on to them.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s wide-ranging ecosystem, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and services like iCloud and Apple Music, creates a loyal and interconnected customer base. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) consistently grows its revenue due to high demand for its flagship products, particularly the iPhone, and increasing sales in its services segment. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s dedication to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks enhances its investment appeal.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads in technology innovation, with recent product releases such as the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9, which feature advanced camera systems and longer battery life. Strategic investments, including acquiring MLB's Apple TV+ rights and the virtual reality content provider NextVR, position Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to enter new markets and sustain its growth.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top bullish stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s head of the App Store is leaving as part of a reorganization of the lucrative division, which has drawn regulatory scrutiny over concerns it wields too much power in the mobile software market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Serious Work That Free Play Can Do\n\nMatt Fischer, a vice president who has run the App Store business since 2010, is leaving the iPhone maker in October, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because the changes haven’t been announced. The App Store group is being split into two teams: one overseeing Apple’s own store and another responsible for alternative app distribution.\n\nPhil Schiller, the executive who is ultimately responsible for the App Store, is making the changes in response to regulators forcing Apple to allow alternative stores and payment methods for apps on the iPhone, iPad and the company’s other devices.\n\n“After 21 years at Apple, I’ve made the decision to step away from our incredible company,” Fischer told his team in an email Wednesday. “This has been on my mind for some time, and as we are also reorganizing the team to better manage new challenges and opportunities, now is the right moment to pass the baton to two outstanding leaders on my team.”\n\nCarson Oliver, a longtime senior director, will run the App Store group, while Ann Thai, a director in charge of App Store features like search and discovery, will lead the new team responsible for alternative distribution. Both managers will report to Schiller.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple’s App Store business has been under pressure from developers and regulators for the past several years. Earlier in 2024, the company had to revamp its operations to conform with new laws from the EU. Apple recently changed its commission structure in the EU and opened up its devices to third-party marketplaces.\n\nBut some developers and the EU have complained that Apple’s changes don’t go far enough. They note that the company, in some cases, is still looking to collect fees for apps and subscriptions sold on its platforms — even within third-party stores. The changes in the EU, along with possible shifts in other regions, have jeopardized the App Store’s role as a growth engine for Apple.\n\nThe business generates about $20 billion in revenue per year as part of Apple’s services segment. Services have become especially critical for Apple in recent years, since growth of its main hardware products, including the iPhone, has stalled.\n\nIn addition to overseeing App Stores for all of Apple’s devices, Fischer has run the company’s Arcade service, a gaming platform that launched in 2019.\n\nStory continues\n\nSchiller, meanwhile, was named an Apple Fellow in 2020, when he stepped down from his role as marketing chief. He also remains in charge of Apple’s product launch events.\n\n(Updates with context on new app regulations starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nFox News Embraces a Different Kind of Guest: Democrats ‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport Where All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes The Little-Known Company That Caught Basketball’s Big Betting Scandal Musk Gets the Warlord Seal of Approval for the Cybertruck\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recommends These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Jim Cramer.\n\nIn a recent episode of Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer discussed how global markets have become more interconnected than ever. He compared this to 1987, when Japan's influence on U.S. stocks was clear, with Japanese investors driving up prices in sectors like waste management and railroads. This connection between markets was strong then, and it's even stronger now.\n\n\"Obviously, we went down on Japan, and we went up on Japan. This is somewhat reminiscent of 1987, when, if Japan was up, they’d come over and flood our markets. Sometimes they didn’t care; they’d just start buying stocks, often starting with waste management and Browning-Ferris. \"\n\nCramer explained that the weakening dollar further enhances this global link, benefiting companies that sell internationally, such as Coca-Cola. He also observed a significant shift in investor behavior—where people once looked for reasons to stay out of the market, they now seem more inclined to stay in, finding optimism even in bad news. This change in attitude mirrors today's market environment, where good news lifts stocks, and even bad news is met with hope for a recovery.\n\n\"Back in the day, you’d wonder why Browning-Ferris was up, and the answer would be, 'Large buyer, large buyer, large buyer.' Eventually, you’d go out for a beer, and it turns out it’s Tokyo. They loved the rails. There was such craziness back then, but now, we’re even more linked. And with the dollar continuing to weaken, it’s good that we’re linked for companies like that.\"\n\nJim Cramer noted the irony of discussing September as a traditionally bad month for the market. He pointed out that when people focus too much on a specific month being negative, it often doesn’t turn out that way. Cramer also mentioned that despite this expectation, the market had been up significantly, making last week’s market behavior seem unusual.\n\n\"Well, it’s funny. You talked about September being a bad month last week, so maybe we get there in a roundabout way. I know that when you single out a month, that’s often when it doesn’t happen. But I also know that we’re up big, and last week seemed odd.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Squawk on the Street and his post on the key things to watch in the stock market for Monday. We selected ten stocks that he mentioned and included information on hedge fund sentiment for each. The stocks are ranked by the number of hedge funds that own them, from lowest to highest.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 184\n\nJim Cramer reports that MoffettNathanson has begun coverage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a hold-equivalent rating and a price target of $211 per share. Cramer believes that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s AI initiatives will lead to a significant iPhone upgrade cycle. In his view, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has always been a stock to own for the long term rather than trade frequently.\n\n\"MoffettNathanson started coverage of Apple with a hold-equivalent rating and price target of $211 a share. Analysts deep-dived the iPhone maker’s AI strategy and said they are largely positive on it, but believe the stock’s current valuation is factoring that in already. I’m a believer that Apple’s AI initiatives will spark a significant iPhone upgrade cycle. Apple has long been an “own it, don’t trade it” stock in my eyes.\"\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track for ongoing growth due to its globally recognized brand and valuable ecosystem, which includes iOS, macOS, watchOS, and a range of services. This ecosystem creates a smooth user experience that strengthens customer loyalty. The services segment, featuring the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, has become a major revenue driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads in product innovation with updates to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and wearables. Its strong global presence and ability to adapt to different markets ensure continued growth, with expanding opportunities in regions like China and India adding to its positive outlook. Additionally, the wearables segment, particularly the Apple Watch, has seen significant growth thanks to its popularity in health and fitness, boosting sales and revenue.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Evidence of food price gouging is hard to find",
        "content": "It’s easy to see food inflation on store shelves. It’s a lot harder figuring out who or what caused it.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban “price gouging” in the food industry to address the food inflation that has been the scourge of the economy for the last three years. Grocery prices are up 21% since Joe Biden entered the White House in 2021. Wages are up only 17%. Shoppers are losing ground on their grocery budgets.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was president, food prices only rose by 6.5%, while wages rose 15%. That’s one big reason some voters give Trump an edge on his handling of the economy. Food and rent inflation helped drive Biden’s approval rating below 40%, one of the reasons he withdrew from the presidential race in July.\n\nHarris obviously wants to reverse that negative vibe. But pinpointing a villain responsible for high food prices is not going to be the way to do it. To hunt for price gouging in the food industry, Yahoo Finance looked at profit and cost data in eight different sectors that represent the entire food industry, including agriculture, food production, distribution, and retail. This includes big names everybody has heard of, such as Walmart, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble, plus many of their competitors.\n\nWe used standard industry classification codes to gather data on eight sectors of the food industry, using Dow Jones ticker symbols for each sector and S&P Capital IQ to gather the data. Each ticker symbol represents a subset of publicly owned companies that belong to the S&P 500 index. So the profit and cost data we analyzed represents an aggregation of data for all the companies represented by each ticker symbol.\n\nWe compared average costs and profits from 2016 to 2019 with the same data from 2022 through 2024. The first period represents the pre-COVID economy, when inflation was low, while the second represents the post-COVID economy, when inflation was high.\n\nPrice gouging would be evident if profits went up by a lot more than costs during the last few years. That would reveal companies raising prices more than necessary to cover their own higher costs and making more money as a result.\n\nWe found little of that, however. Of the eight categories we looked at, profits grew by more than costs in only three of them. That suggests firms in those categories were passing on their own higher costs to consumers, plus a little bit more. But in the other five industries, companies seemed to be eating higher costs instead of passing them along.\n\nStory continues\n\nDrop Rick Newman a note, follow him on X, or sign up for his newsletter.\n\nThe biggest profit gain, relative to costs, has come deep in the food supply chain where most consumers would never notice. In the agriculture products and service sectors, post-COVID profits rose by 129%, while costs rose by just 75%. That means this industry is more profitable now than it was during the four years prior to COVID.\n\nThe biggest company in this sector is ADM, formerly known as Archer Daniels Midland, which processes agricultural commodities such as corn, stores and transports grain, and produces a variety of food additives, along with ethanol. ADM did become more profitable during recent years. From 2016 through 2019, its profit margin averaged 2.4%. That rose to 4.3% in 2022, when food inflation hit 12%. In earnings calls, executives explained how newfound “pricing power” was helping boost earnings.\n\nDoes that amount to “price gouging?” Meh. Companies, especially public ones, have a legal obligation to their shareholders to maximize profitability. Companies raise prices whenever they can get away with it. It’s the government’s job to figure out if companies are exploiting monopoly power or other unfair advantages. And ADM’s 4.3% profit margin hardly seems excessive compared with a company like Apple, which has a 26% margin.\n\nAt any rate, ADM’s profit margin is now drifting back down, and in its latest earnings call, executives discussed the challenges of lower, not higher, pricing. We've reached out to ADM for comment and will update this story if the company responds.\n\nThe only other sector with a meaningful increase in profitability in recent years was consumer staples retailers, which include Walmart, Costco, Target, and other chain stores. Post-COVID profits in this sector were up 67%, while costs were up 51%. That doesn’t seem like enough of a gap to constitute price-gouging. Such improved performance could come from efficiency gains as companies facing a surge in wholesale costs work harder to streamline operations. Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appear at the Fiserv Forum during a campaign rally in Milwaukee, Tuesday, Aug. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe only other sector that's more profitable post-COVID is household and personal products, representing companies such as Procter & Gamble. But profits exceed costs by just 1 percentage point, which is basically a wash.\n\nThere are notable instances of food companies becoming less profitable. Restaurants are a standout. Post-COVID profits in this sector are up 8% while costs are up 50%. When McDonald’s, Chipotle, Starbucks, and other chains say they’re doing their best to limit price hikes, they have data backing them up. Other sectors representing companies such as Philip Morris, Mondelez, Kraft Heinz, and Coca-Cola also show declining profitability.\n\nIf companies aren’t price gouging, then what does explain high food inflation? It’s no single thing, but a number of factors consumers have been hearing about during the last several years.\n\nA big one is labor costs. Strong economic growth and a shortage of workers in some areas have pushed labor costs to the highest levels in years. From 2010 through 2019, total compensation costs rose by 2.2% per year, on average. Since 2022, the average increase has been 4.6%. When pay goes up, it usually stays up, which is one reason some inflation — including food inflation — is “sticky.” The good news is that rising labor costs fatten workers’ paychecks.\n\nRead more: Cell phones, TVs, used cars: Here's where prices are easing up as inflation cools\n\nLike ordinary drivers, the food industry has also dealt with higher fuel costs, due in part to disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That raised transportation and production costs. Fertilizer prices spiked due to global shortages and are still elevated. Supply chain disruptions dating to COVID were another factor.\n\nBiden has actually done about as much as a president can to address the root causes of inflation, including the emergency release of oil in 2022 to help lower energy prices and creating a variety of task forces to unclog ports and ameliorate other disruptions. If rapacious greed mongers were ravaging family grocery budgets, we’d probably know who they are by now. Yet the search for villains seems likely to continue until the problem is forgotten.\n\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google’s best bet to hold on to its search market share might be an ad campaign",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is staring down what could be the biggest threat to its search and advertising business after a US court ruled the company operates as an illegal monopoly. Google will appeal the decision, but if the tech giant fails to overturn it, Judge Amit Mehta could require the company to give up its distribution deals with smartphone makers Apple and Samsung.\n\nGoogle currently pays Apple (AAPL) and Samsung billions of dollars to make Google Search the default search engine on its devices. In exchange, Google gets its search platform in front of hundreds of millions of users around the world.\n\nAccess to a massive trove of data enables Google to sell targeted ads against the users that power its enormous advertising empire. If Mehta kills those deals, Google risks losing those users and their precious data.\n\nAnd if Google loses access to the data that powers its dominant position in the ad market, the company may need to return to advertising itself.\n\n“I think that they would start a campaign that would advocate for people to choose Google,” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “I think that they would save $25 billion. And I think the biggest potential loser in the whole conversation is Samsung and Apple.\"\n\nGoogle’s distribution agreements cost billions\n\nAccording to information provided via Mehta’s ruling, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to make its Google Search the default search option on its various devices. That’s double what the company paid the iPhone maker in 2020. Samsung, meanwhile, took home $8 billion over 4 years as part of Google’s exclusivity deals, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIf Google is forced to abandon those agreements, it would immediately begin saving on its traffic acquisition costs (TAC), money it pays out via agreements like those it has with Apple and Samsung, among others. Google paid out $50.8 billion in TAC in 2023, up from $48.9 billion in 2022 and $45.5 billion in 2021.\n\nBut there’s a potential downside to that. Audience members gather at Made By Google for new product announcements at Google on Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2024, in Mountain View, Calif. (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAccording to Mehta’s ruling, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple’s iOS devices if its search engine was replaced as the default search option.\n\nLosing that search volume would cut $28 billion to $32 billion from the company’s bottom line. In 2020, Google brought in $182.5 billion in total revenue. That means if Google lost that iOS traffic it could see revenue drop 15% to 17%.\n\nFor Apple, though, the story could be even more challenging.\n\nLosing $20 billion per year would put a dent in the company’s bottom line, slicing off as much as 25% of Apple’s Services revenue as of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, which puts the Google agreement at about 5% of the company’s revenue for that year.\n\nSamsung wouldn’t take as big of a hit if it lost out on Google’s payments, with $8 billion paid out to the company over four years, or roughly 1% of the company’s total 2023 revenue of $194 billion.\n\nBut losing that traffic and revenue is far from a certainty.\n\nThe European Union’s antitrust enforcer, the European Commission, currently requires Apple and Android device makers to offer European users special choice screens that allow them to choose their default web browsers and search engines as part of a piece of legislation called the Digital Markets Act.\n\nGoogle has been offering the option since March 2024, and according to Statcounter, the company’s search engine market share fell from 96.08% in March to 95.82% in June before rising again to 95.97% in July.\n\nSo what happens if Google is forced to provide similar choice screens in the US?\n\n“I think Google would be focused … on more advertising of ‘We’re such a wonderful search engine’ and ‘Look how easy it is to install us, even if something else has been installed on your recently purchased device as a default,’ ” explained NYU Stern School of Business economics professor Lawrence White. “I can imagine lots more of that kind of advertising.”\n\nAfter all, the company is easily the most recognizable name in the search business and its product has become a verb — people Google information on the web; no one is Binging it.

        "content": "As Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s highly anticipated earnings report approaches, Northland Capital Markets has offered insights into the semiconductor landscape, particularly in relation to the AI trade.\n\nWhile the firm remains cautious about the broader semiconductor sector due to potential volatility stemming from Nvidia's guidance, they have identified six stocks that could present buying opportunities.\n\nNorthland Capital Markets believes Nvidia will likely surpass consensus expectations, driven by robust demand for its products.\n\nHowever, the firm's analysts express concern that the company's guidance might not be strong enough to sustain its momentum.\n\n\"NVDA's breakout quarter was a year ago, with revenues increasing by 88%,\" they wrote. \"Y/Y comps are becoming increasingly difficult moving forward.\"\n\nThis caution stems from Nvidia's ongoing product transition and rising competition in the AI space, which could impact its future performance.\n\nDespite these concerns, Northland recommends looking for opportunities to buy certain semiconductor stocks that could benefit regardless of Nvidia's short-term outlook. Specifically, they highlight AMBA, AIP, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), CEVA, PWR, and PDFS as attractive picks heading into Nvidia's earnings report.\n\nThese companies are seen to be poised to benefit from various trends in the semiconductor and AI markets.\n\nThe report also underscores the competitive dynamics in the AI sector, particularly between Nvidia and AMD.\n\n\"AMD and NVDA are on different commercialization paths,\" Northland notes, drawing a parallel to the historical rivalry between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They expect Nvidia's market share in AI infrastructure to erode over time as alternatives gain traction.\n\nWhile Nvidia's earnings could introduce volatility, Northland Capital Markets sees potential in these six semiconductor stocks, making them attractive buys ahead of the report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuy these six semis stocks going into Nvidia earnings\n\nWill Buffett's 'put' on oil firm Occidental halt share drop?\n\nTJ Maxx parent raises annual profit forecast after strong second quarter\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Baron Opportunity Fund Reinitiated a Position in Apple (AAPL) in Q2",
        "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Opportunity Fund” second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund rose 4.35% (Institutional Shares), lagged the Russell 3000 Growth Index, which gained 7.80%, and essentially matched the S&P 500 Index, which advanced 4.28%. In the first half of 2024, the fund posted solid gains, rising 20.44% compared to a 19.90% return for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and beating the S&P 500 Index’s 15.29% gain. After a slow start to the quarter, U.S. stocks increased steadily in May and June. Increased worries about inflation, the pace of expected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were blamed for the early market weakness. In addition, you can check the fund's top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund highlighted stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an American multinational company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The one-month return of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was 0.67%, and its shares gained 27.81% of their value over the last three months. On August 20, 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $226.51 per share with a market capitalization of $3.444 billion.\n\nBaron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nStory continues 15 Countries With Highest Social Mobility In The World\n\nA busy sidewalk filled with people using Apple devices like iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in 9th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 184 hedge fund portfolios held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the second quarter which was 150 in the previous quarter. In the June quarter Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered $85.8 billion in revenues, up 5% from a year ago. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Every time Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) updates its considerable equity portfolio, the master investor is a hot watercooler topic for days. Much ink has been spilled, and breath expended, about the additions and subtractions with the portfolio. We're still just after the latest update, hence the considerable speculation lately.\n\nAs ever, though, there are numerous gems in the portfolio that are worthwhile for any investor to own no matter what the master is doing with them now. In that spirit, I'm highlighting two of the very best Buffett stocks at the moment: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO).\n\n1. Apple\n\nRecently, it seemed as if Apple was threatening to take up all the oxygen in Berkshire's equity portfolio. After all, the hugely popular tech stock's market value had expanded to more than half of the total for the entire collection. That percentage began to obey gravity when Buffett and his team enacted a series of sell-offs in recent months.\n\nThe sales pushed the tech giant's stock down, which is understandable -- Buffett no longer believes in Apple! I, for one, don't think those divestments mean the wily investor has lost his faith. Rather, it feels to me that the Berkshire crew is trimming the fruity stock if anything, significantly lowering its weight in the portfolio so it's more reasonably proportional. It's now under 30% of the total. The recent pronouncements by Bufffett appear to signal Berkshire's intention to hold on to a large stake.\n\nRegardless, when Buffett sells, many investors do the same. Since news first broke of the Apple divestments with the publication of Berkshire's second-quarter earnings report in early August, Apple stock has underperformed both the S&P 500 index and Berkshire's B shares. The scores are, respectively, 18% growth versus 23% versus nearly 26%.\n\nThis has left Apple shares slightly below their one-year maximum price, and anytime that happens I think it's a rare window of opportunity to own the shares at a bit of a discount. The company continues to be a high-margin behemoth, and as ever it's devising ways to keep growing despite its monster size and global prominence. In its third quarter, total net sales rose by almost 5% year over year to $85.8 billion, driven in no small part by record quarterly services revenue that raced 14% higher.\n\nI believe the company's got a very long growth runway. It's going to start packing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into its upcoming phone models, which should bolster demand for hardware and create yet more revenue streams for the company. Analysts agree with me that Apple will grow ever fatter; collectively they're predicting annual revenue increases of 9% this fiscal year and 8% next. Per-share earnings should advance by nearly 6% for the entirety of fiscal 2024, meanwhile, and by almost 7% in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nThe other company I think everyone should consider buying without hesitation is Coca-Cola. It's been in Berkshire's portfolio longer than many investors have been alive, and for good reason -- Coke not only owns one of the most powerful anchor brands in history; it has been a model income stock for decades.\n\nLike the familiar taste of its signature drink, Coca-Cola doesn't change much as a company, nor does it need to. It's a pure-play beverage company with a portfolio that really runs the gamut. It has traditional sodas like the company's namesake, to offerings aligning with current trends like the BodyArmor line of sports drinks, Dassani water, and Topo Chico's hard seltzer selection.\n\nEven the trendiest drinks aren't overly expensive or involved to manufacture, which is why Coke's margins have traditionally been high.\n\nThe company's second-quarter results were illustrative of this, with total revenue of $12.4 billion filtering down into a non-GAAP (adjusted) net income of just over $3.6 billion. That's a nearly 30% net margin. Also, by the way, both headline figures rose year over year. The top line by 3% and adjusted profitability at an almost 7% clip.\n\nHigh margin and continued growth are a combination of factors attractive enough for any stock. Coke sweetens the deal with a relatively generous shareholder payout that's always on the rise. The company is a Dividend King, that tiny group of stocks that have enacted dividend raises at least once annually for a minimum of 50 years in a row. In fact, the company is high on the leader board, with a dividend raise streak that's now reached an almost-inconceivable 62 years.\n\nManagement is acutely aware of how much of an attraction the dividend is on its own, so they make sure to keep it on the rise. These days, its quarterly distribution is just under $0.49 per share for a nice, thick dividend yield of 2.8%. That's more than double the percentage rate of the average S&P 500 stock payout, which currently sits at 1.3%.\n\nSo it's little wonder Buffett is a long-term fan of Coke. The beverage giant controls the strongest brand imaginable, its business is highly profitable and growing, and those constant dividend raises are good for any shareholder's wallet. There's little not to like about this stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Top CEOs stand by Business Roundtable shift to serve ‘all of our stakeholders’",
        "content": "Some of America’s most influential CEOs aren’t backing down from their assertion that a company’s purpose is to serve \"all of our stakeholders,\" re-affirming a major philosophical shift that jolted the business world five years ago.\n\nThe Business Roundtable, a powerful association of more than 200 CEOs, posted a new essay on Medium last Friday that offered a fresh endorsement of the group’s “purpose of a corporation” statement last updated in August 2019.\n\nThat statement argued that companies should not just act in the interest of their shareholders but instead in the long-term interests of \"all of our stakeholders\" — including customers, employees and larger society. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins chairs the Business Roundtable, a high-profile group comprised of prominent corporate bosses. (Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images) (Dia Dipasupil via Getty Images)\n\nIt was a step back from a statement that had been in place since 1997 asserting that a company's \"paramount duty\" was to its stockholders, a decades-old philosophy made popular by Nobel Prize-winning University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman.\n\n\"We’re proud of the statement and our members stand by it,\" Joshua Bolten, Business Roundtable’s CEO and a former chief of staff for President George W. Bush, told Yahoo Finance. The group is chaired by Cisco (CSCO) CEO Chuck Robbins.\n\nThe idea that broader purpose and profit go together represented a major shift for a group that includes many of the corporate world’s best-known figures, from Apple’s (AAPL) Tim Cook to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon to GM’s (GM) Mary Barra. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman poses with a sculpture of himself in 1986. (Photo by George Rose/Getty Images) (George Rose via Getty Images)\n\nIt remains a notable stance in 2024 as companies take more political heat for any support of policies that place heavy emphasis on environmental and diversity goals.\n\nBut Bolton said the Roundtable’s shift was never meant as an endorsement for so-called ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies.\n\n\"Right from the beginning, there's been a fair amount of misunderstanding about what the statement was about,\" he said.\n\nIt was misinterpreted by the ideological left and right to mean that companies had decided to commit resources to solving every societal ill, he added.\n\n\"I think, properly interpreted, the statement was an endorsement of support for the long-term shareholder, but perhaps not the short-term shareholder. Maybe not the hedge fund that dives in to take advantage of quarterly earnings.\"\n\nThe Business Roundtable’s new essay posted Friday offered evidence of ways in which member companies are living up to the philosophy, citing initiatives from PepsiCo (PEP), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Cisco (CSCO), JPMorgan (JPM), and Walmart (WMT) designed to benefit employees, students and US suppliers.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"When the Business Roundtable statement was announced in 2019, Fortune ran a headline, ‘Profits and Purpose: Can Big Business Have it Both Ways?’' the Roundtable members said in their collective post.\n\n\"The answer is yes — companies can and must.\" Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten, President George W. Bush's last White House Chief of Staff, pictured in 2011. (Photo by David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images) (David Hume Kennerly via Getty Images)\n\nYet shareholders are increasingly withholding support for proposals that would impose new ESG and DEI (diversity equity, and inclusion) policies at many companies.\n\nThese policies have also attracted a lot of political heat in an election year. Former President Donald Trump has promised to banish ESG-minded retirement account investments \"forever,\" while a top Trump ally has called DEI \"bigotry\" against white men.\n\nRepublican-led states are also pushing companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on the Supreme Court's decision in 2023 to strike down race-based admission policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.\n\nThe current political environment creates challenges and dilemmas for all companies, including those that are part of the Business Roundtable.

        "title": "Here Are All 45 Stocks Warren Buffett Holds for Berkshire Hathaway's $314 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "Although most investors were laser-focused on the release of the July inflation report last week, they may have missed what could be described as the most insightful data dump of the third quarter.\n\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F is the filing that alerts investors to the stocks, exchange-traded funds, and (occasionally) options that Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nNo asset manager garners more attention on Wall Street than Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) billionaire CEO Warren Buffett. That's because Buffett has overseen an increase in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,387,000% since becoming CEO in 1965. When you run circles around Wall Street's major stock indexes, investors of all walks will want to ride your coattails.\n\nAccording to Berkshire's newest 13F, the appropriately named \"Oracle of Omaha\" and his investment lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, are overseeing a 45-stock portfolio spread across $314 billion of invested assets. Make note that this figure excludes the two index funds Berkshire currently holds small stakes in -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust -- because index funds are comprised of baskets of securities and aren't themselves stocks.\n\nHere's a thorough breakdown of Warren Buffett's portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBuffett's portfolio is highly concentrated in eight core investments\n\nAt quick glance, you'd assume Buffett, Combs, and Weschler were well diversified, given that their company has $314 billion spread out across 45 stocks -- but you'd be sorely mistaken. In reality, more than 79% of Berkshire's invested assets can be traced back to eight core holdings.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $90,420,000,000 in market value (as of Aug. 16) American Express: $38,161,929,297 Bank of America(NYSE: BAC): $37,075,191,558 Coca-Cola: $27,672,000,000 Chevron(NYSE: CVX): $17,467,773,342 Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY): $14,706,768,598 Moody's: $11,513,878,788 Kraft Heinz: $11,273,477,399\n\nDespite Berkshire's team being big net-sellers of equities over the last seven quarters, these eight investments make crystal clear that Buffett prefers to have an outsized percentage of his company's capital put to work in his best ideas.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise here is energy stocks accounting for a double-digit percentage of invested assets. Buffett has overseen the purchase of more than 255.2 million shares of Occidental Petroleum since the start of 2022 and also holds around 118.6 million shares of Chevron.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistorically, energy stocks haven't played a key role in Buffett's portfolio. But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple years of capital underinvestment by global energy majors (including Chevron) has led to tight global oil supply. When the supply of an in-demand commodity is constrained, this often means its spot price receives a boost. Occidental Petroleum, in particular, generates the bulk of its revenue from its drilling segment, and would be a prime beneficiary of a sustainably higher spot price for crude oil.\n\nIt is worth noting that Buffett and his crew have sold well over 500 million shares of their top holding, Apple, since Oct. 1, 2023, and they recently dumped north of $3.8 billion worth of Bank of America stock over 12 consecutive trading sessions (July 17 – Aug. 1).\n\nThough it's highly unlikely Buffett has lost faith in the management teams of either company, Berkshire is sitting on mammoth unrealized gains in Apple and Bank of America. With the stock market at historically pricey levels, and Buffett opining during his company's annual shareholder meeting in May that he believes corporate tax rates will climb, locking in some gains makes perfect sense. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has 20 additional billion-dollar wagers\n\nEven though the lion's share of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets can be traced back to the aforementioned eight brand-name companies, it doesn't mean there aren't sizable wagers elsewhere. As of the closing bell on Aug. 16, there were 20 holdings that ranged in value between $1.2 billion and $7.4 billion.\n\nChubb(NYSE: CB): $7,391,306,883 Mitsubishi(OTC: MSBHF)(OTC: MTSU.Y): $7,357,559,195 Itochu(OTC: ITOCY)(OTC: ITOCF): $5,744,464,819 DaVita: $5,425,164,171 Mitsui(OTC: MITSY)(OTC: MITSF): $5,390,943,959 Citigroup: $3,392,030,536 Kroger: $2,659,500,000 Marubeni(OTC: MARUY): $2,416,778,056 Sumitomo(OTC: SSUM.Y)(OTC: SSUM.F): $2,388,438,078 VeriSign: $2,305,016,154 Visa: $2,218,574,855 Mastercard: $1,869,259,514 Amazon: $1,770,600,000 BYD: $1,550,124,061 Liberty Sirius XM Group Series C(NASDAQ: LSXMK): $1,540,063,734 Nu Holdings: $1,509,303,667 Capital One Financial: $1,370,346,897 Aon: $1,361,405,000 Charter Communications: $1,352,803,145 Ally Financial: $1,218,870,000\n\nOne of the interesting quirks about Buffett's \"other\" billion-dollar investments is that this section contains five of the eight companies he described as \"indefinite\" holdings in his most recent annual letter to shareholders.\n\nAside from longtime holdings Coca-Cola and American Express, as well as Occidental Petroleum, Buffett listed the five Japanese trading houses (Mitsubishi, Itochu, Mitsui, Marubeni, and Sumitomo) as forever-type holdings for his company. The only reason Buffett hasn't purchased an even larger stake in these businesses is because he has to keep Berkshire Hathaway's stake in all five companies below 10%.\n\nThe \"why?\" behind Mitsubishi, Itochu, Mitsui, Marubeni, and Sumitomo has everything to do with these companies being cyclical and cheap. The Oracle of Omaha is a big fan of diversified companies able to take advantage of long-winded periods of economic expansion. When those businesses have single-digit price-to-earnings ratios, hearty capital-return programs, and CEOs with reasonably low compensation packages, Buffett tends to be a happy camper.\n\nThere's also a sizable presence of financial stocks among Buffett's billion-dollar ventures. It's here we find insurer Chubb, which was the confidential stock Berkshire's brightest minds began building a position in last summer. Insurers typically possess strong premium pricing power, and they've notably benefited from higher net interest income on their float (i.e., premium collected that hasn't been paid out via claims) over the last two years.\n\nWarren Buffett's smaller holdings\n\nTo round things out, the roughly $314 billion portfolio overseen by Buffett, Combs, and Weschler also has 17 \"smaller\" holdings, ranging in market value from a little over $9 million to as much as $918 million.\n\nT-Mobile: $918,328,320 Liberty Sirius XM Group Series A(NASDAQ: LSXMA): $774,712,462 Liberty Formula One Series C: $594,705,952 Louisiana-Pacific: $561,167,725 Liberty Live Series C: $430,810,903 Floor & Décor: $418,352,588 Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI): $398,634,639 Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA): $260,328,686 HEICO Class A: $195,471,660 Liberty Live Series A: $192,282,833 NVR: $96,329,150 Diageo: $29,293,205 Liberty Latin America Series A: $25,650,222 Jefferies Financial Group: $24,946,927 Lennar Class B: $24,352,017 Liberty Latin America Series C: $12,570,556 Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C: $9,370,726\n\nIf there's a prevailing theme to these sub-$1 billion wagers, it's that these companies were likely purchased, and/or are actively overseen, by Combs and Weschler.\n\nFor instance, Wall Street has been crowing about Berkshire's purchase of more than 690,000 shares of Ulta Beauty following the release of Berkshire's second-quarter 13F. While Ulta's chain of cosmetics stores have been a popular launch point for a number of beauty products, cosmetics are well outside the realm of where Buffett focuses his research. This makes it highly likely that Combs and/or Weschler is behind this trade.\n\nYou can also see a potential arbitrage opportunity at play among these smaller holdings. In particular, Berkshire's stake in Sirius XM Holdings has more than tripled over the last three months. By the end of September, Sirius XM is expected to complete its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group, to create a single class of shares. Sirius XM will also conduct a 1-for-10 reverse split upon consummation of the merger.\n\nDifferences in price between Sirius XM and Liberty Sirius XM Group may be opening the door for Buffett and his investing lieutenants to take advantage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, The Coca-Cola Co. KO, Star Group, L.P. SGU and Aware, Inc. AWRE.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Apple, NVIDIA and Coca-Cola\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and The Coca-Cola Co., as well as two micro-cap stocks Star Group, L.P. and Aware, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\n\nApple shares have lagged the the Zacks Tech sector past year ( +28.8% vs. +38.6%), but performed roughly in-line with the broader market (+28.8% vs. +27.5% for the S&P 500 index). Weighing on the stock's muted momentum is the macro overhang from China whose economic outlook continues to remain uncertain. The company reported a decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues.\n\nApple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis.\n\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\n\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+160.7% vs. +114.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nStory continues\n\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\n\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\n\nCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. +11.3%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In second-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, with both metrics showing year-over-year improvement.\n\nStrong revenue growth across most operating segments, supported by improved price/mix and unit volume growth aided results. KO is well-poised to benefit from innovations and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024.\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\n\nShares of Star have gained +6.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry’s gain of +11.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $409.70 million witnessed strong revenue growth, driven by a 25.3% increase in heating oil and propane volumes, and improved margins despite warmer weather.\n\nStrategic acquisitions are bolstering market position, adding significant volume and operational synergies. The company has enhanced profitability by reducing its adjusted EBITDA loss by $18.9 million and maintaining strong cost control, leading to improved margins. Star Group's leadership in home heating, diversification into related services and a robust balance sheet with solid cash flow management further strengthen its investment case.\n\nHowever, challenges include declining heating oil volumes, weather sensitivity, customer attrition and rising operating expenses. Additionally, the company faces competitive pressures from alternative energy sources, which could impact market share and profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Star here >>>)\n\nAware’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry over the year-to-date period (+48.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $53.17 million witnessed 17% revenue growth in the first half of 2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and a 14% rise in recurring revenue, reflects a shift toward a subscription model and underscores its market expansion and improved financial predictability.\n\nStrategic cost management reduced operating expenses by 7%, narrowing net losses and enhancing adjusted EBITDA. The shift to a recurring revenue model, with a 31% second-quarter 2024 revenue uptick, and securing large contracts, including a $1.2 million automated biometric identification system (ABIS) deal, highlight Aware's growing global footprint.\n\nYet, declining cash reserves, continued net losses, reliance on government contracts and limited market diversification pose significant risks. Increasing competition and execution risks in strategic initiatives could pressure revenue growth and profitability.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Aware here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Timely rotations help hedge funds navigate summer volatility: Goldman Sachs",
        "content": "In its latest “Hedge Fund Trend Monitor” report published Tuesday, Goldman Sachs highlights how timely rotations by hedge funds have helped them successfully navigate recent bouts of market volatility.\n\nDuring the first half of 2024, hedge funds made significant positioning adjustments, particularly in the \"Magnificent\" mega-cap stocks, trimming their exposure even as these stocks continued to outperform. Notably, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were exceptions, with hedge funds increasing their stakes in these companies.\n\nThese moves, according to Goldman Sachs, lowered the Hedge Fund Crowding Index and helped funds mitigate the impact of the subsequent volatility that arose from a rotation away from mega-caps, which later evolved into a sharp cyclical-led selloff in early August.\n\nThe bank reveals that US equity long/short hedge funds have returned 9% year-to-date, outperforming broader market indices. The Hedge Fund VIP list, which tracks the most popular long positions, has delivered a 19% return, despite a 10% market selloff in July. This list includes stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which remain central to hedge fund portfolios.\n\n“Today, with the S&P 500 close to its high, hedge fund net and gross exposures register above 5-year averages but below levels carried before the selloff,” Goldman notes.\n\nIn another timely shift in the second quarter, hedge funds halted a rotation toward cyclicals that had begun in mid-2022.\n\nSpecifically, funds have moved their overweight position to Health Care, now the best-performing sector during the recent downturn relative to the Russell 3000. At the same time, they increased exposure to Industrials and Financials while reducing holdings in Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology.\n\nAccording to the note, this was the first time hedge funds lifted Financials to overweight since 2010.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTimely rotations help hedge funds navigate summer volatility: Goldman Sachs\n\nAlcon shares drop on earnings miss\n\nRussia's Rostec chief suggests protective measures on assembled car imports\n\nView comments",

We are pleased to share our achievements in this quarter and the strategies we have implemented in the evolving landscape where the circular economy has been driving consumer behavior.\r\n In the second quarter, we achieved solid growth, especially at the recycling and in value-for-money retail business, even though consumers are more prudent with spending. To boost domestic consumption the government has taken actions to encourage large scale trade-ins of consumer goods.\r\n As a result, more products have entered the pre-owned market through e-commerce platforms and physical retailers. In the near term, we have already witnessed a significant increase in recycling volumes in cities Shanghai. More importantly, would leave such policies and support will have a long-lasting impact by raising awareness of sustainable consumption and the restarting of secondhand goods. Such support provides greater certainty to our sustained growth outlook.\r\n Looking specifically at our business performance in the second quarter, our total revenue reached RMB3.78 million, up 27.4% year-over-year, exceeding the high end -- of our guidance. Product revenue was RMB3.4 million, up 29% year-over-year, serving as the main growth drivers.\r\n Notably, order volume related to our core self-operated consumer electronics recycling business grew 27.8%, while other off volume of the overall self-operated business that included low ASP business grew 38.9% year-over year, mainly in the second hand.\r\n Among primary recycling scenarios, trade-ins have become an increasingly mainstream way to shop. We collaborated with JD.com on their old iPhone product for new Apple product initiatives, which received widespread praise from users.\r\n In May, the recycling value of used products created in through JD.com grew 97.6% year-over-year. During the June 18 shopping festival, the trading volume of use the consumer electronic products from JD.com increased by 100% year-over-year.\r\n In our platform business revenue grew 14.6% year-over-year to RMB370 million. PJT and Paipai Marketplace maintain healthy, take rates with an increasing number of third party merchants, leveraging our inspection capabilities and adopting our consignment model.\r\n The GMV of our multi-category recycling service business increased by nearly 400% year-over-year, serving as the main driver of platform business growth and reflecting that in the current micro environment, an increasing number of users are willing to explore recycling services beyond consumer electronics categories.\r\n On the growth margin front, we successfully turned to a gross margin of the Apple trading business positive in the second quarter, raising the overall product revenue growth margin to 12.1%, an increase of 1.2 percentage-points from the first quarter of 2024.\r\n Gross margin at a group level slightly dropped to 20.8% as the proportion of product revenue increased by 1.1-percentage-points compared with the second quarter of 2023. Even though the economies of scale have also led to improved cost efficiency, the non-GAAP fulfillment expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 0.3 percentage-points year-over-year. While the non-GAAP selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue fell by 1.1-percentage-point year-over-year.\r\n This overall resulted in a 0.7-percentage-points improvement year-over-year in the non-GAAP operating profit margin, bringing it to 2.5% in the second quarter of 2024.\r\n The achievements we've discussed so far are rooted in our core strengths in recycling scenarios and supply chain capabilities. Going forward, we will continue to build on these strengths to drive further growth and success.\r\n On one hand, we have strengthened our service capabilities in our core business of consumer electronics, recycling and transaction services. In June, we renewed our strategic agreement to deepen our business collaboration with JD.com in areas such as consumer electronics, recycling, tradings and the retail of value for money secondhand products.\r\n This renewal also introduced new training methods for Apple products. We continue to meet the high standards and specific needs of JD's users through our industry-leading fulfillment and supply chain capabilities.\r\n Our trading business through JD has experienced a rapid growth. In the first half of the year, the recycling value of products traded in by JD users increased by over 50% year-over-year. Notably in June, the recycling value of product fulfilled by trading program surpassed that of regular recycling for the first time, establishing it as the leading recycling methods through JD.\r\n [Trillions] provide a better user experience than revenue recycling. Effectively capturing users' demand for upgraded devices and receiving growing acceptance and adoption by our users.\r\n Our Apple official trading business, we successfully turned the gross margin positive as anticipated in the second quarter. During these typically off-peak period, we achieved RMB116 million revenue. Specifically, we ensured a positive operating margin for this segment in the second quarter, while aiming at a long-term operating profit margin of 3% to 4%, expenses at the operating level are simple, and we expect Apple's official training business to bring more positive operating profit.\r\n We continue to build our offline fulfillment capabilities to strengthen our business model. As of the end of the second quarter, we operated 1,516 AHS insurance offline stores in 260 cities nationwide. With a net increase of 19 self-operated stores and 69 jointly operated stores in the quarter.\r\n Meet users' demand for multi-category recycling, we upgraded our store image for location of over 50 self-operated stores. Additionally, we have a nationwide doorstep service team of over 600 staff to address users' diverse fulfillment needs.\r\n Our service team maintains a consistent brand image and service standard. Offering face to face devices inspections and on the clock payments, which provides several advantages over traditional mail in recycling. In the second quarter, the doorstep recycling business sustain the same year-over-year growth rate as the overall C2B business. Our in-store and door step fulfillment options offer users flexible and convenient recycling choices.\r\n On the other hand, we are further enhancing our core capabilities in client shopping scenarios and supply chain management. These improvements aim to provide users with a wider selection of premium products while strengthening the brand recognition of Asia selection.\r\n We are witnessing a clear trend that consumers are increasingly looking for value for money, high quality pre-owned products. We offer a curated selection of premium secondhand products in our offline stores, allowing consumers to directly access the quality of certified pre-owned items that are 95% and 90% new stimulating their interest in trying and purchasing these products.\r\n By linking in-store inventory with our nationwide online inventory. We provide consumers with cost effective options for buying secondhand items. This capability has successfully gained the trust and recognition of our AHS selection brands. In the second quarter, product revenue from AHS selection or off-line stores and on our official website surpassed RMB210 million, marking an increase of 31% year-over-year. -- Existing marking an 31% increase from the previous quarter and an eight fold increase year-over-year.\r\n Product revenue brought by our PJT to see retail business increased by 125% year-over-year to RMB960 million. Retail channels, including the Paipai selection, AHS recycle websites and physical stores, in et cetera.\r\n During on our robust end-to-end supply chain capabilities from sourcing to processing to sales, we are exploring synergies with retail partners in addition to the established retail channels of Paipai AHS store and live streaming platforms.\r\n In June, our B2B transaction platform PJT Marketplace partnered with the e-commerce to empower more small and medium-sized businesses to thrive in the new retail landscape by leveraging PJT leading second hand, consumer electronics supply chain. Key elements of our collaboration include our operations center, which supports product quality inspections and PJT supplying secondhand consumer electronics to the e-commerce.\r\n Additionally, PJT has established a strategic partnership with [Ford on behalf] a leading retailer in mass market cities. Together, we are exploring opportunities for secondhand products through [point home] extensive offline store network. Initial sales pilot programs have already been launched recently.\r\n In closing, we would like to share our perspective on establishing our brand as the top of mind choice for consumers nationwide when it comes to recycling.\r\n Starting the last year, we have increased our marketing efforts to promote our upgraded services in recycling to raise the awareness of our brand and to improve public understanding of recycling trade-ins and circular consumption.\r\n We have distributed educational content about recycling and trade-ins on popular social media platforms, including [billion. So harmful waste in a] (spoken in foreign language) video platform, while partnering with key influencers to advertise our brand name.\r\n Moreover, we have collaborated with leading consumer brands to launch their revised financial initiatives. In the second quarter, we rolled out training programs in partnership with 20 brand owners championing the concept of sustainable circular consumption to name a few [in building out new Bilibili measure. And all the drugs] (spoken in foreign language) -- which wants to encourage more consumers to pick up a quest, return more used to boost and claimed the rewards.\r\n Given the clear shift in consumer behaviors, we believe it is crucial to proactively seize the opportunities presented by the circular economy. We will continue to invest in our brand. We aim to acquire greater mind share for our brands and services among consumers through strategic brand marketing, cross-brand partnerships and preventing our stores.\r\n As we enter the third quarter, we are preparing for the upcoming launch season for new cellphone models in September and October. We look forward to serving even more users by facilitating the recycling and transactions of their secondhand products through our enhanced service offerings.\r\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Rex for financial updates.\n\nStory continues\n\nRex Chen\n\nHello, everyone. We are pleased to report another profitable quarter and GAAP measures. On revenues once again exceeded the top end of our guidance. Before taking a detailed look at the financials, Please note that all figures are in RMB and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise stated.\r\n In the second quarter, total revenues increased by 27.4% to RMB3,776.7 million, primarily driven by the strong growth in net product revenues. Net product revenues increased by 29% to RMB3,401.8 million, while net service revenues increased by 14.6% to RMB374.9 million. Both in net product revenues was primary driven by an increase in sales of prolonged consumer electronics was -- companies online and offline channels.\r\n The increase in service revenues was primarily due to an increase in the service revenue generated from PJT Marketplace and the multi category for cycling finish. So overall, gross transaction value of Marketplace increased its consistency with service revenues and the take rate of our Marketplace was [5.28%] in second quarter of 2024.\r\n Above RMB30 million was directly attributable to our multi-category recycling business with an average AHS growth of 3%. Multi-category recycling business accounted for 8% of total service revenues in the second quarter of 2024, while the figure was a 1% in the same period of 2023.\r\n Now let's discuss our operating expenses. To provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operating based expenses. We will also discuss our non-GAAP operating expenses, which better reflect how management views our results of operations. The reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and corresponding Form-6K furnished with the SEC.\r\n Merchandise costs increased by 28.6% to RMB2,990.06 million, in line with the growth in product revenues. Gross margins at group level at 20.8% in the second quarter. Product revenues, gross margin, which we also refer to as one key business gross margin was 12.1%.\r\n Fulfillment expenses increased by 22.1% to RMB328.3 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses, which we will refer to as SBC here on. In debt fulfillment expenses increased by 22.9% to RMB321.7 million and GAAP measures to increase was primarily due to; first, an increase in personnel costs. As the company conducted more recycling and transaction activities compared with the same period of time 2023. And secondly, increasing our operation center related expenses as the company expanded its store and operation station networks. Non-GAAP fulfillment expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 8.5% from 8.8%.\r\n Selling and marketing expenses increased by 5.6% to RMB354 million, excluding SBC expenses and amortization of intangible assets and deferred costs resulting from assets and business acquisitions, non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses increased by 11.7% to RMB283.3 million, primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses and promotional campaign related expenses. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 7.5% from 8.6%.\r\n General and administrative expenses increased by 26.1% to RMB72.5 million. Excluding SBC expenses, non-GAAP G&A expenses increased by 41.9% to RMB56.2 million, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs. Non-GAAP G&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues was a 1.5% compared to 1.3% in the same period of 2023.\r\n Technology and content expenses increased by 10.6% to RMB49.8 million, excluding SBC expenses and amortization of intangible assets and deferred cost resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP technology and content expenses increased by 12.6% to RMB43.7 million. So the increase was primarily due to a increase in personnel costs in connection with the ongoing upgrade of the company's operation center system. Non-GAAP technology and content expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 1.2% from 1.3%.\r\n As a result, our non-GAAP operating income was RMB94.1 million meeting to second quarter of 2024, representing a significant increase of 81% year-on-year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 2.5% compared to 1.8% in the second quarter of 2023 and our ongoing share repurchase program, which our Board of Directors approved it as uplifting limits to purchase USD50 million through June 27, 2025.\r\n We have returned approximately USD8 million to our shareholders for a total number of RMB3.3 million [ADS] as of June 30, 2024\r\n As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments and funds receivable from third partly payment service providers totaled RMB2.8 billion. Our strong cash position safeguards are sustainable growth outlook.\r\n Now turning to the business outlook. For the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate total revenues to be between RMB3,970 million and -- RMB4,070 million, representing an increase of 21.9% to 25% year-over-year. Please note that this forecast only reflects our current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change\r\n This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions)\r\n Joyce Ju, Bank of America.\n\n(Interpreted)\r\n I'll translate myself. This is Julian, on behalf of Joyce from Bank of America. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a solid result this quarter. We see the our recent domestic policies have increased support for large-scale consumer goods trading such as subsidies announced by the National Development and Reform Commission in July. How do these policies impact your business?\n\nThank you for the questions. Since the State Council released his action plan for large-scale consumer goods trading in March, we observed both central and local policy support, mainly focusing on computers, cars and home appliances.\r\n In July, the NDRC and Ministry of Finance issued measures to further support these tradings, we've seen more cities implementing specific subsidies for electronic products, including home appliances and computers. You renew and JD.com have collaborated to meet users' trading in, securing more high quality first and recycling projects.\r\n Currently fund specific subsidies are being implemented at the local level. For instance, exchanges, Shanghai July trading subsidy program, we process used consumer electronics products from JD's trading orders. The number of successful recycling transactions increased 2.5 times compared with the number in June, even though June was the peak month considering the brand promotion season, reflecting the popularity of such an initiative.\r\n In the second half of the year, we expect more cities to introduce similar subsidies, further promoting the effective recycling of auto electronic products within the circular economy. However, we primarily view these policy subsidies as catalyst for enhancing users' recycling awareness. Some studies suggest this round of subsidy may last longer than previous programs like home appliances going into the country sites.\r\n Therefore, we aim to seize these opportunities to strengthen the recycling system [in-house, Asia's] recycle brand recognition and guide users towards trading. We anticipate that as national and local subsidy policies are introduced, user acceptance increases and our fulfillment capabilities strengthen. These factors will collectively promote further penetration of this unique service model in the circular economy.\n\nOperator\n\nJiajing Chen, CICC.\n\nJiajing Chen\n\n(Interpreted)\r\n Congratulations on the solid results. And I have two questions. The first one is about the top line. What are the contributions on the compliance refurbishment business and your Apple trading business? And the second one, could you please elaborate on how you improve your non-GAAP operating margin?\n\nOkay, thank you. I will take your question. In terms of the component refurbishment, we saw a 50% year-over-year increase in the second quarter, which RMB9,300 million in product revenue in the first half of this year, we continued to enhance our selection of self-cycled goods.\r\n Swift, identifying suitable forms for the fulfillment and the improving efficiency across our value chain. Currently, we have achieved 95% comparison coverage in that mobile phone category, laying a solid foundation for future application to other categories.\r\n At the same time, we have enhanced our payer coverage and the capabilities and the processing capabilities for different conditions. Additionally, we have posted to our sales comparatives for 1P goods opening up channels for both retail and business buyers, better connecting [CM2] and industrial chain.\r\n Regarding edibles that holds official trading service, we have successfully optimized our gross margin has penned achieving a positive gross margin second quarter. Although the overall gross margin for our Apple business, the second quarter was already low single digits, we observed significant improvements in gross margin focus receiving during the second quarter.\r\n We will continue to define this finishing second half of this year, aiming to provide an excellent trading experience for Apple's official users while maintaining steady profitability.\r\n In the first half of this year, in addition to our work consumer end trading service, we also enhanced our service to Apple's corporate offerings. Based on Apple's orders from a number of Fortune 500 corporates. We expect to recover used devices from, -- corporates clients in next one to three years.\r\n So such a program we can access the corporate service market while addressing the needs of leading international and domestic coverage when you dispose of disposing of used to workplace iPhone, MacBooks of their employees.\r\n In terms of profitability, we reported in a -- consider Q2 quarter with positive net GAAP operating profit. In the second quarter net GAAP operating profit was RMB94 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 2.5% during the promotional season of e-commerce platforms, comparative was 7.8% in the second quarter of 2023. Such improved operating efficiency was a testament to that economy of [scale backed] by our end-to-end supply chain.\r\n As I mentioned, earnings in the second quarter of 2024, non-GAAP fulfillment expenses increased by 22.9% and the GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased by 11.7%. Both grow slower than our top line. Labor costs in relation to fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 0.2% compared with the second quarter of -- industry, although promotion fees related to the branded promotion of AHS cycle has increased, but the commission fees and the promotion fees of PJT Marketplace and Paipai in relation to sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenues dropped. So both are the main reasons behind the improvement in margin.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Kim, Zacks Research.\n\nMichael Kim\n\nGood morning or good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just curious how the gross margins for the recycling of luxury goods, compare to consumer electronics and then assuming the mix continues to shift in favor of luxury items. Just wondering how that might impact, overall gross margins. And then I do have a second question.\n\nRex Chen\n\nSo for your first question, currently approximately 90% of our total revenues comes from product sales related to the cycling quality inspection and the -- resale of growing products. So the remaining 10% of our total revenues come from service revenues generated by our platform.\r\n Revenues, equivalent to the gross profit for this segment in our financial statements of this service revenues, 8% is attributable to our motor category for recycling [finish operated under the platform model]. But the in terms of the operating profit margin, so luxury goods products will be similar to our electronic products.\r\n So when we examine same as that of a cycling business of high value goods, including luxury items, we categorized some are part of our multi-category business alongside as and then consumer electronic categories.\r\n This indicates that the motor category, the Cycling business currently has a limited impact on our overall gross margin, however, we believe centered by expanding the scope and accessibility of our multi-category recycling services, we can positively influence our overall gross profit mix and the margins as well as the operating profit margin.\n\nMichael Kim\n\nIt makes sense. Appreciate that. And then second, just given the strength of your balance sheet and your asset-light business model, just curious to hear your updated thinking on the capital management front. I know you talked about the Board recently upsizing and extending the share repurchase authorization. But just wondering how you might be thinking about potentially instituting a dividend down the road and or capitalizing on potential M&A opportunities? Thanks.\n\nRex Chen\n\nOkay. Thank you. In terms of the in terms of our shareholder returns were maintained regular and open communication with the Board and the market to explore sustainability of -- buyback and dividend trend and our current plan to use most of our current year profit for share repurchase in calendar year. So considering the current capital market environment and to accompany this stage of development, we will adopt a prudent approach to capital utilization and we do not have any M&A paying now.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our question-and answer-session. I would like to hand the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you. Thank you all again for joining us. So a replay of today's call will be available on our website shortly, followed by a transcript when ready. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to email us at ir@atrenew.com. Have a nice day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\n\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\n\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\n\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% — the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 184\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. AI-related developments linked to the company are eagerly followed on social media because the company already has billions of Apple devices in the hands of customers around the world, most of which would be able to perform AI tasks as Apple introduces new software features for them. Reports this week have suggested that the firm is also working on a humanoid device powered by AI, for purposes as wide ranging as use as a desktop device to a home security robot, and that production of these devices could begin as early as 2026 or 2027. The new device would run Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI offerings that will soon be rolling out on Apple devices worldwide.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the few tech firms with a stellar financial record. The company has not missed third quarter consensus expectations in close to a decade. Perhaps this is the reason that investment advisory Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $273 ahead of September. Analyst Erik Woodring noted in his bullish thesis that based on the latest checks, iPhone builds in July were stronger than originally expected, leading to an upward revision to September quarter iPhone builds to 54 million units, up 8% year-over-year and 2 million units higher than the previous forecast.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Top Analyst Reports for Apple, NVIDIA &amp; Coca-Cola",
        "content": "Tuesday, August 20, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO), as well as two micro-cap stocks Star Group, L.P. (SGU) and Aware, Inc. (AWRE). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have lagged the the Zacks Tech sector past year ( +28.8% vs. +38.6%), but performed roughly in-line with the broader market (+28.8% vs. +27.5% for the S&P 500 index). Weighing on the stock's muted momentum is the macro overhang from China whose economic outlook continues to remain uncertian. The company reported decline in iPhone sales in third-quarter fiscal 2024 partially offset by strong growth in Services revenues. \r\n\r\nApple now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. \r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of NVIDIA have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the year-to-date period (+160.7% vs. +114.9%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. \r\n\r\nA surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. \r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola shares have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+18.9% vs. +11.3%). The company experiences positive business trends, as evidenced by its strong track record of beating expectations. In second-quarter 2024, the company exceeded sales and earnings estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, with both metrics showing year-over-year improvement. \r\n\r\nStrong revenue growth across most operating segments, supported by improved price/mix and unit volume growth aided results. KO is well-poised to benefit from innovations and growing digital investments. It has provided an optimistic view for 2024. \r\n\r\nHowever, Coca-Cola faces inflationary cost pressures due to higher commodity and material costs, as well as increased marketing investments.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Star have gained +6.6% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Products industry’s gain of +11.1%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $409.70 million witnessed strong revenue growth, driven by a 25.3% increase in heating oil and propane volumes, and improved margins despite warmer weather. \r\n\r\nStrategic acquisitions are bolstering market position, adding significant volume and operational synergies. The company has enhanced profitability by reducing its adjusted EBITDA loss by $18.9 million and maintaining strong cost control, leading to improved margins. Star Group's leadership in home heating, diversification into related services and a robust balance sheet with solid cash flow management further strengthen its investment case. \r\n\r\nHowever, challenges include declining heating oil volumes, weather sensitivity, customer attrition and rising operating expenses. Additionally, the company faces competitive pressures from alternative energy sources, which could impact market share and profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Star here >>>)\r\n\r\nAware’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry over the year-to-date period (+48.8% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $53.17 million witnessed 17% revenue growth in the first half of 2024, driven by new customer acquisitions and a 14% rise in recurring revenue, reflects a shift toward a subscription model and underscores its market expansion and improved financial predictability. \r\n\r\nStrategic cost management reduced operating expenses by 7%, narrowing net losses and enhancing adjusted EBITDA. The shift to a recurring revenue model, with a 31% second-quarter 2024 revenue uptick, and securing large contracts, including a $1.2 million automated biometric identification system (ABIS) deal, highlight Aware's growing global footprint. \r\n\r\nYet, declining cash reserves, continued net losses, reliance on government contracts and limited market diversification pose significant risks. Increasing competition and execution risks in strategic initiatives could pressure revenue growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Aware here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO), GE Aerospace (GE) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "Nvidia helped the stock market storm back, but this summer’s broadening theme never went away",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is back near all-time highs.\n\nA recent rally in tech, including a nearly 30% pop in Nvidia (NVDA), has helped bring the index up more than 7% since its Aug. 5 bottom.\n\nIn that time, the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — have added more than $1.4 trillion in market cap, nearly half of the S&P 500's $3.2 trillion market cap gain since Aug. 5.\n\nAfter a massive drawdown in July, the recent surge helped bring the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) out of correction in 11 days, marking its shortest correction since October 2011.\n\nNed Davis Research chief US strategist Ed Clissold recently told Yahoo Finance that given how tech led the losses in the drawdown, it \"makes sense that they're going to rebound.\"\n\nAnd now, some of the largest names in the sector are sitting back near 52-week highs ahead of a crucial earnings report from Nvidia on Aug. 28.\n\nDuring second quarter earnings season, some of Nvidia's AI-powered rivals offered a mixed bag of results that struggled to live up to Wall Street's expectations.\n\n\"This would be the ninth day in a row the S&P is up,\" Niles Investment Management founder Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"It's the longest streak since 2004. I wouldn't necessarily be pushing that into an Nvidia print.\n\n\"But I think if you're not worried about what happens the day after and you're thinking about this over a multiyear period of time, it should be in pretty good shape.\" A sign is displayed on a Nvidia office building in Santa Clara, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAnd while the AI trade has once again been leading the market's latest leg higher, there have been promising developments under the surface at play too.\n\nThe S&P 500 equal-weighted index (^SPXEW), which is less influenced than the cap-weighted S&P by moves in Big Tech, just hit a new record high. Sectors including Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Health Care (XLV) are now sitting at 52-week highs, while Financials (XLF) are currently at a record level.\n\n\"This has been a really healthy rally in our view,\" Abby Yoder, JPMorgan US equity strategist, told Yahoo Finance. \"It has been this broadening out. Breadth is the best that it's been since the summer of last year. In terms of the participation across different sectors, different names.\"\n\nStill, the S&P 500 is up almost 18% this year, outpacing the equal-weighted index's nearly 9% this year.\n\n\"The reality is that in bull markets, all sectors typically go up,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn July, Gordon's team at Schwab pointed out in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that the amount of S&P 500 companies outperforming the index on a rolling two-month basis had fallen to a historic low.\n\nSince then, that narrative has fully flipped. As of Monday's close, roughly 58% of members in the S&P 500 were outperforming the index, the largest swath of outperformance since November 2022, when the current bull market began.\n\n\"The trend is much more important,\" Gordon said. \"Across those metrics, things look relatively healthy.\"\n\nRecent economic data has showed a slowing, but still growing, US economy, and market action over the last few weeks is in line with the soft-landing-fueled broadening out trade strategists have been discussing since the start of 2024.\n\nAnd though tech will likely still contribute to the rally, Ned Davis's Yoder said the rotation in other areas could have more room as the \"growth backdrop does look healthy and we're about to embark on a Fed [interest rate] cutting cycle as well.\"\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is It A Sign? Warren Buffett's Latest Move With Apple Stock Is Still Puzzling Investors. But There May Be More Behind It",
        "content": "Is It A Sign? Warren Buffett's Latest Move With Apple Stock Is Still Puzzling Investors. But There May Be More Behind It\n\nWarren Buffett, the legendary investor known as the “Oracle of Omaha” (and “Fireball” by his father), is famous for his smart investment choices. So when it was revealed that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, sold half its Apple shares, many investors were puzzled, trying to understand what it meant.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors. Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nIs it all just a coincidence, or is there more to it? Some experts think Buffett prefers round numbers, so stopping at 400 million shares might not be a big deal. Others see Buffett positioning Apple as a key, long-term investment, similar to how he views Coca-Cola.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway sold over 100 million Apple shares, and in the second quarter, they sold an additional 390 million shares. Despite this sell-off, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's largest public investment, with around 400 million shares worth nearly $90 billion.\n\nTrending:Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nHere are the top five Berkshire Hathaway holdings as of June 30, 2024:\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nShares held: 400,000,000 Holding value: $84,248,000,000 Percent of portfolio: 30.52% Bank of America (BAC)\n\nShares held: 942,429,882 Holding value: $37,225,980,339 Percent of portfolio: 13.48% American Express (AXP)\n\nShares held: 151,610,700 Holding value: $35,105,457,585 Percent of portfolio: 12.72% Coca-Cola (KO)\n\nShares held: 400,000,000 Holding value: $25,460,000,000 Percent of portfolio: 9.22% Chevron (CVX)\n\nShares held: 118,610,534 Holding value: $18,553,059,728 Percent of portfolio: 6.72%\n\nTrending:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nHis Apple sell-off is surprising, as Buffett has always been a huge fan of Tim Cook, Apple, and their products. We could hear him talking about how much he admires the company's loyal customer base. He even once said that people would give up their cars before they gave up their iPhones.\n\nBesides, the last time BH sold a large amount of Apple stocks, Charlie Munger, his longtime partner, told him, “That was probably a mistake.” So, why would he sell such a large portion of Apple shares now?\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Unlock a $400 billion opportunity by investing in the future of EV infrastructure on this startup already valued at $50 million.\n\nBuffett’s move to sell a big portion of Apple stock is similar to how he handled his investment in Coca-Cola. Years ago, he bought many Coca-Cola shares and has kept them for decades, even after the stock split. Now, he owns 400 million shares of both Apple and Coca-Cola, which has some people thinking that this number might mean he’s finished selling Apple and plans to keep it as a long-term part of his portfolio.\n\nInterestingly, even as Buffett was selling Apple, other big investors doubled down on the stock. For example, Jennison Associates, a firm managing over $200 billion, added more than 11 million Apple shares in the second quarter. William Jones Wealth Management also increased its Apple holdings by 35,000 shares. On the other hand, some firms, like Coatue Management and Cerity Partners, followed Buffett’s lead by reducing their Apple positions.\n\nWhatever the reason, Buffett's latest move with Apple stock again made one thing clear: when Warren Buffett makes a move, the market pays attention.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Is It A Sign?

        "title": "Amazon’s AI Spending Plans Keep Stock From Joining Tech Rebound",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- More than any of the megacap technology stocks, Amazon.com Inc.’s big spending ways are coming at the expense of profits, and its shares are being punished as a result.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival ‘Train Lovers’ Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid Part of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks Climate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\n\nAmazon’s stock performance has lagged its megacap peers since its earnings report at the beginning of August, when the e-commerce giant signaled to investors that it would be prioritizing spending on artificial intelligence computing. The move is a shift back into investment mode after a period of cost cutting that led to a surge in profits and helped fuel a rally that’s seen the shares more than double from a late 2022 low.\n\n“Investors are worried that the increase in capital spending will impact cash flows,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC. Amazon shares tend to outperform when it’s focused on improving profitability, compared with when it’s boosting investments, Abate said.\n\nThe switch back to spending mode “has investors recognizing that the significant period of outperformance for the stock may be at least on pause if not over for a period of time,” Abate added. Amazon shares remain more than 3% below where they traded prior to the results, compared with a gain of about 4% for the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index over that span. Shares of Amazon were slightly lower in early trading Tuesday.\n\nThe worry that increased spending will crimp profitability is top-of-mind for investors, given that margin expansion was among key trends that lifted Amazon shares during a run of more than 30% to a peak in early July. Daniel Kurnos at Benchmark sees that positive momentum now potentially at risk.\n\n“A confluence of particular timing of events could conspire to put incremental downward pressure on margins for the next couple of quarters,” according to Kurnos. This could also put a “sharper focus back on the top line at a time when the macro appears to be unstable at best,” he wrote in an Aug. 2 note.\n\nThe “macro” affects Amazon differently to its megacap tech peers because of the company’s mix of offerings. The combination of retail, video streaming and film and television businesses sets it apart and also brings varying exposure to developments in the broader economy. While the AWS cloud unit remains a bright spot, a weaker US consumer could drag on retail.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It seems like investors are waiting on the sidelines to get more information on the consumer,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC. “That’s probably why it’s lagged relative to some of the other peers.”\n\nInvestors may also be growing weary of Amazon’s rising cash pile and history of not returning it to shareholders. The company is one of the only megacap technology firms that doesn’t have a dividend. It has also been much less generous than its big tech cohort when it comes to buybacks.\n\nWhile the rest of its peers have approved tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in repurchases, Amazon’s $10 billion buyback program, which it approved in 2022, was less than half complete at the end of June. The company didn’t complete any share repurchases in the last quarter.\n\nPressure to compete for investor capital may be even higher for Amazon now that Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have all added dividends on top of their buybacks, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak wrote in an Aug. 18 note.\n\nThat leaves Amazon alongside only Tesla Inc. among tech megacaps without “an impactful capital return policy,” Nowak wrote. “If nothing changes by year end ‘25 we estimate AMZN’s net cash balance will make up ~8% of its total market cap.” That would rank it second-highest among the top-25 S&P 500 companies by market value, he added. “In our view a sustained capital return policy would likely lead to a higher multiple on AMZN’s cash flow.”\n\nStill, there are signs investors are stepping back into beaten-down technology shares, buying the dip in Amazon as well as Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. Amazon’s stock is up about 11% from the most recent trough on Aug. 5.\n\nThe latest downturn in its shares took Amazon’s valuation to about 28 times forward earnings, a discount to most of the so-called Magnificent Seven — only Alphabet has a lower multiple. It’s also at only a slight premium to the Nasdaq 100 index, which trades at about 26 times future earnings.\n\n“People have muscle memory and the winning trade for most people has been to use any dip in the Magnificent Seven as a buying opportunity,” said Abate. “And, you know, until that doesn’t work anymore, people are gonna continue to do it.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nEdgar Bronfman Jr. has formally submitted a $4.3 billion bid to take control of Paramount Global and quash an existing offer from Skydance Media, according to a person familiar with the proposal. Apple Inc. will make the most expensive iPhone Pro and Pro Max models in India for the first time this year, a milestone for the US company and the Asian country’s manufacturing sector. A Chinese-made game backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. has become the fourth most popular title ever on Steam within hours of its launch, an unusually rapid ascent that may help seal its place in industry lore. Battery maker Northvolt AB told employees at a subsidiary in San Francisco to reapply for jobs within the group after deciding to move its R&D efforts from California to Sweden.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nKingsoft Cloud Postmarket\n\nKeysight\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein, Subrat Patnaik and Rheaa Rao.\n\n(Updates stock moves at market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘I’m So Scared’: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport Where All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes Inside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem Sports Betting Is Legal, and Sportswriting Might Never Recover\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "It Isn't Just Apple: Warren Buffett Could Be Souring on This Other Megacap Stock",
        "content": "We recently got a look at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) massive stock portfolio, as it stood at the end of the second quarter. And the biggest move was one we already knew about: Berkshire's quarterly report indicated that the conglomerate had sold nearly half of its 12-figure Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) investment.\n\nIn addition to Apple, Berkshire sold quite a few other stocks, such as its entire position in software company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) and about one-fourth of its investment in Capital One Financial(NYSE: COF).\n\nHowever, there was one other stock-related move Berkshire made during the quarter, and it isn't anywhere to be found in the company's closely watched portfolio.\n\nBerkshire's buyback slowed dramatically in Q2\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway spent about $2.6 billion on share repurchases, or buybacks. In the second quarter, the company spent just $0.3 billion. That's a big slowdown.\n\nBerkshire breaks down its buyback activity month by month in its quarterly reports, so here are the details of this year's repurchases.\n\nMonth  Amount Berkshire Spent on Buybacks Average Price Paid (Class B Share Equivalent) January $479.1 million $370.08 February $1.829 billion $414.12 March $264.2 million $415.47 April $282.5 million $413.87 May $62.7 million $417.79 June $0 N/A\n\nData source: Berkshire Hathaway quarterly reports. Average share price is calculated as one class A share equals 1,500 class B shares.\n\nDoes Buffett think Berkshire is too expensive?\n\nFirst, Berkshire's buyback plan has two main conditions that must be met before any share repurchases can take place.\n\nThe company cannot be left with less than $30 billion in cash and short-term investments after the buybacks occur. Berkshire has $277 billion on its balance sheet, and has had a 12-figure sum for a long time, so this has yet to be an obstacle. Warren Buffett must believe that Berkshire trades for less than its intrinsic value, using a conservative analysis. It used to require him and vice chairman Charlie Munger, who passed away last year, to agree.\n\nSo, to be perfectly clear, if Berkshire is buying back any stock at all, it means that Buffett thinks it's still cheap. With the exception of June, when no buybacks occurred whatsoever, Buffett clearly believed Berkshire was trading for less than the true value of the company.\n\nInterestingly, for much of June, Berkshire's stock price was lower than the average price it paid to buy back shares in May, and even in February, which was by far the most active month of the year for buybacks. But if Berkshire's other stock market moves, such as the massive Apple sale, are any indication, Buffett may be taking a more cautious approach to capital allocation for the time being.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway trades for about $444 per share, which is significantly higher than any price Buffett and his team have paid to buy back shares throughout its history. In other words, Berkshire has never traded at a price this high, other than in the past few weeks, so we won't know if Buffett thinks the current price is a good value until we see Berkshire's buyback activity, or lack thereof, for the third quarter.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWhen the economic cycle actually turns, the biggest drivers of the stock market will change.\n\nAn obvious statement, perhaps. But the current market rebound is being led by the same handful of Big Tech winners that have dominated both returns and the market conversation since 2023.\n\nAnd until these terms and conditions change, this remains the AI moment.\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, strategists at Bank of America led by Michael Hartnett looked at the 10 largest companies in the world at four distinct points this century — March 2000, November 2007, March 2009, and November 2021 — plus the end of July of this year.\n\nThese dates represent, respectively: the top of the market before the tech bust, the top before the financial crisis, the bottom of the financial crisis, and the market's highs reached after the pandemic. And today, global stocks are trading at basically record levels.\n\nIn this exercise, BofA teases out two key features of any market always worth keeping in mind for investors — composition and concentration.\n\nOn the first, investors need to remember that the names we view as market leaders are always changing. And when the cycle really does change, so too will the market's leaders.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), for instance, is the only company to rank among the world's largest 10 companies at each of these checkpoints over the last nearly 25 years. In fact, Microsoft is the only company currently in the top 10 to rank on any of the three dates before 2021. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Seattle Convention Center Summit Building in Seattle, Washington, on May 21, 2024. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nIn reading this note, we were reminded of the exercise Warren Buffett did at the top of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting back in 2021, when he looked at how the world's 20 biggest companies had changed over the prior 30 years.\n\n\"It is a reminder of what extraordinary things can happen,\" Buffett said back in 2021. \"The world can change, and [in] very, very dramatic ways.\"\n\nSince 2009, there's been 90% turnover among the world's 10 biggest companies. Fifteen years ago, there were four companies from China in the top 10. Today, there are none.\n\nApple (AAPL), currently the world's largest company, didn't appear on BofA's rankings until its 2021 edition. (In 2014, Apple was the world's largest company; by 2018, it had become the first US company to see its market value cross $1 trillion.)\n\nOf course, had BofA chosen to select an intermediate date between 2009 and 2021 — say, the stock market's high in the summer of 2015 that wouldn't be overtaken for a year — the list wouldn't be quite as dramatically different: Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) would all feature in the rankings. But still, those would be the only three holdovers from nine years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcentration in the stock market has also changed dramatically over time. In 2009, the top 10 companies in the world accounted for about 10% of global market cap; today, that ratio is closer to 25%.\n\nLooking at 2000, 2007, and 2021, however, we see concentration looks more similar — though still less extreme — than today. The world's 10 biggest companies accounted for 17%, 11.6%, and 21.2% of global market in each of those years, respectively.\n\nSo not only has the market become significantly more tech-forward and US-centric, but also more concentrated.\n\nWhether an investor sees these past and present states of play as good, bad, or indifferent is what makes a market. The numbers simply tell us what is.\n\nBut that only Microsoft has maintained its place among the global elite over the last quarter century tells us what is most likely to happen over the next 25 years.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\n\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\n\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\n\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. Even though AI power on mobile devices is often a hot subject around Wall Street, the increased capabilities of personal computers and laptops running AI is often under-discussed. Recent analysis by global tech analytics firm Canalys reveals that the PC industry is on pace to ship 44 million AI-capable PCs in 2024. This would more than double to 103 million units in 2025. Apple is leading the market in this regard. The number of AI-powered PCs shipped during the second quarter of 2024 has hit close to 9 million. The AI PCs of Apple, named Mac, account for 60% of shipments, showcasing supremacy over rival Microsoft which shipped 39% of AI-capable PCs during the time.\n\nThe bullish sentiment around the tech giant is shared by experts on Wall Street. In a recent investor note, research analyst Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America maintained a Buy rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock with a price target of $256. The analyst even sought to allay fears regarding new EU rules, stressing that the firm appeared able to comply with the latest App Store link-out restrictions in the European Union as the Core Technology Fee would offset the lower App Store take rates required by the Digital Markets Act.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Investing.com - Jefferies analysts reaffirmed their \"Buy\" rating for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Sunday, despite ongoing antitrust concerns, following insights from a discussion with antitrust expert Glenn Manishin.\n\nAccording to Manishin, the likelihood of Alphabet facing a forced breakup or significant fines in its ongoing legal battles is minimal.\n\nManishin, a principal at ParadigmShift Law, brings a wealth of experience, having been counsel-of-record in landmark antitrust cases such as United States v. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and United States v. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHis insights provide valuable perspectives on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust case against Alphabet, particularly in regard to Google's ad tech platform and search business.\n\nAccording to Manishin, Alphabet is not expected to undergo a forced breakup or face major fines. Unlike the divestiture of AT&T's Bell Systems in 1982, such drastic measures are unlikely in this case.\n\nThe last forced divestiture was that of Standard Oil in 1911. Furthermore, the US Government lacks the authority to impose significant fines on antitrust violators, contrary to practices in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe antitrust case could take a long time to resolve, potentially spanning three to eight years. Manishin anticipates that the judge will take nine to eighteen months to propose remedies, after which Alphabet would likely appeal.\n\nThis appeal process would benefit from several factors, including rising AI competition, potential changes in administration, and historical legal theories that do not view capital as a barrier to entry.\n\nAlphabet's network effects are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating risks. Manishin draws a parallel to Microsoft's historical strategy of paying OEMs to preinstall Windows, leading to enduring network benefits even after such payments ceased.\n\nSimilarly, even if the judge bans payments from Alphabet to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to be the exclusive search provider, Alphabet's strong network effects could ensure it remains the search engine of choice, potentially leading to margin benefits.\n\nManishin posits that Google's advertising platform case, which is set to commence on September 9th in the Eastern District of Virginia, could have more significant financial implications than the current search-focused DOJ case.\n\nThe judge in this case might order behavioral remedies or even mandate a spin-off of the ad-tech business from the search business, thereby reducing Alphabet's dominance in the ad tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nStock Valuation and Outlook\n\nDespite the legal challenges, Jefferies analysts find Alphabet's current stock valuation attractive. Over the past month, Alphabet's stock has dropped 8%, compared to a 1% decline in the NASDAQ Composite (COMP).\n\nThe stock trades at an 11.6x forecasted CY25 enterprise value to EBITDA ratio, which is favorable compared to its 10-year near-term mean average of 12x.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies analysts maintain 'Buy' on Alphabet despite antitrust risks\n\nPilgrimâ€™s Pride in $100 million settlement over chicken farmers' pay\n\nB.

        "content": "Speculation about what Apple fans could potentially see in the next iteration of the company’s iPhone lineup has been ramping up as September closes in.\n\nSeptember is the month in which Apple, run by CEO Tim Cook, often holds an event to introduce its newest iPhone models and offer details about their features.\n\nThe tech giant hasn’t officially announced a date for the iPhone 16’s unveiling so far; however, some recent reports say the event could be slated for around Sept. 10.

For the Pro Max, it reportedly could be 6.86-inches.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nInside, the expected four-model lineup of iPhone 16s will contain A18 chips meant to provide more processing, per MacRumors. Bloomberg also reported Apple is building such chips into the iPhone 16s.\n\nThe tech giant’s current iPhone 15 slate — which consists of the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max — relies on two types of chips. The former two of the models come with the A16 Bionic, while the latter two operate with the A17 Pro, according to press releases.

It also has its Apple TV+ streaming platform and offers various services.\n\nThe most recent event that Apple has held was its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June.

With this \"new lower rate regime lower, the fall in yields isn't likely to carry the unequivocal 'risk on' signal for factor performance that they that they had during the 10 year yield’s decline from 5%.\"\n\nStill, there are some stocks that have shown to outperform whether a recession occurs or not in the midst of a rate-cutting cycle: stocks with a high buyback factor.\n\nEvercore ISI flagged a \"potential outperformers\" in the Russell 3000 group of stocks that boast a high factor for buybacks that will also be AI beneficiaries inclding Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhen the fed cuts rates, buy the buybacks: Evercore ISI\n\nJefferies analysts maintain 'Buy' on Alphabet despite antitrust risks\n\nUS overnight trading platform Blue Ocean completes fix for capacity issues\n\nView comments",

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nBTIG upgraded CareDx (CDNA) to Buy from Neutral with a $40 price target following the news last Friday afternoon that Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA decided it will not finalize the more restrictive proposed draft LCD issued in August 2023. Following Friday's update, the 2024 guidance and numbers look increasingly conservative and CareDx's legal matters seem to be manageable in light of Medicare's new approach, BTIG says. Gordon Haskett upgraded Burlington Stores(BURL) to Buy from Hold with a $300 price target as the firm is raising its Q2 comp growth estimate to 4.0% from 2.0% previously ahead of the company's earnings print. The firm, which expects Burlington's 2.0 Strategy to drive improved comps and margins in the years ahead, notes that quarter-to-date traffic through the first two weeks of Q3 has stayed strong and with a very favorable weather backdrop. BTIG upgraded Taylor Morrison(TMHC) to Buy from Neutral with a $78 price target after hosting investor meetings with management last week. The firm cites valuation for the upgrade, and says it has increased confidence in the roadmap for how Taylor Morrison gets to its long-term structural goals beyond the next 12 months. Loop Capital upgraded Prog Holdings(PRG) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $55, up from $41, implying 26% upside from current levels. The firm is encouraged by the \"proactive steps\" management has been taking recently to reaccelerate volume growth, including co-branded marketing programs and improved e-commerce checkout integration with existing retail partners and reinvigorating its regional small business. RBC Capital upgraded Gates Industrial(GTES) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $22, up from $20. The analyst believes the company's cost savings and footprint optimization will drive margin upside.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded HP Inc.(HPQ) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $37. The analyst now sees limited upside to the stock's valuation and consensus estimates. Piper Sandler downgraded Shake Shack(SHAK) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $114, down from $121. Coming out of earnings season, the firm is tempering its view on the fast casual sub-sector and for Shake Shack in particular the firm thinks the risk-reward has become more balanced at current levels. Benchmark downgraded Codexis(CDXS) to Hold from Buy with no price target. The firm cites negative quarterly earnings comparisons and the extended period of time before the company's long-range projects mature and begin to create more positive growth metrics. Piper Sandler downgraded Sweetgreen(SG) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $39, up from $33. Sweetgreen's Infinite Kitchen technology \"remains incredibly encouraging, and is arguably still underappreciated by many in the investment community,\" but the firm thinks the stock's risk/reward has become more balanced at current share levels. Morgan Stanley downgraded Hamilton Insurance(HG) to Equal Weight from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $19. With the stock above the firm's price target of $19, the firm believes the upside from here is more limited.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of Lineage(LINE) with a Buy rating and $105 price target. The analyst expects the company's earnings growth will be driven by a re-acceleration in same store operating income growth due to increased demand and a return to more normal seasonality in 2025 and 2026 while cost saving initiatives are realized. Lineage was also initiated at several other firms, including JPMorgan, Mizuho, Baird, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Concentra(CON) with an Overweight rating and $27 price target. Wells sees Concentra's growth/risk profile as the dominant player in occupational health and strong value for customers as more than offsetting current economic risks, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Concentra was also initiated at JPMorgan, Truist, Mizuho and Goldman Sachs. JPMorgan initiated coverage of OneStream(OS) with an Overweight rating and $30 price target. The firm likes the company's customer \"stickiness,\" with 98% gross retention on par with ServiceNow, and organic platform, which it believes creates a foundation for rapid enhancement. OneStream was also initiated at BTIG, Citi, Morgan Stanley, and Wolfe Research, among other firms. MoffettNathanson initiated coverage of Apple(AAPL) with a Neutral rating and $211 price target. The \"good news\" is that Apple is \"poised to win in AI,\" but the \"bad news\" is that is \"exactly what's already priced in,\" the analyst tells investors in the firm's initiation note. Barclays initiated coverage of Heico(HEI) with an Equal Weight rating and $250 price target. The analyst expects the company's relative growth to moderate as the aerospace aftermarket decelerates.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Dividend growth stocks have a long history of outperforming most other asset classes. Companies that consistently boost their dividends generally have exceptional free cash flows, strong balance sheets, and exhibit above-average revenue growth. On top of all that, regular increases to the dividend can create a snowball effect for long-term investors, compounding returns over time when the dividend is reinvested.\n\nWhich dividend growth stocks scan as top buys for long-term investors? The following five blue-chip dividend payers all sport exceptional dividend growth rates and superb fundamentals. Here is a rundown of their most compelling attributes and why they might make an outstanding addition to a well-rounded portfolio. Image Source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL), the tech giant known for its innovative products like the iPhone and Mac computers, has become a fantastic dividend growth stock in recent years. The company's strong brand, loyal customer base, and expanding services segment provide a solid foundation for future growth.\n\nApple's current yield of 0.45% may seem low, but its three-year dividend growth rate of 2.81% and low payout ratio of 14.7% indicate significant room for future increases. The company's robust operating cash flow of $110.5 billion in 2023 underscores its ability to fund dividend growth while investing in its diverse range of businesses.\n\nApple's combination of a strong balance sheet, consistent free cash flow generation, and low payout ratio makes it an attractive option for dividend growth investors. The company's continued innovation in hardware and expansion in services provide multiple avenues for future growth, supporting the potential for sustained dividend increases.\n\n2. ExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM), one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas companies, has a long history of dividend payments and increases. The company's diverse operations across the energy value chain provide stability and cash flow to support its dividend policy.\n\nExxonMobil offers a yield of 3.2% and a three-year dividend growth rate of 2.58%, providing an attractive combination of current income and growth. The payout ratio of 44.9% and operating cash flow of $55.3 billion in 2023 indicate the dividend is well covered by current operations.\n\nExxonMobil's strong position in the energy sector, coupled with its focus on cost reduction and efficiency improvements, makes it a compelling choice for dividend growth investors. The company's investments in low-carbon solutions also position it well for the ongoing energy transition to battle climate change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic (NYSE: MDT), a global leader in medical technology, offers a wide range of products and therapies. The company's focus on innovation and expanding presence in emerging markets provide multiple avenues for long-term growth.\n\nMedtronic offers a hefty yield of 3.43% with a three-year dividend growth rate of 0.97%. That said, the payout ratio of 100% raises some concerns on the sustainability side of the ledger. However, the company's substantial operating cash flow of $6.04 billion in 2023 provides some reassurance about the sustainability of its quarterly payouts.\n\nMedtronic's strong market position in various medical technology segments and its focus on research and development support its long-term growth prospects. The company's commitment to its dividend, despite recent challenges, makes it an interesting option for income-focused investors.\n\n4. Johnson & Johnson\n\nJohnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), a diversified healthcare company, operates in the high-growth pharmaceutical and medical device arenas. The company's broad portfolio and strong brand recognition provide stability and a wide range of growth opportunities.\n\nJ&J offers a yield of 3.12% and a three-year dividend growth rate of 3.1%, providing a balanced mix of current income and growth. The payout ratio of 72.7% is manageable for a diversified healthcare company. After all, J&J raked in a healthy $22.8 billion in operating cash flow in 2023.\n\nJ&J's diverse business model, strong financial position, and consistent dividend growth make it an attractive option for conservative dividend growth investors. The company's focus on innovation and value-creating strategic acquisitions should support future growth and additional increases to the dividend.\n\n5. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO), a global leader in the beverage industry, boasts a portfolio of over 200 brands. The company's strong distribution network and marketing capabilities provide a noteworthy competitive advantage.\n\nCoca-Cola offers a yield of 2.83% with a three-year dividend growth rate of 3.29%. The payout ratio of 76.8% is on the higher side, but the dividend is supported by over $11.5 billion in operating cash flow on an annualized basis.\n\nCoca-Cola's strong brand portfolio, global presence, and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences position it well for future growth. The company's consistent dividend growth record and ongoing efforts to improve efficiency make it an appealing choice for dividend-focused investors.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThese five dividend growth stocks offer an attractive mix of current yield, growth potential, and financial stability. Moreover, they represent diverse sectors, a feature that could aid in portfolio diversification. Best of all, these blue-chip dividend growers are proven wealth escalators, thanks to their top-tier dividend programs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

It is the most important component of the iPhone after the main processor and it is difficult to make, Gurman said.\n\nThe Apple specialist is of the view that it is tough to replace Qualcomm’s modem chips as they are already state-of-the-art and that they have been “battle-tested by phone carriers around the world, making them highly reliable.”  Johny Srouji, who runs the hardware team at Apple, said in a CNBC interview that it's unlikely that any upgrades Apple makes to the part will result in a better experience for users and that developing a modem was “extremely difficult to do.”\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFallout & Patchup: Apple decided to take up modem chip manufacturing in 2018 when it faced a legal battle with Qualcomm over royalties and patents. The two parties reached a settlement a year later, agreeing to dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide.\n\nApple agreed to make a payment to Qualcomm and the two also signed a six-year license agreement, effective as of April 1, 2019, including a two-year option to extend, and a multiyear chipset supply agreement.\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nApple Persists: Despite the pushbacks, Apple is pushing ahead, said Gurman, adding that the company has earmarked “billions of dollars, thousands of engineers and millions of working hours to a project that won't really improve its devices — at least at the outset.”\n\nStory continues\n\nSome Apple insiders are resigned to the fact that customers don’t care about whether the modem used in their phones are made in-house or outsourced. Taking modem manufacturing in-house could help make the marketing pitch that most important iPhone components are made in-house but user experience won’t noticeably change, said Gurman.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nAlso Gurman noted that Apple’s modem project suffered numerous setbacks over the past few years. These include issues with performance and overheating and delay in launch time at least until next year, he said. The columnist said Apple extending the supplier agreement with Qualcomm through March 2027 is due to its plan for a gradual rollout of the in-house modem chips, starting with niche models.\n\nOne of the reasons for moving to an in-house modem is to save money, given Apple has argued that Qualcomm charges too much for it, Gurman said. Even after the move, Apple may still have to cough up some amount as royalties to Qualcomm, he added.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nLong term, Apple could be benefited, as the tech giant plans to fold its modem design into “a new wireless chip that handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access,” Gurman said. “That would create a single connectivity component, potentially improving reliability and battery life.” He also sees the possibility of Apple one day combiningg all of this into the device's main system on a chip, or SoC.\n\nThis, according to Gurman, could further cut costs and save space inside the iPhone, allowing for more design choices.\n\n“The best-case scenario is that it all goes smoothly, and most customers aren't even aware of the switch. But the project's real worth won't be tested until years later — when, Apple hopes, it sets the stage for a better iPhone,” he said.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDuring market downturns, investors are learning that unlike equities, these high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% are protected by resilient assets, buffering against losses.

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Are you looking for quality stocks that are easy and rewarding to own for the long haul? Why not start -- and maybe even finish -- your hunt with the 30 names that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average? They're all established blue chips, after all, hand-picked largely because of their resilience.\n\nTo this end, here's a closer look at three of the Dow's best bets right now simply because they're poised to rally during the remainder of this year and into the indefinite future.\n\n1. Apple\n\nFor years Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was such a frequently suggested stock pick that it almost become cliché, albeit for good reason. The organization is not only the world's biggest publicly traded company as measured by market cap, but it's also regularly the world's most profitable. Apple also earned all of that growth, leveraging the wild popularity of its iPhone.\n\nThe iPhone hasn't been much of a growth engine lately, of course. Between market saturation, consumer inflation, and improving competition, revenue stemming from sales of the smartphone has been stagnant since 2021. Total iPhone deliveries have also been flat for nearly a decade now. The bulk of any top-line and bottom-line growth the company has achieved during this stretch has actually been from digital services like apps, music, and video entertainment.\n\nSomething happened just a few weeks ago, however, that could prove game-changing for Apple for a long, long time. In June, it introduced what it's calling Apple Intelligence, which turns its newest and more powerful smartphones into full-blown mobile AI devices. More to the point, Apple devices powered by its in-house-designed M-series and A17 Pro processors (or better, presumably) will be able to handle heavy-duty generative artificial intelligence tasks directly from the device rather than punting that work to the cloud.\n\nInvestors and consumers alike are excited. After all, in many ways this is the AI tool the world's been waiting on. Apple shares are up more than 30% from the April low largely due to this development.\n\nThe market may still underestimate just how big of a deal onboard artificial intelligence could be for Apple, though. Technology market research outfit IDC believes generative AI smart shipments will grow at an average annual pace of more than 78% through 2028, with more than 900 million of these devices likely to be purchased that year.\n\nGiven that Apple is already the premier name in the smartphone space, it's apt to capture more than its fair share of this growth. Of course, more iPhones being in consumers' hands means more services revenue as well. This is also much higher-margin revenue than device revenue could ever be.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. PepsiCo\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a common go-to pick for income-minded investors, and understandably so. Everyone knows its brands, and the company has raised its dividend payment every year for the past 62 years.\n\nIf you're looking for a dividend-paying Dow stock with room and reason to soar soon and for a while, however, consider taking on a stake in beverage rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) instead. Whereas Coca-Cola shares are well into record-high territory thanks to years of mostly uninterrupted bullishness, PepsiCo shares are priced right around where they were in late 2021.\n\nHowever, don't you want to own an industry's strongest-performing stock? Generally speaking, yes, you do. The reasons for that leading performance should be clear and reasonable, though. In this case, they aren't.\n\nAlthough Coca-Cola may be a leading name in several different categories of beverages, it's not necessarily a better investment than PepsiCo is. PepsiCo's dividend has been grown at a faster pace than Coke's has for many years now, for instance. It's also technically cheaper than Coke's stock currently is, priced at only 21 times its projected per-share earnings versus Coca-Cola's comparable multiple of 24. PepsiCo's forward-looking dividend yield of 3.1% is also better than Coke's 2.8%.\n\nSo, why are investors still filing into the more expensive and less rewarding ticker when they could own the cheaper, higher-yielding option instead? Habit, mostly. The Coca-Cola Company has been such a reliable winner for decades that investors often buy it without giving it any thought or without considering its valuation or yield. The market doesn't quite have the same history-driven affinity for PepsiCo.\n\nGive it time, though. Investors eventually figure things out. They'll realize soon enough that PepsiCo shares are undervalued compared to the next-nearest alternative.\n\n3. Nike\n\nFinally, it's been a tough past few years for athletic apparel brand Nike(NYSE: NKE). The company began turning up the heat on its own direct-to-consumer business just a few years back, alienating many of its third-party retailing partners. As it turns out, though, Nike can't do quite as much on its own as it initially thought it could.\n\nThe pandemic also broke its supply chains, causing a costly swell in inventory levels. There's also no denying that many of the company's recent athletic sneaker designs just haven't resonated all that well with consumers, who are increasingly looking for more practical -- even if pricier -- athletic shoes from brands like Hoka or On.\n\nThese are all reasons why Nike stock has been more than halved since its late-2021 peak. This steep sell-off, however, is more of an opportunity than a warning of what's to come. In short, Nike CEO John Donahoe knows what needs to be done to fix the company -- and he's doing it.\n\nOne of these initiatives is a full restoration of its once-important wholesaling to retailers like Foot Locker. Last quarter's 5% year-over-year improvement in wholesale revenue is solid progress, but the recent rehiring of former executive Tom Peddie specifically to grow this business speaks volumes about Nike's longer-term ambitions.\n\nDonahoe is also ramping up effective innovation. Although the company technically never stopped innovating, it did lose its touch on this front. In April of this year, however, it unveiled the Nike Pegasus Premium running shoe, adding that its debut \"signaled a multiyear innovation cycle\" that will utilize the \"full power of digital capabilities and cutting-edge technology.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly what that means. However, it is clear that Nike realizes it needs to do more than it's been doing. Better yet (and recent challenges aside), it's doing this work with the advantage of being one of the world's premier brand names in athletic apparel.\n\nIt's tempting to wait and see if Nike stock can begin a clear long-term recovery. Waiting for such confirmation, however, could mean a major missed opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Next Artificial Intelligence (AI) Chipmaker Stock to Join Nvidia in the Trillion-Dollar Club (Hint: It's Not Broadcom)",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen its share price soar on the back of huge artificial intelligence (AI)-related spending from big tech companies. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are essential infrastructure for training large language models, the backbone of generative AI. As more and more companies invest in the frontier of AI development, Nvidia has been a big beneficiary.\n\nThe chipmaker joined the $1 trillion club last summer and passed a $2 trillion valuation in February. After a brief foray into the $3 trillion territory, the stock sits just below that threshold as of this writing.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only chipmaker riding the tidal wave of AI spending. Several others have seen big boosts to their business as a result of the requisite data center build-outs, including Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Broadcom's networking and AI accelerator chips have proven increasingly valuable as data centers rapidly expand. Both help big tech companies get the most from their investments and have propelled the chipmaker to a $750 billion valuation.\n\nThe next semiconductor stock to join Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club won't be Broadcom, though. Investors should look up the supply chain to find the next chipmaker to exceed a $1 trillion valuation: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(NYSE: TSM). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis company wins when chipmakers compete\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the largest chip fabricator in the world. It accounts for roughly 60% of all foundry spending, and there's a good reason: It has the most advanced chip manufacturing processes in the world. That allows it to make more powerful and power-efficient chips for its customers. Both areas are extremely important for AI and other areas, such as smartphones.\n\nImportantly, it's unlikely TSMC's next-closest competitor will be able to unseat the company from its position. TSMC's scale is a massive advantage. With so much revenue coming in, it's able to invest more in research and development. That ensures it remains at the leading edge of manufacturing processes.\n\nBig customers, including Nvidia, Broadcom, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and others contract with TSMC to produce the chips they design for sale and for use in their products. Almost anyone who wants to compete with those companies likely contracts with TSMC as well. So, even if Nvidia or Broadcom start losing market share to a competitor, TSMC is unlikely to lose business overall. In fact, competition for TSMC's limited resources is great for its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's seen in its most recent financial reporting. TSMC set a new monthly revenue record in July when it brought in 257 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$8 billion). That's a 45% year-over-year increase for the month. Last quarter, the company saw revenue grow 40% (33% in USD) and net income grow 36%. Two-thirds of its revenue came from its most advanced chip processes.\n\nThere's a lot more growth in the pipeline\n\nTSMC should continue to benefit from several catalysts over the next few years. That starts with management's outlook for the third quarter.\n\nIt expects $22.4 billion to $23.2 billion in revenue for the quarter, and it's already ahead of pace with its July sales. At its midpoint, the outlook represents 32% year-over-year growth. Moreover, it expects gross margin to expand to between 53.5% and 55.5%. That suggests the company is exhibiting pricing power amid growing customer demand.\n\nThat demand should keep growing as big tech companies share plans to spend heavily on AI server capacity. Meta Platforms said it expects significant capital expenditures (capex) growth in 2025, even as it sets new records for capex this year. Likewise, Alphabet's management said the cost of overspending is far less than the cost of under-investing in AI, so investors should expect considerable capital investments there as well. Similar sentiments are echoed throughout the tech space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMany investors are expecting strong results from the next Apple iPhone release, which will include support for new Apple AI features. Many existing iPhone users will be unable to use the latest AI capabilities offered by Apple due to hardware restrictions, which could spur a significant round of upgrades over the next year. Strong iPhone demand will mean strong demand for TSMC's chips.\n\nTSMC is preparing for the increased demand. It narrowed its capex forecast for the year to between $30 billion and $32 billion, increasing the low end from $28 billion. The increased spending outlook came with this comment from management: \"At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with the higher growth opportunities in the following years.\"\n\nThe stock has room to rise\n\nDespite TSMC's $875 billion market cap, the stock looks undervalued at today's price. Shares currently trade for a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 26.5. Meanwhile, strong revenue growth and margin expansion can support earnings growth above 20% per year for the foreseeable future. Analysts currently expect 21.5% earnings growth per year over the next five years.\n\nThat makes TSMC one of the most attractive AI chipmaker stocks on the market. It currently sits about 14% away from the trillion-dollar club, so it shouldn't be long before it reaches the milestone.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Are All 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling",
        "content": "When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett buys or sells shares of a company, professional and everyday investors pay close attention. That's because the aptly dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has nearly doubled-up the annualized total return of the benchmark S&P 500 since becoming CEO in 1965. This near-doubling in annualized total return spanning almost six decades works out to an aggregate increase in Berkshire's Class A shares of 5,347,200%, as of the closing bell on Aug. 15.\n\nEven though Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding amazing deals hiding in plain sight. Thus, riding his coattails has been a fruitful investment strategy for decades.\n\nBut it's just as important to know when to sell as it is to understand what stocks to buy. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nLast week, Form 13Fs were filed by institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. A 13F provides a concise snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest and most-successful money managers have been buying and selling.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 13F revealed record selling activity for the Oracle of Omaha and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. This trio has overseen seven consecutive quarters of net-equity security sales, with more than $75 billion in net-equity sales during the June-ended quarter.\n\nWhat follows are the 10 stocks Warren Buffett was a seller of during the second quarter.\n\n1. Apple: Sold 389,368,450 shares (reduced stake by 49.33%)\n\nThe jaw-dropper of Berkshire Hathaway's 13F, which was technically given away earlier this month by the release of the company's second-quarter operating results, was the nearly 50% reduction in top holding Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAlthough Buffett has been unwavering in his love for Apple as a business, and absolutely appreciates its historic capital-return program, he opined during his company's annual shareholder meeting in May that corporate tax rates were liable to climb in the future. With Berkshire Hathaway sitting on enormous unrealized gains from its stake in Apple, Buffett hinted that investors would, in hindsight, appreciate his company locking in these gains at a relatively lower tax rate.\n\nEven after selling more than 389 million shares of Apple, it still accounts for about 29% of Berkshire's invested assets.\n\n2. Paramount Global: Sold entire stake (7,531,765 shares)\n\nCompletely exiting Berkshire's stake in media stock Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA) comes as no surprise. During the same annual shareholder meeting where Buffett ventured a guess that corporate tax rates would climb, he noted that he (and he alone) had disposed of the remaining 7.5 million shares of Paramount that had been held, as of March 31 -- and at a sizable loss!\n\nStory continues\n\nLike most legacy media companies, Paramount has had to shift its focus to streaming options as cable cord-cutting accelerates. Unfortunately, building out a streaming content library has proved challenging and weighed down the company's operating results.\n\nParamount is one of those rare misses for the Oracle of Omaha.\n\n3. Snowflake: Sold entire stake (6,125,376 shares)\n\nOne of the biggest surprises from 13F season is the complete disposition of Berkshire's stake in cloud data-warehousing company Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW).\n\nLet's be crystal clear: This was not a Buffett buy. I'd venture a guess that Buffett doesn't understand the first thing about cloud data-warehousing. Rather, it was likely Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler making the call to exit this stake, which was entered at Snowflake's initial public offering (IPO) price four years ago.\n\nAlthough Snowflake possesses clear-cut competitive advantages, its growth rate has slowed meaningfully since its IPO, and its valuation has remained lofty. With the stock market historically pricey, Snowflake is a candidate to get clobbered if the Nasdaq Composite rolls over. WTI Crude Oil Spot Price Chart\n\n4. Chevron: Sold 4,369,673 shares (reduced stake by 3.55%)\n\nFor a second consecutive quarter, Buffett and his crew modestly reduced their company's stake in oil and gas goliath Chevron(NYSE: CVX).\n\nSince this century began, energy stocks have often played a minimal role for Berkshire's investment portfolio. But with Buffett and his crew steadily building up Berkshire's stake in Occidental Petroleum, which was described as an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's latest annual letter to shareholders, we may be witnessing corresponding reductions in the Chevron stake. In other words, Berkshire's brightest investment minds may not want any additional oil and gas exposure as they increase their stake in Occidental.\n\nHowever, with macro factors generally supportive of a higher spot price for crude oil, it would be surprising to see Buffett substantially reduce his company's stake in Chevron. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Capital One Financial: Sold 2,651,978 shares (reduced stake by 21.27%)\n\nPerhaps the most head-scratching move of all from Berkshire's 13F is the sale of 2.65 million shares of credit-services company Capital One Financial(NYSE: COF).\n\nBuffett is generally a huge fan of brand-name value stocks in the financial sector. Capital One shares can currently be scooped up for less than book value, and sport a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.6. It's a company that's taken advantage of the steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades.\n\nThe best guess I can offer as to why Buffett & Co. pared down their stake in Capital One is consumer credit card delinquency trends. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 7.18% of credit card debt was seriously delinquent (90 or more days) in the second quarter, up from 5.08% in the comparable quarter last year.\n\n6. Floor & Décor: Sold 802,130 shares (reduced stake by 16.78%)\n\nThe roughly 802,100-share reduction in Floor & Décor(NYSE: FND) has a similar feel to Snowflake in that it's probably more Combs' and Weschler's doing than Buffett's.\n\nFloor & Décor is a company that initially benefited from a rapid rise in interest rates. As mortgage rates soared, it set the stage for the company to reap the rewards of people choosing to stay in their existing homes and remodel.\n\nUnfortunately, the luster of this higher-rate environment has worn off. CEO Tom Taylor has cautioned that higher rates are negatively impacting discretionary spending on hard surface flooring, which has brought topline growth for Floor & Décor to a near-standstill. While management has levers it can pull to potentially boost its margins, its forward P/E of 51 can't be swept under the rug. US Existing Home Sales Chart\n\n7. Louisiana-Pacific: Sold 633,154 shares (reduced stake by 9.6%)\n\nWith the exception of Apple, Paramount, and Chevron, where Berkshire's operating results and/or comments from Buffett gave away that selling activity had occurred, I'd argue the easiest-to-predict reduction was siding solutions provider Louisiana-Pacific(NYSE: LPX).\n\nLast week, I postulated that Buffett and his investment aides would completely exit this stake given the expectation of a Fed rate-easing cycle beginning in September.\n\nWhen mortgage rates soared, it effectively froze the market for existing-home sales and opened the barn door for suppliers of homebuilders, like Louisiana-Pacific, to thrive. As mortgage rates decline, the sheen for homebuilders and their supplier will likely fade. TMUS Total Long Term Debt (Annual) Chart\n\n8. T-Mobile: Sold 570,000 shares (reduced stake by 10.87%)\n\nThe eighth stock Warren Buffett was a seller of in the June-ended quarter is telecom titan T-Mobile(NASDAQ: TMUS).\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has a bit of a checkered past with telecom companies and doesn't tend to hold onto them for extended periods. T-Mobile's once scorching-hot sales growth rate has certainly slowed in recent years, while its long-term debt has risen modestly since the pandemic.\n\nYet in spite of slowing topline growth, T-Mobile's earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow (FCF) are expanding considerably faster than other telecom companies. An all-time record $4.4 billion in second-quarter FCF might be enough to entice Buffet, Combs, and Weschler to stick around. LYV Chart\n\n9. and 10. Liberty Live Group: Sold 214,929 shares Series C (LLYV.K)(reduced stake by 1.93%) and sold 65,330 shares Series A (LLYV.A)(reduced stake by 1.29%)\n\nLast but not least, Warren Buffett and his investment team were sellers of Liberty Live Group(NASDAQ: LLYV.K)(NASDAQ: LLYV.A) during the second quarter. The reductions in both the Series A and C shares were minimal (below 2%), with Todd Combs or Ted Weschler probably behind this selling.\n\nLiberty Live Group is owned by Liberty Media and is effectively a tracking stock for Liberty Media's sizable stake in Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster. Since Berkshire received its stake in Liberty Live Group via spinoff, and neither Buffett, Combs, or Weschler initially purchased shares of this tracking stock, occasional selling and/or profit-taking isn't too surprising.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) is preparing to launch its fourth iPhone assembly unit in the country. The new plant, set up by Tata Electronics, is located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, and is expected to begin operations in November.\n\nWhat Happened: The iPhone assemble plant will be Tata's second in the country, Business Standard reported. The iPhone maker's first plant in the country was established following Tata's acquisition of Taiwan-based Wistron’s unit in Karnataka.\n\nThe Hosur plant, which spans 250 acres, will manufacture iPhones using components from a unit that Tata set up three years ago.\n\nTata Electronics is reportedly investing ₹6,000 crore in the new plant, matching the investment made in the components unit.\n\nThe facility is expected to employ over 50,000 workers, who are predominantly women. The assembly plant alone is set to add 35,000-40,000 jobs, making it the largest of its kind in India.\n\nDo you want to keep up with all the latest stock market updates in India?

The fourth factory will help the company achieve its goal of shifting 10% of global iPhone manufacturing capacity to India by 2025-26, taking advantage of the government’s production-linked incentive scheme.\n\nRead Next: Ola Electric Share Price Band Revised Downwards By Exchanges\n\nPhoto courtesy: Unsplash\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple To Expand Indian Footprint As Tata Sets Up Country's 4th iPhone Assembly Plant: Report originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Bull of the Day: Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT)",
        "content": "Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) stock has soared 150% during the last year to crush Meta, Amazon, Apple, and tons of other tech standouts. Spotify stock looks ready to break out to new all-time highs, even as SPOT’s valuation improves immensely.\n\nSpotify’s commitment to efficiency and profits, mixed with a string of price hikes and strong user growth are leading to booming earnings expansion and impressive revenue growth.\n\nThe streaming music powerhouse posted another blowout beat-and-raise quarter in late July that sent Spotify’s earnings outlook soaring even higher.\n\nSpotify Stock’s Bull Case\n\nSpotify was one of the pioneers of paid streaming music. The company forever altered the music industry the way Netflix changed TV and movies. Like Netflix (NFLX), Spotify’s success inspired challengers such as Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet to enter the streaming music space.\n\nDespite competition from the giants of tech, Spotify remains the king of streaming music. Spotify reportedly held 32% of the global streaming music market share in 2023, blowing away No. 2 Apple (AAPL) Music’s 15%, as well as YouTube’s (GOOGL) 14% and Amazon’s (AMZN) 13%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is thriving as users flock to the service for music, podcasts, and more recently, audiobooks. SPOT nearly doubled its revenue between 2019 and 2023. Spotify grew its Premium Subscribers by 80% between Q2 FY20 and Q2 FY24, while monthly active users surged 110%.\n\nSpotify is projected to grow its monthly active users by roughly 45% to 900 million by 2028, based on some Wall Street estimates. Spotify’s user growth expansion is key to helping it continue to negotiate favorable rights deals with artists.\n\nSpotify’s streaming service often becomes an essential aspect of its users’ daily lives, helping SPOT successfully raise its prices in back-to-back summers. Spotify in the summer of 2023 hiked its monthly prices for its ad-free Premium plans to match competitors such as Apple and Amazon. Fast forward to June 2024, and SPOT upped its prices again to help keep up with inflation and boost profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHigher interest rates sparked Spotify to focus on efficiency and the bottom line, much like Amazon and other former sales and user growth-over-everything-else tech firms. Spotify has cut down its workforce and rolled out other streamlining efforts.\n\nSpotify appears to have reached an inflection point on profits and cash flow growth.\n\nSpotify’s Recent Quarter and Growth Outlook\n\nSpotify boosted its gross margin by 510 bps to a record high of 29.2% in the second quarter. SPOT expanded its free cash flow to €490 million in Q2, up from €207 in the first quarter of 2024 and just €9 million in the year-ago period.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify grew its monthly active users by 14% YoY in the second quarter to 626 million, expanding its paid Premium Subscribers by 12% to 246 million. Spotify grew its revenue by 18% last quarter and swung from an adjusted loss of -$1.69 a share in the year-ago period to +$1.43, crushing our EPS estimate by 32%.\n\nSpotify boosted its outlook once again as its combination of price hikes, efficiency, and user growth lead to soaring earnings expansion. SPOT’s FY24 EPS estimate has surged 27% since its Q2 release, with its FY25 figure 21% higher.\n\nSPOT’s recent bottom-line revisions are part of an impressive trend that’s seen its FY24 EPS estimate skyrocket 940% over the last 12 months from $0.61 a share to its current $6.32, while its FY25 figure soared 280%. Spotify’s improving EPS estimates help SPOT stock land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$6.32 per share in 2024 and then surge 38% next year to $8.70 a share. Meanwhile, Zacks estimates call for SPOT to grow its revenue by 19% in 2024 and another 15% next year to climb from $14.33 billion in 2023 to $20 billion in FY25—doubling revenue between FY20 and FY25.\n\nSpotify expects to end the third quarter with 639 million monthly active users, marking 11% YoY growth.\n\nBreaking Down SPOT’s Performance, Technical Levels, and Valuation\n\nSpotify stock has soared 350% off its 2022 lows (around the stock market’s 2022 bottom), including an 80% YTD climb. SPOT crushed Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet during both of those periods. Despite its impressive run, Spotify trades around 8% below its 2021 peaks and 9% under its average Zacks price target.\n\nSpotify stock might be ready to finally break out to new all-time highs if it can build on its first-half momentum in terms of earnings expansion and beyond. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSPOT’s 21-day moving average has provided rather bullish support since the start of 2023. Spotify stock is also far from overheated, with it sitting at neutral levels in terms of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (bottom part of the nearby chart)—RSI is used to help determine if a stock or index is too expensive or too cheap based on its recent performance.\n\nSpotify trades at a 75% discount to its 12-month highs at 42.9X forward 12-month earnings. SPOT’s PEG ratio, which factors in the company’s long-term earnings growth outlook, marks a 60% discount to the Tech sector. In terms of forward sales, Spotify stock trades at a 43% discount to the Zacks Tech sector and 41% vs. SPOT’s highs. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTime to Buy Spotify Stock?\n\nSpotify forever reshaped the music industry as much as Netflix permanently changed Hollywood. SPOT’s valuation is improving as its profits boom. Now appears to be a good time to think about buying Spotify stock as SPOT attempts to reach new heights.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tim Cook Sees China's Future Bright For Apple – Describes China As 'The Most Competitive In The World'",
        "content": "Apple’s China sales just took a nose-dive. Revenue dropped to $14.73 billion last quarter, down 6.5% from last year. CEO Tim Cook is keeping his chin up about the future in China, but there’s a snag – Apple's new AI feature, Apple Intelligence, isn't launching there yet.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nChina, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, is Apple's third-biggest market. But this time around, it's the only one that slipped. Cook says currency swings are mostly to blame, with more than half the drop coming from foreign exchange rates. Strip that away, and the decline is actually under 3%. Still, Apple fell short of what analysts expected –$15.26 billion.\n\nSee Also:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nCook isn't waving the white flag. On a conference call with investors, he called China “the most competitive market in the world” and pointed to some good news, like a record number of iPhone upgrades in the June quarter. “That's a very strong signal,” he said, showing he's not ready to count Apple out yet.\n\nBut let's be real – the challenges are piling up for Apple. Even with deep discounts, Apple saw the iPhone slip out of the top five in China's smartphone rankings. That's a big deal. According to Canalys, iPhone shipments in China dropped 2% from last year, pushing Apple down to No. 6 among smartphone makers. It's the first time in years that Apple isn't in the top five in one of its most important markets.\n\nTrending:Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nThe road ahead? It's rocky. Apple is banking on its new AI features to spark fresh growth, but getting that tech into China is no small feat. Apple Intelligence, the shiny new AI, rolled out with iOS 18.1, but China didn't cut it.\n\nCook knows this is a sticking point. He said Apple is “very constructively engaged” with regulators in China and the EU. However, until Apple can jump through these regulatory hoops, Chinese users will be out of luck with Apple Intelligence. That leaves a big question about whether Apple can regain its footing in this all-important market.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis startup’s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing — Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.

They are collectively known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" It is worth noting that some of them, such as Nvidia, Meta, and Alphabet, have delivered stronger gains than the market in 2024.\n\nHowever, it won't be surprising to see Apple stock stepping on the gas in the closing stages of 2024 and eventually getting to the $4 trillion market cap milestone, which is 21% away from its current valuation.\n\nAI is likely to lift Apple's sales\n\nApple has yet to introduce artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smartphones as compared to rivals such as Samsung and other Chinese original equipment manufacturers that have already jumped on this bandwagon. However, that is likely to change next month when the company launches its next generation of iPhones, which are set to support the company's generative AI suite of features known as Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence in June this year, pointing out that this platform will be \"deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\" Apple Intelligence has a host of generative AI features that could trigger a new upgrade cycle, encouraging users on older devices to upgrade to the latest iPhones.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee believes that the next iPhone will kick off a new upgrade cycle that will last beyond Apple's 2025 iPhone generation. More specifically, the analyst estimates that Apple could see a 10% increase in iPhone unit sales in fiscal 2025 to 244 million units. Apple's fiscal 2025 will begin late next month and coincide with the launch of its AI-enabled iPhones.\n\nJ.P. Morgan sees iPhone sales rising to 268 million units in fiscal 2026, indicating that the upgrade cycle will intensify when the company updates its lineup next year. The good news for Apple investors is that the iPhone isn't the only device that's going to get a dose of AI injection. Apple Intelligence will be available on MacBooks as well.\n\nThese markets could unlock another solid growth opportunity for Apple. For instance, the generative AI personal computer (PC) market is expected to grow from annual shipments of 48 million units in 2024 to 205 million units in 2028. The addition of Apple Intelligence to the company's Mac operating system puts it in a nice position to take advantage of this secular growth opportunity in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this indicates that Apple could be at the beginning of a new growth curve that could eventually help the stock regain its mojo and head higher in the long run. However, a closer look at a recent sales number from Apple's key chip manufacturing partner indicates it won't be long before the tech giant attains a $4 trillion market cap.\n\nOne key sign that Apple is preparing for an aggressive AI-enabled iPhone rollout\n\nThe processors that power Apple's iPhones are manufactured by foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. Apple is said to be TSMC's largest customer, accounting for 25% of its top line last year. The tech giant is reportedly one of the companies to have fully booked the Taiwan-based company's supply of 3 nanometer (nm) chips.\n\nWith Apple's iPhone 16 models set to sport 3nm processors, it is not surprising to see rumors that the company has been ordering more chips from TSMC. Reports suggest that Apple's iPhone 16 production in 2024 could be 10% higher than the number of iPhone 15 models it produced in 2023. This is probably the reason why TSMC recently reported a terrific 45% year-over-year jump in its revenue for July.\n\nFor comparison, TSMC's July revenue was down almost 5% year over year in 2023. Of course, Apple may not have been the only customer to have driven TSMC's revenue growth last month. However, as the iPhone maker is TSMC's largest customer, there is a good chance that it has increased its chip orders in a bid to roll out its next-generation smartphone lineup aggressively.\n\nThat would be a smart thing to do as shipments of generative AI smartphones are forecast to increase a whopping 364% this year to 234 million units. As Apple's AI-capable iPhones will hit the market just in time for the holiday period, they could witness stronger-than-expected demand. As a result, Apple's growth in the final six months of 2024 could upstage Wall Street's expectations.\n\nAccording to a consensus of 49 analysts covering Apple, the stock has a 12-month median price target of $250, which would be a 16% increase from current levels. However, an acceleration in Apple's growth thanks to AI could help the stock deliver much stronger gains in 2024 itself and approach the Street-high price target of $300, which will be more than enough to make it the world's first $4 trillion company by the end of the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "What one AI CEO learned by working 20 feet from Apple's Steve Jobs",
        "content": "Learning from tech's grandmaster.\n\nIt’s not often that one can absorb life and business lessons from an all-time great. But Chet Kapoor, chairman and CEO of AI company DataStax, has the distinct pleasure of being in a rarified group.\n\nDuring his time at the computer company NeXT from 1989 to 1993, which Steve Jobs founded in 1985 and sold to Apple (AAPL) in 1997, Kapoor was the self-professed “person that got coffee for the person that made coffee.\"\n\nKapoor said he learned lessons that stayed with him well into his leadership career.\n\n”There were so many things that I saw [from Steve] that I’ve incorporated into what I do, what I’ve done over the last 30 years,” he told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen in here).\n\nThe former IBM (IBM) and Google (GOOG) exec says in business, inspiration is rarely a problem, but actually reaching innovation is hard. Pushing people to innovate and sweat the details is what Jobs did best.\n\n“Innovation doesn’t happen by saying please go out and do this, you have to push people and get them to a place where they will deliver on something they didn’t think they could deliver on,\" Kapoor said.\n\nBefore Jobs died in 2011 from complications tied to pancreatic cancer, he was considered an inspiration and mentor to many in the business and tech fields. Despite his illness, he continued to innovate on products such as the iPad and iPhone.\n\nThat drive at any cost highlights one of the many lessons Kapoor picked up from working near Jobs in the office.\n\n“He always got up in the morning thinking about what people needed, not what people wanted,\" Kapoor added.\n\nNoting that consumers would be stuck with BlackBerry (BB) technology or Nokia (NOK) phones without Jobs, Kapoor stressed Jobs's “relentless obsession for what people needed\" is something that still influences Kapoor's own work.\n\nKapoor also praised Jobs for his dedication to changing the world.\n\n“I believe it’s about making a dent on the universe,” he said. “I learned from Steve [to ask], ‘Are you changing the world? Are you really thinking about it from the user’s perspective, from a societal perspective, and going off and making that happen?” he asked.\n\nThe ability to put those questions to work is part of what inspires Kapoor.\n\n“I love building product businesses that developers love, the products that developers love, and change the trajectory of the enterprises that they work for,” he said.\n\nAnother valuable lesson that comes courtesy of Jobs is making “sure you are very clear on what you’re doing this for,” said Kapoor. “A lot of people in Silicon Valley get stuck where they actually build really cool tech. But the problem is it’s technology. It’s a solution looking for a problem.”\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, Apple is the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $3.43 trillion according to Yahoo Finance data. The company is entering the AI age while raking in billions of dollars each day on the back of Jobs's creations.\n\nAs for the privately held DataStax, it has raised a solid $305 million in capital to support its growth plans. The company's last reported valuation stood at $1.6 billion following a $115 million capital raise in 2022.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Dell new Top Pick at JPMorgan; QCOM, SNOW downgraded",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nAI-driven iPhone 16 could kick off a supercycle for Apple: Wedbush\n\nThe AI-driven launch of the iPhone 16 in September could trigger a significant growth phase for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year, according to Wedbush analysts.\n\nIn a recent note, the investment firm projected that initial iPhone 16 shipments could surpass 90 million units, topping the original market expectations of 80 to 84 million units, and marking a double-digit increase year-over-year.\n\n\"We are seeing more indications across the Asia supply chain this iPhone upgrade cycle could be a historical one setting the stage for a supercycle as currently we estimate roughly 300 million iPhones globally have not upgraded in over 4 years,” the analysts noted.\n\n\"In our view, Apple could sell north of 240 million iPhone units in FY25 as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold.\"\n\nThe analysts also stressed that China remains a crucial region for Apple's growth, with the iPhone 16 projected to generate renewed momentum in this vital market as the company moves into fiscal year 2025.\n\nSince the WWDC event in early June, optimism has been growing within the Asia supply chain, with many anticipating that the iPhone 16 could herald a \"golden upgrade cycle\" for Apple, driven by pent-up global demand.\n\nWith the Apple Intelligence launch, the market is starting to recognize Apple’s potential to become the “gatekeepers of the consumer AI Revolution,” Wedbush stated.\n\nDell stock moved to Top Pick at JPMorgan\n\nJPMorgan analysts named Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) as their new Top Pick earlier this week, citing the company’s strong potential for long-term growth, particularly in the AI server market and traditional infrastructure sectors.\n\nIn a note to investors, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Dell, setting a new price target of $160 by December 2025.\n\nThe analysts noted that Dell's shares have lagged behind other AI-related stocks and the broader market, partly due to concerns about potential margin pressures in the AI server space. However, JPMorgan believes these concerns are exaggerated.\n\n\"The AI Server revenue opportunity remains large,\" the analysts wrote, suggesting that estimates for the AI server total addressable market (TAM) are likely to increase as cloud capital expenditure forecasts are adjusted upward.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey further highlighted that as customer adoption accelerates, revenue growth is expected to drive profit margins higher, particularly with a shift toward smaller cloud and enterprise companies anticipated to lead AI server purchases after 2026.\n\nIn addition to AI servers, JPMorgan sees strong prospects for Dell in traditional infrastructure and enterprise storage markets, with substantial revenue and margin opportunities.\n\nWhile AI PCs have yet to become a significant driver of market expansion, the investment bank believes they could boost near-term revenue through higher volumes and pricing.\n\nWolfe Research cuts Qualcomm rating\n\nWolfe Research downgraded Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares to Peer Perform from Outperform and removed its price target for the stock, citing increasing concerns about the impact of Apple's internal modem on the chipmaker’s future revenue.\n\nThe analysts pointed out that while Qualcomm had previously minimized the potential threat, the landscape has now shifted.\n\n\"It's no surprise that AAPL has been pursuing a modem,\" Wolfe Research remarked, noting that Apple's earlier struggles led many to dismiss the possibility as a \"boy who cried wolf\" scenario.\n\nHowever, Wolfe Research now indicates that recent checks suggest Apple's modem is indeed set to enter the market, which could pose a significant challenge to Qualcomm's business.\n\nQualcomm had earlier guided that it would supply modems for only 20% of the iPhone 18 models, but Wolfe's analysts now forecast a more substantial impact, beginning with the iPhone SE in the spring and expanding with the iPhone 17.\n\nBy the time the iPhone 18 is launched, Apple's modem is expected to be present in all phones outside the U.S.\n\n\"Despite QCOM's prior comments, we don't think this is fully in Street estimates - we're adjusting our numbers accordingly,\" analysts wrote.\n\nThe firm estimates that this development could result in a $4 billion revenue hit and a $1.50 EPS reduction between 2024 and 2026.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm has made efforts to diversify, including a focus on AI handsets and IoT, Wolfe’s team remains cautious, suggesting that these areas will be a \"tougher sell to investors.\"\n\nWells Fargo downgrades Snowflake shares on ‘meaningful’ narrative shift\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stock also faced a downgrade by Wells Fargo analysts on Thursday, sending its shares lower in the market pre-open.\n\nWells Fargo downgraded Snowflake from Overweight to Equal Weight and reduced its price target from $200 to $130.\n\nThe analysts pointed to several growing challenges for the tech company.\n\n\"The narrative has shifted meaningfully,\" the investment bank’s analysts noted, highlighting concerns such as new management, increasing competition, and uncertainties surrounding the company's technological advantage.\n\nA recent data breach has also raised alarms, with the analysts noting that \"multiple breach-impacted customers\" are considering moving away from Snowflake, including some high-value accounts. This could lead to customer churn, further complicating the company’s outlook.\n\nThe downgrade comes ahead of Snowflake's Q2 earnings report, where only modest quarter-over-quarter growth is anticipated. Wells Fargo also raised concerns that new products may not yet contribute significantly to the company’s results, potentially leading to a \"near-term air pocket on top-line growth.\"\n\nWith Snowflake shares still trading at a premium, Wells Fargo sees limited upside potential in the short term, suggesting that the stock is likely to remain \"range-bound until stabilization more clearly surfaces.\"\n\nIn addition, the analysts have lowered their revenue and earnings estimates for FY26 and FY27, adding to the cautious outlook.\n\nSociete Generale identifies the ‘​​most vulnerable’ stock market to an AI trade reversal\n\nIn a recent report, Societe Generale analysts have identified Taiwan's stock market as the most vulnerable to a reversal in the AI trade.\n\nThey point out that Taiwan's equities, particularly in the semiconductor sector - a key component of the AI industry - are highly susceptible due to significant foreign ownership.\n\nForeign investors hold over 40% of Taiwan's equity market and are responsible for 80% of the average trading volume. However, since July, these investors have turned into net sellers, with outflows reaching USD 16 billion, reversing the positive trend seen in the first half of the year.\n\nSociete Generale notes that this capital flight has been exacerbated by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about Taiwan's defense and chip industry, alongside the broader global equity sell-off since July 31.\n\nIn contrast, foreign outflows in South Korea - another major player in the semiconductor market - have been much lower, totaling just $300 million during the same period.\n\nThe concentrated foreign ownership in Taiwan’s semiconductor stocks, which constitute over 40% of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) Index, makes the market particularly sensitive to shifts in the global AI trade momentum, according to the bank’s analysts.\n\nAdding to the concerns, Societe Generale also points out that domestic support has been lacking, with local dealers and proprietary trading desks also being net sellers, further pressuring the country’s stock market.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Dell new Top Pick at JPMorgan; QCOM, SNOW downgraded\n\nSouth Korean AI chip makers Rebellions and Sapeon agree to merge\n\nChina's BYD plans car plant in Karachi as part of Pakistan entry\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Stock I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole, Even After the Market Sell-Off Dropped Its Price",
        "content": "Even though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock dipped during last week's sell-off to nearly 12% off its 2024 high (at Tuesday's close), that wasn't enough to make me want to buy  it.\n\nSo why am I sour on a stock that so many others are bullish on? It all has to do with valuation.\n\nApple's growth has been poor\n\nIf you live in the U.S., chances are you either own an iPhone or other Apple product, or know someone who does. Apple is a little less dominant worldwide, but is still a highly recognizable and popular brand.\n\nBecause Apple's business is mostly centered on high-end electronics, it's more prone to demand cycles than companies selling less expensive electronics. As inflation has taken its toll, Apple's sales have struggled. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nSince the start of 2022, Apple has struggled to post double-digit revenue growth and even had a few quarters where sales dipped compared to the year-ago period. Its latest quarter saw revenue increase year over year, but sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, decreased slightly year over year.\n\nThe last two and a half years would have been much worse for Apple if it weren't for its services division. This encompasses revenue from advertising, the App Store, cloud services, and digital content like Apple TV and Apple Music. Unlike its hardware revenue, which fluctuates, services has more of a subscription-model feel to it, which is great to balance out the more cyclical side of the business.\n\nBut is that enough to justify purchasing the stock?\n\nThe numbers don't add up for the stock\n\nPremium companies trade for premium valuations. Some companies just have such high execution that investors are willing to pay up for them. Apple has been in this position for a while, but I'd like to challenge that notion.\n\nIts revenue growth has been poor, and while its earnings growth has somewhat kept up with the general market, it still struggles to post double-digit increases. AAPL EPS Basic (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nWith Apple approaching three years of uninspiring results, I'm confident it doesn't deserve its premium. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nAt 32 times forward earnings estimates and 33 times trailing earnings, the stock is as expensive as it was in early 2021. At that time, revenue was increasing by 50%, with earnings doubling year over year. Apple was worth the premium investors paid then, but the current Apple is not.\n\nIts investors are holding on to the idea that Apple Intelligence, the company's generative AI product, will be a must-have and cause consumers to upgrade to the latest iPhone. Because this feature can only be run on the latest generation of phones, it could cause an upgrade wave. But that's not guaranteed and wouldn't do much for the stock besides a one-time wave of demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are much better tech investments. Microsoft trades at almost the same valuation yet has consistently posted double-digit revenue and earnings growth.

        "title": "This tantalizing symmetry in Warren Buffett’s stock moves may be a clue on his Apple stake",
        "content": "Just a crazy coincidence, or not?\n\nA striking detail in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio has caught the attention of Wall Street as investors look for clues on what CEO Warren Buffett could do next.\n\n\"Berkshire owned exactly 400,000,000 shares of Apple and 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola as of June 30, 2024,\" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, tweeted on Wednesday. \"If Buffett likes round numbers, he may not be planning to sell additional shares of Apple.\"\n\nIn an email to Fortune, Kass acknowledged that the numbers by may just be a coincidence but said he believes that Buffett is signaling he's done selling and \"plans to hold his Apple shares indefinitely,\" similar to his Coca-Cola stock.\n\n\"Since Buffett has said that the CEO is the chief risk officer, I believe Buffett has been acting in a prudent fashion by reducing Apple's portfolio weight from 50% down to 30%,\" he added, noting that Berkshire's initial Apple investment of about $30 billion had appreciated to around $180 billion.\n\nBuffett followers—and investors overall—have been puzzling over his possible intentions after the conglomerate revealed a nearly 50% cut in its Apple stake earlier this month. While analysts don't think he will completely unload the rest of his Apple shares, the dramatic cut in the second quarter raised questions about further reductions.\n\nOf course, while Berkshire now holds the same number of shares in Apple and Coca-Cola, the value of those stakes are wildly different. As of Friday's closing prices, the Apple stake was worth $90.4 billion, while the Coke stake was worth $27.7 billion.\n\nAccording to Kass, Apple accounted for almost 50% of Berkshire's equity investments at the end of the second quarter, while Coca-Cola represented 9%.\n\nBut because Coca-Cola is Buffett’s oldest and longest stock position, which has remained steady for decades, the symmetry in his Apple shares has been too juicy to ignore, as CNBC and the Wall Street Journal also picked up on Kass's tweet this past week.\n\nIn addition, Buffett is a hard-core fan of Coca-Cola, reportedly drinking five cans of Coke a day, while he is also an iPhone user and has praised Apple for how loyal its customers are.\n\nRepresentatives for Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnalysts viewed the Apple stock sale as a risk-management move, noting that it had grown to take up a massive chunk of the portfolio by valuation. In fact, it followed earlier moves to trim the portfolio. In May, Berkshire disclosed the sale of 100 million Apple shares, amounting to 13% of its stake at the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert told Fortune last week that the latest Apple stock sale represents a \"classic rebalancing of the portfolio.\"\n\nWith Berkshire’s portfolio skewed so heavily toward a handful of stocks like Apple, there was the risk of too much concentration, she explained. Some profit-taking also could have been involved, as the sales occurred when the broader stock market was notching record high after record high.\n\nThe stock dump helped boost Berkshire's cash pile to a fresh high of $277 billion by the end of the second quarter, and Kass pointed out on X that it almost equals its $285 billion investments in equities overall.\n\nBut despite his latest moves, Buffett is still considered more of a buy-and-hold investor and hasn't done that much reshuffling compared to his peers.\n\n\"Over the past decade, Berkshire's average portfolio turnover rate has been quite low, often ranging between 5% to 10% per year,\" Kass tweeted. \"The average turnover rate for large-capitalization managed equity funds over the past 10 years typically ranges from 30% to 60% per year.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 ETF I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole",
        "content": "Since they were introduced to the stock market in the 1990s, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been among the most useful tools for investors. They offer all the broad market exposure of mutual funds, but they come in a more investor-friendly package -- their fees are typically lower, and they can be bought and sold in a brokerage account just like stocks. Investing made simple(r).\n\nThere are countless ETFs on the stock market, covering virtually any sector, industry, interest, or theme you could be interested in. Whether it's technology, cannabis, or space exploration, if you want to find an ETF for it, you likely can. That said, not all ETFs are equally helpful, and some are worth avoiding.\n\nOne ETF in particular I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole right now is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) -- even with its recent success.\n\nToo few companies are leading the charge\n\nThis 320-stock ETF contains large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies in the information technology sector. These companies' specialties include semiconductors (29.9% of the ETF), systems software (22.2%), technology hardware and storage (18.1%), application software (13.4%), communications equipment (3.1%), and a handful more.\n\nSince the ETF is weighted by market cap, larger companies exert more influence than smaller companies. Unfortunately, that's part of the problem. Here are the ETF's top three holdings and how much of the fund they make up:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): 16.66% Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 16.07% Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 14.63%\n\nThree companies that make up less than 1% of the ETF's companies account for more than 47% of its weight. There's a lack of diversification, and then there's this.\n\nWhen it's great, it's great; when it's not, it's bad\n\nIt's only fair to acknowledge that the ETF has been wildly successful over the past decade, far outperforming the U.S. stock market's three major indexes. In fact, none of the indexes have come even remotely close to the ETF's returns over that span. VGT Chart\n\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia are three of the best companies in the world. Microsoft has been at the top of the tech food chain for almost 50 years, Apple is arguably the gold standard for consumer electronics, and Nvidia is one of the companies at the forefront of AI technology.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes, \"The same thing that makes you laugh can make you cry.\" The success of the above three companies has pushed the index forward over the past decade, but any down period for the three could drag down the ETF's performance. As an example, let's look at the past month when the three companies experienced a pullback.\n\nStory continues VGT Chart\n\nOf course, Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia aren't solely responsible for the ETF's decline over that span. But considering how much of it they account for and their declines, they bear a decent amount of the responsibility. As they go, so goes the ETF.\n\nDo I expect these three companies to have bad years? Not at all. Are they priced at a premium and susceptible to a correction if market conditions change? For sure.\n\nThere may be a better route for investors\n\nInstead of investing in this ETF and putting its success (or lack thereof) in the hands of a few companies, you should consider a similar but more diversified ETF like the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF(NASDAQ: QQQ). It mirrors the Nasdaq-100, an index that contains the largest 100 nonfinancial companies trading on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nIt's not a pure tech ETF like the Vanguard ETF, but 50% of the ETF is made up of information technology companies, and its top three holdings are the same:\n\nApple: 9.14% Microsoft: 8.32% Nvidia: 7.10%\n\nThis gives you a chance to get the benefits of investing in some of the world's best tech companies without relying too much on their success to boost the ETF's performance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A massive iPhone upgrade cycle is just around the corner for Apple. The tech giant is slated to release the newest version next month; the AI-driven launch of the iPhone 16 is expected to usher in a considerable growth phase over the next year.\n\nWith more than two billion active devices globally along with the implementation of Apple Intelligence, new and exciting monetization opportunities are on the way. In a partnership with OpenAI, Apple’s newest iPhones will seamlessly integrate ChatGPT, helping users write with enhanced language capabilities, create stunning images, and communicate with a more capable Siri.\n\nThe Zacks Rundown\n\nApple AAPL shares broke out of a wide, multi-month base earlier this year. The stock, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has begun to display signs of outperformance.\n\nThe company is part of the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry group, which ranks in the top 41% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the past 3 months: Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis industry is also showing favorable characteristics as we can see below: Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHistorical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nApple shares are trading just a few percent below their all-time high ahead of the September iPhone release event. While there are many ways to take advantage of a potentially bullish move, options provide us with flexibility, enabling us to tailor our strategy to the current market environment.\n\nOption Essentials\n\nBefore we analyze today’s trade, let’s review some option fundamentals as a refresher. There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I’ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it is to work over the long run.\n\nOptions are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right – but not the obligation – to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price, which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a particular security, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option, whether a put or call, is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese contracts are valid for a specific period of time which ends on expiration day. There are weekly options, monthly options, and even LEAPS options which are longer-term options that have an expiration date of greater than one year.\n\nOptions consist of time value and intrinsic value. In-the-money options consist of both components; at-the-money and out-of-the-money options consist only of time value. At options expiration, options lose all time value.\n\nBelow we’re going to explore a call option purchase strategy.\n\nMultiply Your Apple Returns\n\nApple stock is in a price uptrend and is a good candidate for a call option purchase: StockCharts\n\nImage Source: StockCharts\n\nWhen done correctly, trading options provides huge profit opportunities with limited risk.\n\nIn today’s trade, we’re going to target the September 20th expiration date and the 180-strike price. Purchasing this option gives us the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of AAPL stock at $180 on or before September 20th, which is a bit over 1 month from now.\n\nThe table below displays the risk/reward profile for this trade. Apple stock is currently trading at $224.10 (orange box). We are purchasing 1 September 20 180-strike call at 45.3 points, which is the option premium. Since options account for 100 shares of the underlying stock, the total cost for this call option trade is $4,530 as we can see in the yellow highlighted box. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe top (blue) row shows the performance of Apple stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration. The bottom (purple) row shows the corresponding percentage return for our call option trade. We can see that if Apple remains flat, this trade would encounter a minor loss of 2.6%. If Apple moves up 5%, this trade will realize a 22.1% profit. If AAPL advances 15%, we would realize a 71.6% profit.\n\nThis illustration shows the inherent leverage that options provide. A stock investor who bought 100 shares of AAPL would have to contribute $22,410, which is a much bigger investment. A 15% increase in the stock price would yield a $3,361 profit.\n\nOn the other hand, in this example the option trader only needs to contribute $4,530 to control the same amount of underlying AAPL shares. A 15% move in AAPL stock would net a $3,242 option profit – a nearly identical profit amount with only about one-fifth of the investment!\n\nAlso note that this option contains relatively little time value. The 1.2 points worth of time value (red box) equate to just 0.5% of the underlying stock price. A good way to manage risk when buying call options is to minimize time value and maximize intrinsic value, as time value decays rapidly in the days leading up to option expiration.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWith Apple Intelligence powering the next generation of iPhones, the stage is now set for Apple to experience an outsized bullish run. Apple could very well be in store for a period of outperformance.\n\nA great way to take advantage of this move is via low-risk call options. This allows us to leverage Apple stock returns with the power of options. Be sure to keep track of how AAPL stock performs heading into the upcoming iPhone announcement.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "TJX Companies' Upside Is Limited Due to High Valuation",
        "content": "TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX) has historically delivered solid returns for shareholders. The stock has delivered a total return of roughly 68% over the past three years, while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 26% over the same period. The move higher has been driven by strong earnings growth and investor enthusiasm for the company's international expansion plans.\n\nCurrently, the stock trades at roughly 27 times forward earnings per share, which represents a significant premium to the broader market, a premium to other discount retailers and a valuation which is in line with some of the highest-quality businesses in the world. While it may be able to maintain current levels, I view significant upside as limited due to the stock's high valuation.\n\nCompany overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with TJX. List of 52-Week Lows List of 3-Year Lows List of 5-Year Lows\n\nTJX Companies is a leading discount retailer with over 4,900 locations across nine countries. The company operates stores under a number of different brand, names including TJ Maxx, Marshalls, Sierra, HomeGoods, Winners and others. While the company generates most of its sales in the U.S., international markets include Canada, Australia, Germany, the U.K., Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nThe company generally offers a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise at prices 20% to 60% below full-price retailers. The company is able to achieve these prices by deploying an opportunistic buying merchandising strategy that allows it to acquire goods at lower prices than other retailers. TJX Companies embraces the fact its merchandise tends to change frequently and offers consumers a treasure hunt-type shopping experience. Despite operating in a highly competitive industry, the company has been able to generate solid results and has generated a return on capital well above its cost of capital. TJX Companies' Upside Is Limited Due to High Valuation\n\nRetail is a tough business, but TJX is well positioned\n\nWhile TJX Companies has been able to deliver strong results historically, the fact remains the company operates in a very difficult industry. The retail business is highly competitive and the company faces competition from other physical and online retailers. Key competitors include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), JC Penney (JCPNQ), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and many others. In addition to being highly competitive, the retail business is fairly capital intensive due to the need for retailers to hold inventory. Finally, the retail business is also challenging because consumer tastes and preferences rapidly evolve.\n\nInvesting guru Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) summed up the challenges that retailers face in his 1995 shareholder letter:\n\n\"Retailing is a tough business. During my investment career, I have watched a large number of retailers enjoy terrific growth and superb returns on equity for a period, and then suddenly nosedive, often all the way into bankruptcy. This shooting-star phenomenon is far more common in retailing than it is in manufacturing or service businesses. In part, this is because a retailer must stay smart, day after day. Your competitor is always copying and then topping whatever you do. Shoppers are meanwhile beckoned in every conceivable way to try a stream of new merchants. In retailing, to coast is to fail.\"\n\nAs a result of these factors, a number of leading U.S.-based retailers have gone out of business despite having a very strong market position for long periods of time. Notable retail failures include Sears, Lord & Taylor, Bed Bath & Beyond, Toys R Us, Circuit City and many others.\n\nTJX Companies is well positioned in that, thus far, it has been mostly immune to the threat posed by Amazon and other online retailers. Consumers continue to value the treasure hunt shopping experience and TJX's prices tend to be very competitive with Amazon. On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Ernie Herman responded to a question regarding new competition from Temu and Shien:\n\n\"On the question about some of those online players you were talking about, we feel just as similar -- they're so commodity-driven and so not the brands that we would carry very much not the good, better, best type of branded mix that we would go after. We see very little issue with them taking market share from us. I could see that their business model could overlap with some other brick-and-mortar guys or some other online guys for sure. But we just don't see that as bumping up with our customer base or end use.\"\n\nValuation comparisons\n\nCurrently, TJX Companies trades at roughly 27 times forward earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at around 22 times forward earnings per share. Thus, the company is currently trading at a significant premium to the broader market. Moreover, it is trading at a valuation which is fairly close to some of the highest-quality stocks in the market, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which trade at 29 and 31 times forward earnings.\n\nWhile Apple and Microsoft represent vastly different businesses than TJX Companies, they represent a valuable yardstick as to what a reasonable valuation is for a very high-quality business. Given the fact the company competes in a highly competitive business, I believe there is a solid case to be made that it should trade at a significant discount to these stalwarts.\n\nConsensus estimates currently call for TJX Companies to report earnings per share growth rates of 7% for fiscal year 2025, 10% for 2026 and 13% for 2027. Comparably, the S&P 500 is expected to deliver earnings growth of roughly 11% for 2024 and 14% for 2025. Thus, on a relative basis, TJX Companies' valuation premium does not appear to be warranted versus the broader market based on earnings growth prospects.\n\nIn addition to trading at a premium to the broader market, TJX Companies is also trading at a premium relative to its peers. Ross Stores, which is arguably its closest competitor, trades at 23 times forward earnings per share and has near-term growth prospects that are similar to TJX. Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL), another comparable discount retailer, trades around 32 times forward earnings, but is expected to experience faster near-term earnings growth. Consensus estimates call for Burlington Stores to report annual earnings per share growth of roughly 27%, 23% and 23% over the next three years. Walmart, which is somewhat different due to its larger scale, focus on grocery and strong online retail presence, trades at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nAnother reasonable comparison is dollar stores given their focus on discount retail. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) trade at 16.50 and 14.30 times forward earnings. While Dollar General has near-term growth prospects which are similar to TJX Companies, Dollar Tree has arguably better growth prospects and is expected to grow earnings per share by 12.70%, 18.50% and 13.90% over the next three years.\n\nTJX Companies is also trading at a premium to its own historical median valuation based on key metrics such as forward price-earnings ratio. Historically, the stock has traded at a median price-earnings ratio of 22. Taken together, I view the stock's valuation re-rating potential as more skewed toward the downside as a reasonable case can be made that the stock should trade closer to 23 times forward earnings, which would put it more in line with its closest peer. Using dollar store stock valuations as a guidepost would suggest TJX Companies could trade at a mid-teens multiple. On the other hand, I do not see much of a case for the stock to trade at even a modestly higher valuation than is currently the case as that would put the stock's valuation at a premium to Walmart and in-line with technology stalwarts Apple and Microsoft.\n\nHow TJX could grow into its current valuation\n\nWhile TJX Companies is currently trading at a high valuation, the stock could return to more reasonable levels if it is able to deliver better-than-expected earnings growth over the next few years. The company has ambitious plans and believes it can grow its total store count to more than 6,200 locations over the long term. Moreover, the company has potential to gain market share from other brick-and-mortar retailers which are closing stores. Macy's (NYSE:M) has announced plans to close 150 stores over the next few years and it would not be surprising to see other department stores follow suit.\n\nExpansion into new international markets also has potential to be a major growth driver. In early June, TJX Companies announced plans to form a joint venture with Grupo Axo. As part of the proposed transaction, which is expected to close later this year, TJX Companies would become a 49% owner of Axo's existing off-price business in Mexico, which includes more than 200 stores.\n\nAdditional merger and acquisition opportunities could provide another lever for the company to deliver better-than-expected earnings growth. TJX Companies is not a stranger to large-scale deals and acquired one of its largest brands, Marshalls, in 1995. At the time, Marshalls was the second-largest off-price retailer in the U.S. TJX Companies also acquired Winners in 1990.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting M&A opportunity for TJX Companies currently would be to acquire its leading competitor, Ross, which has a market capitalization of $47 billion compared to its market cap of $130 billion. The Ross Stores brand could complement TJX Companies' existing brands well as it tends to focus on the low end of the off-price retail business, while TJX Companies tends to focus more on the middle market. Moreover, a merger with Ross Stores could give TJX better bargaining power with suppliers and create back-end cost synergies that could help improve margins, resulting in better-than-expected earnings growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nTJX Companies has a solid history of delivering strong results for shareholders despite operating in a very challenging industry. The company has provided customers with a unique value proposition, which includes a treasure hunt shopping experience. Unlike many other traditional retailers, TJX has continued to grow despite the secular shift toward online operations.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a significant premium to the broader market and has lower near-term growth prospects. Additionally, the stock trades at a significant premium to its closest competitor. While the company may be able to grow into its current valuation by delivering better-than-expected earnings growth, I believe upside for the stock from current levels is limited due to its high valuation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Apple Inc. (AAPL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.52 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $93.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.21 billion and $421.35 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Multiplayer shooter game Fortnite is available again on iPhones in the European Union and worldwide on Google's Android devices after a gap of four years, following legal measures by the EU, developer Epic Games said on Friday.\n\nFortnite, created by Epic, a U.S.-based studio, and backed by China's Tencent, the world's largest game studio, launched in 2017 and its last-player-standing, \"battle royale\" format became an instant hit, drawing in millions of dedicated players.\n\nBut in August 2020, Apple and Alphabet's Google removed Fortnite from their app stores for violating their guidelines by launching a payment feature, prompting several lawsuits challenging their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on payments.\n\nAt the time of the ban, Epic had 116 million users just on Apple's platform.\n\nThe EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) law is allowing Epic to launch its game store in the bloc, though Apple is still blocking users outside Europe from accessing Fortnite and its games store, the company said.\n\n\"We are really grateful to the European Commission for not only passing the DMA and enabling store competition, but also going in and robustly holding Apple and Google's feet to the fire to ensure that they can't just obstruct competition,\" Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"They were going to great efforts to slow us down, and tried to stop us several times, and the European Commission always stepped up and ensured that competitors were able to enter the market,\" he said.\n\nThe store is launching with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and the all-new Fall Guys for mobile, and Epic is working with other developers to launch their games and apps through its store.\n\nEpic, which has 75 million monthly active users in its PC store, expects to add 100 million new mobile users by the end of the year.\n\nThe games would also be available through independent mobile stores such as AltStore.\n\nHowever, the installation process is lengthy with a 15-step installation process on iOS devices, confusing device settings and scare screens, Epic said.\n\nApple said that to enable the new capabilities for developers in the EU, it worked to make them as easy as possible for users while also trying to protect their privacy and security.\n\n\"We probably lost over a billion dollars of revenue by losing access to the iOS customer base worldwide for four years, but what's the cost of freedom?,\" Sweeney said.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by David Holmes)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wells Fargo Investment Institute published on Tuesday the list of “stocks for all seasons,” with tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sitting right on top of the roster.\n\nDue to being considered reliable investments in both volatile and stable markets, Microsoft and Apple found their way to Wells Fargo’s multiple recommended list, including the Core, Diversified Stock Income Plan (DSIP), and Focus Lists.\n\nThe Core List is comprised of blue-chip, industry-leading companies that provide a foundation for a well-diversified portfolio. The DSIP List focuses on companies with reliable dividend growth, while the Focus List targets stocks expected to outperform the S&P 500 index over a 12-18 month horizon.\n\nAccording to Wells Fargo, the Focus List serves as the reference point as it operates with this tactical time horizon of 12-18 months, while the Core and DSIP Lists operate on longer-term time horizons of five or more years.\r\n\r\n“We believe companies that fit both time horizons can be viewed as solid investment options during periods of shorter-term volatility,” the bank's strategists said in the note.\n\nIn addition to Apple and Microsoft, other companies that are included in at least two of the three lists are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Linde (NYSE:LIN), Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR)., Visa Inc (NYSE:V)., Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), among others.\n\nCintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS)., Ecolab (NYSE:ECL), Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH), S&P Global, and Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) were also highlighted.\n\nWells Fargo Investment Institute publishes nine equity recommendation lists in total, each tailored with different time horizons, benchmarks, objectives, and criteria.

        "title": "GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is the Best Buy?",
        "content": "This summer, the previously unassailable Magnificent Seven stocks have experienced some uncharacteristic weakness. Investors have been taking stock of both their large gains over the past year and their relatively elevated valuations and evaluating whether there are more attractive opportunities in other sectors of the market. This has led to something of a rotation into more value-oriented sectors like Healthcare and Financials.\n\nBut these are still some of the world’s most dominant companies, and the upside of this summer swoon is that it has created the opportunity to buy some of their shares at more attractive entry points. So let’s take a look at three of the top Magnificent Seven stocks — GOOGL, AAPL, and MSFT — and determine which looks like the most attractive investment opportunity for investors right now.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL)\n\nAmid this summer’s tech sell-off, Alphabet, the parent company of Google, YouTube, and more, is in correction territory, down 16.6% from its 52-week high. But there’s a lot to like about Alphabet stock, and I am bullish on it.\n\nMagnificent Seven stocks aren’t typically associated with value investing, but there’s a reason that Alphabet keeps showing up in the portfolios of some of the market’s top value investors, like Li Lu of Himalaya Capital, Oakmark’s Bill Nygren, and Oakcliff’s Bryan Lawrence. In fact, between its two share classes, Google makes up nearly 40% of Himalaya’s portfolio, representing a massive bet for Lu.\n\nThese value superstars recognize that Alphabet is surprisingly cheap. The stock trades at 21.1 times 2024 consensus earnings estimates but looks even cheaper heading into 2025, where it trades at just 18.5 times forward estimates.\n\nThis means that Alphabet is trading at a discount to the broader market, with the S&P 500 (SPX) trading at 23.2 times earnings and 21.9 times forward earnings. This presents an attractive opportunity for a world-class company with a dominant position in search and other strong businesses like YouTube, especially given its impressive earnings growth of 21.6% per year over the past five years.\n\nYes, Alphabet faces challenges from regulators — a federal judge recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws, and the Department of Justice may push for a breakup. But this isn’t necessarily the likeliest outcome, and Google can appeal.\n\nAnd even if it does happen, it could actually be a boon for Alphabet shareholders, as owning standalone businesses could unlock additional value. Imagine receiving a spinoff of YouTube shares? Many analysts believe YouTube would be an extremely lucrative standalone company in its own right and that some of its value is obscured by being part of the larger conglomerate.\n\nStory continues\n\nI’m bullish on Alphabet, as it is trading in value stock territory after this summer’s correction, and its cheap valuation seems like a great bargain for a dominant business with a track record of strong earnings growth. Plus, any potential jostling with regulators could have the silver lining of unlocking new value for shareholders. Additionally, analysts believe this Strong Buy stock harbors significant upside potential, as we’ll discuss below.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for Alphabet Stock?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, GOOGL earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average GOOGL stock price target of $205.18 implies 27.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple, the world’s largest company by market cap, has held up better than Alphabet and many of its tech-sector peers during this summer’s rotation. It’s down just 5.2% from its highs. While this is great for long-term Apple holders, it also means there is less of an opportunity for new investors to buy ahead of a rebound. Apple stock is also quite a bit more expensive than Alphabet (not to mention the broader market), making me neutral on the stock. Shares trade at 33.1 times 2024 earnings and 29.9 times consensus 2025 earnings estimates.\n\nThe stock’s earnings growth has also been slower than Google’s. While Google has grown earnings 21.6% per year over the past five years, Apple has grown them at a solid but slower 15.6%. Apple’s growth over the next five years is also projected to be slower than Alphabet’s, with 11.1% growth projected versus 20.5% for Alphabet. Obviously, five years is a long way out, so these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, but this is a large gap.\n\nLastly, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B), the company’s top shareholder with a massive stake, recently shocked the market when it sold nearly half of its position. Apple is still Berkshire’s largest holding, but perhaps Buffett sees Apple as having less upside than it did in the past.\n\nApple is an all-time great company and stock, but right now, it appears to have less upside than Google for these reasons.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for AAPL Stock?\n\nAAPL earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average AAPL stock price target of $248.78 implies 10.7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more AAPL analyst ratings\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nAn analysis of Magnificent Seven stocks without Microsoft just wouldn’t feel complete. Shares of the mega-cap stock have fallen 10.3% from their high — less than Alphabet but more than Apple.\n\nIn terms of its valuation, Microsoft is also much more expensive than Alphabet and roughly in line with Apple, trading at 31.6 times consensus Fiscal 2025 earnings estimates (Microsoft just reported fourth-quarter earnings and is already into Fiscal 2025).\n\nMicrosoft’s earnings growth has also fallen between that of Alphabet and Apple — the company has grown earnings per share at an 18.5% rate over the past five years and is projected to grow EPS at 14.6% per year over the next five.\n\nThis is better than Apple’s earnings growth but trails Alphabet’s, and with the large gap in valuation between the two stocks, Alphabet clearly looks like the more compelling buy. Overall, I am neutral on MSFT stock due to its relatively elevated valuation.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for MSFT Stock?\n\nMSFT earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 32 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average MSFT stock price target of $503.19 implies 19.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nSee more MSFT analyst ratings\n\nThe Winner Is…\n\nOf these three Magnificent Seven giants, Alphabet looks like the most attractive buying opportunity right now by some margin. Not only is the stock significantly cheaper than that of Apple or Microsoft, but it has been posting better earnings growth over the past five years and is projected to continue doing so. Alphabet has also sold off more than its peers, creating more of an opportunity to buy before a rebound.\n\nBelow, you can check out a comparison of Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool, which allows investors to compare up to 10 stocks at a time on a variety of factors, ranging from valuation to recent performance. As you can see from the table, Alphabet is by far the cheapest stock in terms of valuation, and analysts see it as having the most upside.\n\nOne of the primary headwinds standing in Alphabet’s way is the DOJ lawsuit, but even if it does culminate in the company splitting up, businesses like YouTube would be incredibly attractive standalone businesses, and a split up could unlock significant value for shareholders.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) Is A Solid Investment Despite Ongoing Concerns About Taiwan",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\n\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\n\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\n\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\n\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won’t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\n\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\n\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\n\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\n\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\" Is TSM Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nA close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:135\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), the world's leading semiconductor foundry, dominates the global market with over 50% share, making it a crucial supplier to major tech companies like\n\nApple Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AAPL),\n\nNVIDIA Corporation\n\n(NASDAQ:NVDA), and\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\n\n(NASDAQ:AMD). Its cutting-edge technology, including 5nm and 3nm chips, keeps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) ahead of competitors and ensures consistent demand for its products.\n\nTo manage geopolitical risks and meet increasing global demand, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its manufacturing operations beyond Taiwan, with significant investments in the U.S. and Japan. This strategic move is reflected in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)'s strong financial performance, with recent revenue reaching $20.82 billion and earnings per share at $1.48, both surpassing expectations.\n\nWhen asked if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is a good long-term buy, Jim Cramer responded positively, saying it’s a solid investment despite ongoing concerns about Taiwan.\n\n\"I think you're fine. I think that there's always going to be a worry about Taiwan. I think that if you go back to what Lisa Su said, she didn't tell you not to worry about it because nobody says that. She says, you know, this one is not going to be a problem, and I'm with her\". Cramer said.\n\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Unsurprisingly the portfolio’s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) and Alphabet. While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\n\nWhile this positioning is painful in the short-term, we see considerable embedded value in our portfolio. We also see considerable risks and uncertainties existing in the AI theme that are not reflected in the Value Latency on offer in many stocks that have surged.\n\nReturning to the AI story, today the portfolio has around 10% of capital invested across TSMC and Alphabet. We think TSMC has a tremendous opportunity to extract more value from the profit pool currently being enjoyed by its downstream customers.”\n\nOverall TSM ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Billionaire Paul Singer Says He’s Staying Away from Apple (AAPL) and Other AI Bubble Stocks",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management has reportedly said in a latest letter to investors that mega-cap AI tech stocks are in “bubble land” and Nvidia is “overhyped.” The fund said in its letter that it’s skeptical about the notion that technology companies will keep buying AI chips in high volumes in the future, adding that AI is “overhyped with many applications not ready for prime time”. It also claimed that many AI use cases are “never going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver “value commensurate with the hype”.\n\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are “few real uses” of AI other than “summarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”.\n\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from “bubble” stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\n\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\n\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it’s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\n\nHere is what Insider Monkey’s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management’s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\n“I have been saying that NVDA’s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don’t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That’s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn’t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That’s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.”\n\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer’s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Billionaire Paul Singer Say Stay Away from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Bubble Stock?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple is an important part of the Mag. 7 group which Elliott Management is bearish on.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI initiative Apple Intelligence has started to make sense to Wall Street analysts. Recently, Baird raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $200, citing a potential upgrade cycle in iPhone because of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\n\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He’s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nWarren Buffett, the legendary investor, has disclosed significant stock sales by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) in the second quarter, including a substantial reduction in its Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings.\n\nWhat Happened: Buffett's company sold over 389 million Apple shares in the second quarter, according to the company's latest U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. Despite the sale, Berkshire Hathaway still holds 400 million Apple shares.\n\nThe news that Buffett had sold a significant portion of Apple shares was revealed in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the precise number of shares sold only became clear on Wednesday.\n\nTrending:\n\nDon’t miss out on the next NVIDIA – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10. **This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus.

Invest now and earn returns.\n\nBesides Apple, Berkshire Hathaway also trimmed its investments in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF), Floor & Decor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX)\n\nThe company has boosted its holdings in Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) to 27,033,784 shares and Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)to 255,281,524 shares. Additionally, it has made new, smaller investments in aerospace parts manufacturer Heico Corp (NYSE:HEI) with 1,044,242 shares and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) with 690,106 shares.\n\nTesla Inc.‘s CEO Elon Musk commented on Berkshire Hathaway's substantial $277 billion cash reserves, predicting changes as T-bill returns decline following the revelation of the conglomerate's stake sales. Musk said, \"$277B cash reserves is wild. That will change as the T-bill return drops.\"\n\nDon't Miss Out:\n\nPrivate markets have historically outperformed stocks in every downturn of the past 15 years — build your diversified portfolio.

Discover the potential of this market before other investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy It Matters: Buffett's investment decisions have always been closely watched due to his remarkable track record. This recent move comes at a time when Berkshire Hathaway's stock is up over 20% year-to-date, despite trailing the broader stock markets for much of the year due to its large holding in Apple.\n\nEarlier in August, Buffett's decision to sell nearly half of Berkshire's Apple stock was seen by Elon Musk as an indication of an impending market correction.\n\nGlobal market volatility has also tested Buffett's investments. Despite a significant initial plunge, Berkshire's $20 billion investment in Japanese trading giants recovered most of its losses. The global market turmoil triggered by Japan's rate hike had a limited impact on these investments.\n\nBuffett's recent stock sales have also contributed to Berkshire's cash reserves swelling to a record $277 billion. This increase in cash reserves comes despite a 15.5% year-over-year fall in the company's second-quarter net earnings, largely due to a decline in investment gains amid volatile market conditions.\n\nPrice Action: Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Class A stock closed at $657,122.00 on Wednesday, marking a gain of 1.24%. Year-to-date, it has risen by 19.52%. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Class B stock finished at $438.47 on the same day, up by 1.40%. In after-hours trading, it increased 0.14%. Year-to-date, the stock has appreciated 20.97%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

If the users do not respond, the feature notifies the emergency contacts and the appropriate authorities.\r\n\r\nThe feature can be useful in saving someone’s life from cardiac arrest, circulatory failure, overdose or poisoning.\r\n\r\nGoogle also integrated Fitbit’s exercise-tracking software into the Pixel Watch 3.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are some new features, which help plan routines and set different splits while running. The new Pixel watch also provides a morning brief about the overall health metrics.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global smartwatch market is expected to hit $33.58 billion in 2024 and $103.61 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 15.1% between 2024 and 2032.  \r\n\r\nAlphabet’s solid efforts to strengthen its Pixel Watch series are expected to continue helping it bolster its presence in the booming smartwatch market.\r\n\r\nApart from the Pixel Watch 3 launch, the first-generation Pixel Watch now features a new Fitbit Workout UI, replacing the cramped layout of the previous version. The updated layout places key stats in a list that can be swiped up/down, making it more glanceable during exercise.\r\n\r\nGoogle upgraded the Pixel Camera app on Wear OS, which now allows users to switch between various photo and video modes on their Pixel Watch, including Night Sight, Portrait, Photo, Video, Slow Motion and Time Lapse, directly from the Pixel Watch's hamburger button.\r\n\r\nThe company is also making strides to bolster its Wear OS in order to deliver enhanced user experience and gain further customer momentum. Google enjoys great customer momentum with Wear OS, which powers two premium smartwatch brands, including Samsung and Fossil FOSL, other than the Pixel watches.\r\n\r\nStrengthening Pixel Watch offerings are likely to aid Alphabet in bolstering its Google Services segment, which is a key growth driver for the company. In second-quarter 2024, the segment generated $73.93 billion in revenues (87.2% of total revenues), up 11.5% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nAlphabet’s growing efforts to bolster the Pixel Watch series are likely to intensify competition for other incumbents like Apple AAPL and Garmin GRMN, which are leaving no stone unturned to expand their footprints in the smartwatch market.\r\n\r\nGoogle strives to narrow down its gap from Apple in the smartwatch battle with the launch of Pixel Watch 3, which is ahead of the launch of the latter’s next-generation watch.\r\n\r\nApple is gearing up to launch the Apple Watch Series 10, which is currently dominating the smartwatch market on the back of its expanding Watch family. It is constantly making efforts to sustain its supremacy as well. The strong adoption of the Apple Watch on the back of useful and advanced features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app and Activity Trends remains a major positive. \r\n\r\nGarmin is enjoying growing momentum across its adventure watches on the back of feature updates.\r\n\r\nGarmin recently released new software and feature updates for select smartwatches, including epix (Gen 2), fenix 7, Forerunner, vívoactive 5 and Venu 3 Series. The new software includes features like Multisport Auto Transition, Running Track Database, Sleep Coach and Jump Rope Activity. It allows users to focus on races, track runs, sleep stages, and other key metrics and offers customizable alert intervals and countdown timers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller’s investment firms trimmed their holdings in “Magnificent Seven” stocks before this year’s ebullient run-up in technology companies gave way to a major downturn in mid-July.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction The Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\n\nSoros Fund Management sold some of its stake in Alphabet Inc. totaling $58 million, and about $15 million of Amazon.com Inc., according to regulatory filings for the three months ended in June.\n\nDruckenmiller was among investors paring stakes in Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose soaring price accompanied investor fervor for artificial intelligence companies. His Duquesne Family Office sold more than 1.5 million shares, filings show.\n\nDavid Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, meanwhile, cut its holdings of Amazon, Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — three of its largest positions — continuing similar cuts reported at the end of March. David Bonderman’s Wildcat Capital Management also sold out of his Meta position, dumping shares worth $24 million in the quarter.\n\nThe filings point to how investors captured some of the benefits of the run-up before a benign economic outlook took a gloomier turn, with the Nasdaq 100 slumping 14% in the four-week period beginning July 10. The “Magnificent Seven” — which includes Alphabet, Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia — had been emblematic of the rally, reflected in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index, which rose 17% in both the first and second quarters.\n\nSpeaking in a CNBC interview in May, Druckenmiller — who earlier spent more than a decade as Soros’ chief strategist — suggested the artificial intelligence boom may be “over-hyped” in the short term.\n\nFunds with more than $100 million or more must file disclosures about their US holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The disclosures portray holdings of secretive money managers, including at hedge funds and large family offices that clear the threshold. Still, the picture is incomplete as documents omit most derivatives and short positions.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nIconiq Capital, the investment firm best known for managing money for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, sold $2.5 million in Apple. Kemnay Advisory Services, a family office that helps manage the fortune of duty-free-shopping billionaire Alan Parker, cut its holdings of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon. Soros sold out of its $108 million position in American National Insurance, and $67 million in Aramark. Druckenmiller’s Duquesne reported a new position in Mid-America Apartment Communities, a real estate investment trust that acquires multi-family apartments, worth $92 million and in cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc. of $90 million.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\n\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\n\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\n\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\n\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\n\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\n\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 150\n\nYTD Return as of August 1: 25%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company is working to include AI products into the consumer electronics it markets, most notably the iPhone, expected to be released later this year. Some reports indicate that the firm will debut Apple Intelligence in the new phone. At a tech event earlier this year, the firm revealed some of the capabilities of the new AI offering, which included massive changes to popular iPhone applications like Siri, Genmoji, and Image Playground. There are rumors that the firm may put advanced features of the AI software behind some kind of a paywall.\n\nTim Cook, the CEO of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), praised the performance of in-house chips during the second quarter earnings call, noting that Mac computers were powered by Apple silicon with a powerful neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level. He said these computers would be able to take advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia, two new AI products of the firm.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 30th on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "AI Bubble or Deep Value? 3 Semi Stocks to Watch After Last Week’s Plunge",
        "content": "Is there an artificial intelligence (AI) stock bubble that’s only starting to burst, or is the latest sell-off nothing more than a healthy, much-needed correction? That’s the big question on investors’ minds as they contemplate buying the dip in previously heated growth plays that are starting to show signs of bottoming out.\n\nOf course, only time will tell if the weakness in the names that began back in July is the start of something far worse. Given the real productivity gains to be had from AI, though, I’m inclined to believe the latest dip in semiconductor and AI names is just a correction, albeit a wildly painful one.\n\nEither way, overpaying for growth stories or momentum can always entail short-term pain. Let’s examine three semiconductor stocks that are worth watching as they turn a corner after one of the nastiest month-long spills of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have been nosediving alongside the semi group in recent months, shedding close to 43% of their value in around a month. That’s an excruciatingly painful crash that weighed heavily on chasers of the semi design firm.\n\nDespite the implosion, ARM stock is still up around 80% year-to-date (YTD). So, while the crash was sudden and vicious, it wasn’t quite as sizable as the parabolic rally that preceded it. As Arm Holdings outmuscles x86 architecture in modern PCs, it moves forward with launch plans of its very own chip next year. The latest ARM stock crash has created a great entry point for investors seeking more of a front-row seat to the AI boom.\n\nSure, the latest quarterly royalty revenues came up short, thanks to softness in IoT. However, the long-term narrative remains impressive, especially if you believe Arm Holdings is the way of the future.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has been quick to recover, with shares now up close to 15% from August lows. Undoubtedly, the $727 billion semi giant is starring at a massive $150 billion AI chip opportunity, at least according to the bulls over at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).\n\nAccording to the big bank, the fast-recovering semi firm seems to be experiencing “accelerating AI fundamentals” along with strength in its “non-AI semiconductor business” lately.\n\nThough it seems unlikely that growth will accelerate in an Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fashion, it’s hard not to be excited about the firm as it expands its reach in one of the most explosive markets out there. Time will tell if the chip giant has reached some sort of growth inflection point. Either way, 24.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) seems way too cheap, given how the firm has positioned itself on AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares are still down 25% from recent highs after tumbling alongside most other AI and semi stocks in recent months. Though the company’s impressive new slate of Arm-powered PC chips has the potential to power growth as more people upgrade to the AI PC age, the company could lose major business from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) if the San Diego-based tech titan is successful with its own modem project.\n\nUndoubtedly, Apple experienced great difficulty in swapping out Qualcomm modems for its own. The iPhone maker still hasn’t given up, though. Recently, Wolfe Research stated that an Apple modem “is indeed coming.” It’s uncertain how much progress Apple has made since it extended a new modem deal through 2026. But, there’s a big risk that another extension will be off the table come 2027.\n\nEven if the Apple modem is ready to go in 2027 or 2028, Qualcomm has plenty of time to diversify its business to offset the impact of lost sales. Therefore, the 21.6 times trailing P/E multiple seems like a bargain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple.

However, most focus on AI that has human-level intelligence with the ability to learn on its own. AGI holds the potential to transform businesses in every sector and industry.\n\nSeveral technology giants are already racing to develop AGI. It's impossible to know which one will be the first to achieve success or which will be the biggest winner. However, I think one company will profit tremendously from AGI in nearly any scenario: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for powering AI apps today. The company's heavy investments in research and development should keep it on top. AGI will likely require more powerful processing than current AI models. Nvidia's revenue and profits should skyrocket whenever the technology becomes available.\n\n2. Islet cell therapy\n\nIslet cell therapy involves transplanting islet cells from a pancreas into a patient's liver. These transplanted islet cells produce insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. The therapy holds the potential to cure type 1 diabetes (T1D).\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) is the leader in developing a cure for T1D using islet cell therapy: The big biopharmaceutical company's pipeline features two T1D programs in phase 1/2 clinical studies: VX-880 and VX-264.\n\nVertex's early testing has already demonstrated tremendous potential for VX-880 in curing T1D. VX-264 is even more promising because it doesn't require the use of immunosuppressants as VX-880 does.\n\nStory continues\n\nAround 3.8 million patients in North America and Europe have T1D. A cure would almost certainly generate billions of dollars in sales. In the meantime, Vertex has huge growth opportunities with its cystic fibrosis franchise, gene-editing therapy Casgevy, and non-opioid pain drug suzetrigine, which could win U.S. approval by Jan. 30, 2025.\n\n3. Quantum computing\n\nQuantum mechanics can make your head spin. Tiny particles can exist in multiple states at the same time and be connected (or entangled) with other particles even if they're far apart. But it's also at the heart of quantum computing, a new type of computing that's significantly more powerful than current computers.\n\nMany companies are scrambling to develop quantum computers. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is arguably in the best position as of now. Google has set six key milestones in its quantum computing roadmap. It's already achieved two of them.\n\nGoogle believes it could develop a \"useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" by the end of this decade. The opportunities for quantum computing are enormous, including transforming drug development, designing new materials, modeling climate systems, and powering AI models.\n\n4. 6G wireless networks\n\n5G wireless networks have increased bandwidth significantly compared to previous wireless technologies. However, the future will be focused on 6G. This next generation of wireless technology will support data exchanges of up to 1 terabit per second (100 times faster than 5G networks).\n\n6G should open up multiple new opportunities. Holographic communications could be possible. Augmented reality and virtual reality could become more realistic. As you might expect, many companies should benefit from 6G. I think Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) will be among the biggest winners.\n\nThe introduction of 6G technology would almost certainly kick off a massive iPhone upgrade supercycle. This would further boost Apple's revenue and profits through increased adoption of the company's services.\n\nWhen will 6G be available? A broad commercial rollout is expected by 2030. While that's still several years away, Apple's launch of Apple Intelligence, which bundles new generative AI features, could fuel growth in the meantime.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Shares in Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) and Heico jumped in premarket trading Thursday after new securities filings revealed that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway B (NYSE:BRKb) (NYSE:BRKa) had bought these stocks during the second quarter.\n\nAt the same time, the conglomerate trimmed its stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) during the quarter, while also divesting stakes in some companies completely.\n\nShares in Ulta Beauty and Heico popped more than 16% and 8% in Thursday’s premarket trade, respectively.\n\nPer 13-F filings released Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway purchased approximately 690,000 shares of Ulta Beauty, valued at about $266 million as of June 30. The company also acquired around one million shares of Heico Corp.\n\nMeanwhile, the filing also confirmed Berkshire's complete exit from Paramount Global, a rare misstep for Buffett. He acknowledged selling all shares in Paramount Global Class B (NASDAQ:PARA) at a loss during the Berkshire annual shareholder meeting in May, having offloaded a significant portion of that stake in the first quarter.\n\nBerkshire also sold its entire position in the technology firm Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW). By the end of Q1, Berkshire had held 6.1 million shares in SNOW, valued at around $989 million.\n\nBy the close of Q2, Berkshire had nearly halved its Apple stake to 400,000 shares, valued at $84.2 billion, consistent with its Q2 earnings report. Buffett had previously reduced his Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter, though the tech giant still represents about a third of Berkshire's overall portfolio.\n\nIt’s important to note that 13-F filings only serve as a snapshot of portfolio holdings as of the end of the quarter. This filing doesn't account for transactions made after June, such as the sale of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) shares in July. Moreover, it doesn’t include details on gains or losses from any sales.\n\nIn other notable moves, Berkshire sold nearly 4.3 million shares of Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), though the energy giant’s share of the Berkshire portfolio increased to 6.6% as of June 30 when compared to 5.8% at the end of Q1.\n\nBuffett’s conglomerate also reduced its holdings in Capital One by about 2.6 million shares, Floor&Decor Holdings Inc (NYSE:FND) by over 800,000 shares, and T-Mobile US Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) by roughly 570,000 shares.\n\nOn the buying side, Buffett added 7.2 million more shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), bringing the total stake to around 255 million shares, valued at nearly $16 billion, or 5.7% of the portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, he increased its position in Chubb (NYSE:CB) Limited by over 1.1 million shares, taking the total to 27 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThese stocks are surging as Warren Buffett reveals new stakes\n\nEarnings call: Dolphin Entertainment sets revenue record, eyes sports sector\n\nEarnings call: AST SpaceMobile updates on Q2 2024 progress\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds continued to buy into some of the biggest technology companies including Apple Inc. in the second quarter while trimming positions in Nvidia Corp., as they reshuffle their positions in the artificial intelligence boom that had fueled a blistering rally in the US stock market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nThe iPhone maker saw the biggest increase by market value for a single stock in the three months through the end of June, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of data from 13F filings. The stock soared nearly 25% during the period, attracting an aggregated net buy of more than 8.5 million shares from hedge funds. Janus Henderson Group Plc and Third Point LLC were among funds that added Apple. Shares in the company edged higher, rising 0.2% in premarket trading.\n\nHedge funds also boosted their exposures in other AI-related companies like Amazon.com Inc and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, according to the data. At the same time, funds sold shares in AI darling Nvidia Corp. in the second quarter as they took their profit from the frenetic rally. Microsoft Corp. was cut or reduced by 140 investors, the biggest such reduction.\n\nMichael Burry’s Scion Asset Management continued to boost its stake in China’s tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., while slashing his overall equity portfolio in half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe shift in hedge fund holdings came as the S&P 500 Index climbed 3.9% in the second quarter, adding to a 14% rally during the first half of 2024 aided by a resilient economy and solid corporate earnings. But conditions have since changed. In July, Wall Street managers started to move out of large-cap names and piled into smaller and riskier sectors. And global stock markets were hit by a massive selloff at the beginning of the month, driven by worries about a US economic slowdown and a bubble in AI.\n\nBloomberg has so far analyzed 13F filings by 674 hedge funds. Their combined holdings amounted to $443.46 billion, compared with $427.22 billion held by the same funds three months earlier.\n\nTechnology accounted for the biggest weighting in hedge fund portfolios, at 27%, followed by Consumer Discretionary, at 16%. The value of investments in Communications fell by the most for any industry. The biggest increase was for Technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrian Fund Management LP sold 29.69 million shares in Walt Disney, the biggest reduction by the investor group; Twin Tree Management LP sold 512,934 shares Tairen Capital Ltd added 2.8 million shares in Apple, the largest increase; Renaissance Technologies LLC added 1.31 million shares Reverence Capital Partners LP added 23.2 million shares in New York Community Bancorp, the largest increase; Renaissance Technologies LLC added 1.25 million shares Microsoft was cut or reduced by 140 investors, the biggest such number; Amazon.com was increased or initiated by 166 investors, the biggest tally Microsoft was the most valuable overall holding at $26.24 billion Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed that it took a new stake in Ulta Beauty Inc. and increased its stake in Sirius XM Holdings Inc.\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates with stock move in paragraph two.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now",
        "content": "The stock market has fluctuated and reshuffled a lot since the start of last year. A surge in artificial intelligence (AI) has shed light on the vast potential of tech stocks, rallying investors and boosting the Nasdaq Composite by more than 60% since Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) secured its position as the world's most valuable company by market cap in 2011 and held that spot consistently until this year. The tech giant temporarily lost the top position between January and June of 2024 when Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) surpassed Apple, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly achieved a market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nHowever, Apple's market cap of $3.3 trillion has seen it once again become the world's most valuable company. Yet, Microsoft and Nvidia continue to nip at its heels and could overtake the company for good in the coming years.\n\nMicrosoft's diversified business model and increasingly established position in AI indicate it could have a more reliable position in tech. Meanwhile, Nvidia's nearly unrivaled dominance in the chip market appears to be the gift that keeps on giving as demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to soar.\n\nSo, here are two stocks that I predict will be worth more than Apple five years from now.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's market cap was $360 billion at the start of 2023 and is now $2.6 trillion, delivering an impressive growth spurt.\n\nThe company has consistently outperformed Apple in stock growth over the last five years, with its share price up 2,600% compared to the iPhone maker's 330% rise. And that trend is unlikely to slow anytime soon. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis chart shows the massive difference in financial growth Nvidia and Apple have experienced over just the last year. While these companies are both leaders in tech, their businesses differ significantly.\n\nNvidia is profiting from soaring demand for chips, specifically its GPUs. These chips power many products, from cloud platforms to AI models, personal computers, game development engines, and more. Meanwhile, Nvidia has achieved an estimated 70% to 95% market share in GPUs.\n\nTechnological advances are only likely to continue increasing the demand for powerful chips as companies work to improve their hardware and software offerings. Conversely, Apple has struggled to attract new customers to its products over the last year, with its iPhone and Mac revenue down 10% and 8%, respectively.\n\nApple is working to expand in AI and will launch a major software update this fall called Apple Intelligence. The update will overhaul its operating systems, introducing various generative features. The company hopes Apple Intelligence will convince millions of consumers to upgrade their devices, as the features will only be accessible with newer products. While the software could boost earnings for the current fiscal year, how Apple will profit from AI over the long term remains to be seen.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia maintains a crucial role in the industry as a leading chipmaker, a position that will likely see it surpass Apple by market cap over the next five years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nFor years, Microsoft has played second fiddle to Apple on the list of most valuable companies. Apple has consistently outperformed the Windows company in stock growth, rising 330% since 2019 compared to Microsoft's 195%.\n\nHowever, that trend has shifted in 2024. Microsoft's share price is up 12% year to date, with Apple's up 8%. It's not a huge difference, but Microsoft's head start in AI and potent position in software will likely see it continue to outperform its rival.\n\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion in spending. Meanwhile, Microsoft's diverse business model grants it multiple ways to monetize its AI products, thanks to homegrown brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Bing, Xbox, and LinkedIn.\n\nSince the start of 2023, the company has introduced generative features across its product lineup. This includes new productivity tools on Windows and its Office productivity suite, a revamp of Bing, and multiple AI solutions on its cloud platform Azure. Microsoft has also begun recouping some of its hefty investment in AI, attracting new members to Azure and Microsoft 365. Their respective segments have enjoyed year-over-year sales rises of 12% and 20% in 2024. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft is outperforming Apple in earnings growth. Over the last three years, Microsoft's quarterly revenue and operating income have risen far higher than Apple's.\n\nMicrosoft became a behemoth in tech thanks to its success in software. The emergence of AI has given it the opportunity for its unique skill set and product range to shine. The company arguably has more growth potential in AI, which could allow it to overtake Apple in market value before the end of the decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How the empire that Google built could be remade following monopoly ruling",
        "content": "The Justice Department successfully argued that Google acted as an illegal monopoly. Now comes the tricky part: Deciding what to do about it.\n\nDOJ attorneys are considering a number of options they could propose to US District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta as early as next month, according to reporting by Bloomberg and the New York Times.\n\nThe remedies range from an outright breakup of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to forcing the company to make its search engine data available to competitors to ending agreements that secure its search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers.\n\nThe DOJ and Google have until Sept. 4 to propose these or other changes to Mehta, who ruled earlier this month that the tech giant violated antitrust law. A hearing to discuss next steps is set for Sept. 6.\n\n\"I think it's going to be more complicated coming up with injunctive relief than it was finding the liability,\" antitrust attorney Carl Hittinger said. Google CEO Sundar Pichai leaves a federal courthouse in Washington, DC, last October after closing arguments in the antitrust case against Google. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe remedies proposed by prosecutors could remake the market for online search, or have little impact at all, according to legal experts, depending on what takes place over the coming months.\n\nGoogle has promised to appeal. And its lawyers could ask Judge Mehta to hold off on any orders to alter its behavior while it challenges his ruling in DC’s Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"We’ve passed a key milestone, but there’s still a lot of history to be written,\" a spokesman for Google search rival DuckDuckGo wrote in a statement following the district court's ruling.\n\nThe judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law, on appeal.\n\nAnd even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders, to better ensure competition is restored to the two markets.\n\nA breakup\n\nCertainly a breakup of Google’s empire has the most potential to re-order the tech universe. That could include divestitures of its Android operating system, Chrome browser, or AdWords platform — all of which steer users into Google search.\n\nAny one of the three solutions would rip away a multi-billion dollar revenue stream from the tech giant, plus cut off data that fuels its broader search and advertising ecosystem.\n\nLegal experts disagree about whether this will actually happen. Hittinger said it’s unlikely because Judge Mehta must select a remedy that best serves the public interest.\n\n\"You can't just yank the rug out from under the American public that's been using Google's service, now ingrained in our culture, without a substitute,\" Hittinger said. \"Unless other competitors have a platform which is the same or better than Google, what's the public supposed to use in the meantime?\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe instead expects Judge Mehta to fashion a remedy similar to the one imposed against Xerox (XRX) in 1975 to end its dominance of the office-copier market. IN 1964 Xerox CEO Joseph Wilson holds 2400 copies of an original reproduced in one hour on a new Xerox copier. (AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company opened up its ecosystem by no longer allowing it to configure its copiers so that ink cartridge suppliers and other third party components could not run on its machines.\n\nBut Bill Baer, former attorney general for the Justice Department's antitrust division, said he could foresee Judge Mehta requiring Google to divest Android or Chrome.\n\n\"The judge, in order to make this remedy meaningful, is going to have to do something that allows competition to flourish,\" Baer said.\n\n\"Because they're a monopolist, they charge the advertisers, who in turn charge us, a whole lot more than if the market were competitive.\"\n\nSharing data with rivals\n\nThe judge could also force Google to share more search data with rivals and force it to offer choice screens to device owners and browser users so that they can pick their preferred search engine.\n\nA spokesman for Google search rival, DuckDuckGo, told Yahoo Finance before the trial that the company hoped remedies would require Google to share click & query data.\n\nThe data, which helps search engines track what users are searching and how they navigate to a particular website, could help DuckDuckGo and other more privacy-oriented search engines compete against Google.\n\nUnlike Google, DuckDuckGo does not assemble user search profiles or search histories and then use that data to target users with advertisements.\n\nTim McGinn, an antitrust litigation attorney with Gunster, predicted that remedies would require mobile devices, browsers, and wireless carriers to let consumers choose between Google, Bing (MSFT) Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, or other platforms. Amit Mehta, left, when he was an attorney arguing before the New York State Supreme Court in 2012. He is now the federal judge who will decide remedies in the Google monopoly case.

Google pays as much as $26 billion per year to maintain its position on mobile devices like Apple and Samsung smartphones.\n\nThese agreements were at the center of Judge Mehta’s ruling, said Proskauer antitrust lawyer Colin Kass, leading him to suspect any remedies will focus on the contracts that formalize them.\n\n\"This was a relatively narrow complaint, and an even narrower ruling,” Kass said.\n\nNo 'dramatic effect'\n\nAn end to the revenue-sharing contracts would have considerable consequences for Apple (AAPL).\n\nThe contracts — which require Apple to install Google Search as the default across its Safari browser Spotlight Search and Siri — bring in an estimated $20 billion for Apple, each year.\n\nTargeted search platforms like Yelp (YELP) and Amazon (AMZN) could also benefit from fewer search users being automatically directed to Google.\n\nOn the other hand, McGinn said, device manufacturers and browser services could choose Google as a default even if a court blocks Google from default placement agreements.\n\nPlus, he said, it's possible that the court could still allow Google to secure default placements for search, but under new, non-exclusive contracts that don’t raise antitrust concerns.\n\nEven if Google were forced to divest search-related entities, or unravel contracts for default placement, these moves may not have a dramatic effect on the company, according to Jeffries senior analyst Brent Thill.\n\nIts bigger threats, Thill said, are from new AI-assisted search engines and recent gains made by rival Meta in attracting advertisers.\n\n\"I don't think spinning off a browser or an Android operating system is going to have a dramatic impact on the company,\" Thill said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google's new phone is more about showcasing its AI than the device itself",
        "content": "This article first appeared in the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. Get the newsletter sent directly to your inbox every week by subscribing here.\n\nGoogle unveiled a variety of new hardware products during its Made by Google event at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters on Tuesday.\n\nThe devices, which include its Pixel 9 lineup, complete with the foldable Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel Watch 3 (with new health and safety features), and Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds, arrive roughly a month ahead of Apple’s annual iPhone event.\n\nGoogle (GOOG) almost certainly scheduled the show to get in front of Apple’s (AAPL) yearly hype train, ensuring its products are top of mind for at least a few weeks. But, in some ways, selling hardware isn’t exactly the main point of the search giant’s newest devices.\n\nSure, Google isn’t going to sneeze at any sales. That said, the big reason behind the company’s hardware effort is to showcase its AI chops.\n\nGoogle spent a large chunk of its event, ostensibly about its new phones and accessories, providing an in-depth overview of how its generative AI-powered Gemini platform will serve as a smart assistant that’s actually, well, smart. We’re talking about doing everything from summarizing your phone calls to helping you plan for a trip.\n\nThat’s not to say that Google’s new hardware isn’t top-notch; on the contrary, not only are its phones sleeker this time around, they’re also packed with the kind of high-powered cameras, processors, and displays that, on paper, make them formidable opponents for any Android competitor, let alone Apple’s iPhone. And the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is shaping up to be one of the most interesting foldables to date.\n\nBut all of that takes a back seat to Google’s efforts to beat back Apple, Microsoft, and any other competitors as it seeks to claim its crown as the AI king.\n\nIt’s all about the AI\n\nGoogle’s Pixel line of products historically features some of the most impressive smartphones and watches on the market. But Google isn’t looking to become the world’s top device retailer. It’ll leave that to its Android partners, including Samsung and Motorola, and Apple.\n\nInstead, the company uses its hardware to show off its software capabilities. It’s done this for years via its Pixel phones and, before that, its Nexus line of devices, giving consumers and other Android manufacturers a better understanding of how its various services and platforms come together to provide a uniquely Google experience. Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a new design, along with an improved front screen and better rear cameras. (Google) (Google)\n\nAnd now, with its Pixel 9 phones, Google is angling to prove that its AI software is second to none. It’s doing this by putting Gemini, its generative AI-powered virtual assistant, front and center. Now when users say, “Hey, Google,” or long-press their phones’ power buttons, they’ll bring up Gemini rather than the company’s old Google Assistant.\n\nStory continues\n\nGemini promises a number of new, intriguing possibilities, including being able to easily pull information from other apps via app extensions. Right now, the company is focusing on its first-party apps, including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Calendar, and will integrate extensions into YouTube Music, Keeps, and Tasks in the future. The idea is for Gemini to “talk” to your apps so that you don’t have to.\n\nFor example, Google says you’ll be able to ask Gemini to check your Gmail for the time and location of your friend’s surprise birthday party. The assistant will then pull the evite from your Gmail and provide you with all of the relevant information without you ever having to open the app. You can then ask Gemini to tell you how long it will take to get to the party, and it will pull up an estimate along with the route to take there via Google Maps.\n\nTake a picture of a concert poster, and you’ll be able to ask Google if you can make the show when the artist is in town. Google will then check your calendar to see if you have any conflicting events and let you know if you’ll be able to make it or not.\n\nIn another example, Google showed how a user could watch a clip of someone crocheting flowers on YouTube and then ask Gemini to teach them to crochet the same kind of flowers. Or, if you’re planning a trip to London and watching a travel vlog about the city’s restaurants to find the best to visit, you can ask about all of the locations the video mentions and add them to Google Maps so you’re ready with a host of dinner options when you land.\n\nChatting with Gemini, for a price\n\nGoogle is also rolling out its Gemini Live service to iPhone and English Android users with Gemini Advanced subscriptions in the coming weeks. The feature is built into Gemini and allows you to speak to the assistant in real time as if you’re having a conversation with someone over the phone.\n\nIt’s difficult to tell how well these options will play with consumers. Sure, I can see asking Gemini to grab info from my Gmail or get directions in Maps, but I’m not too sure I’m likely to talk to Gemini Live any more than I talk to the Google Assistant or Apple’s Siri now, which is sparingly. Beating Apple to the AI punch? CEO Tim Cook at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in June. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nI generally use both assistants to do little more than check the score of last night’s Mets game or set a timer for whatever I’m cooking in the oven. And to subscribe to Gemini Advanced, I'd need to sign up for a Google One AI Premium account for $19.99 per month. Sure, that includes 2TB of cloud storage and Gemini for Gmail and Google Docs. But that’s still a pricey proposition.\n\nAll of this comes just a few short weeks before Apple rolls out its iPhone 16 lineup, its first line of iPhones since it announced its Apple Intelligence service at its WWDC event in May.\n\nLike Gemini, Apple Intelligence is meant to work across your various apps and services, providing you with AI writing tools, summaries of emails and text message threads, and deep app integrations that can pull data from your emails and calendar. Apple is also launching a smarter version of Siri with a new look and less robotic voice.\n\nThere’s still no guarantee that any of these generative AI features will be a hit with consumers or that they’ll work as advertised. After all, there are plenty of instances of gen AI apps going awry. But if Google has its way, and Gemini lives up to expectations, its Pixel phones will act as the springboard to help turn it into the next big thing among Android users. And maybe win over some Apple fans too.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

        "title": "Apple Pushes Ahead With Tabletop Robot in Search of New Revenue",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., seeking new sources of revenue, is moving forward with development of a pricey tabletop home device that combines an iPad-like display with a robotic limb.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Boston’s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery A Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nThe company now has a team of several hundred people working on the device, which uses a thin robotic arm to move around a large screen, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The product, which relies on actuators to tilt the display up and down and make it spin 360 degrees, would offer a twist on home products like Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo Show 10 and Meta Platforms Inc.’s discontinued Portal.\n\nThe device is envisioned as a smart home command center, videoconferencing machine and remote-controlled home security tool, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work isn’t public. The project — codenamed J595 — was approved by Apple’s executive team in 2022 but has started to formally ramp up in recent months, they said.\n\nThe shift into robotics is part of a broader effort to boost sales and capitalize on Apple Intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence technology that’s coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac this year. The company also is seeking new growth opportunities after ending efforts to develop a self-driving car earlier this year.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple’s industrial design team has been exploring tabletop robotic concepts for years, but there wasn’t consensus within the company — including the software engineering organization and marketing teams — over whether to move forward.\n\nApple’s marketing group was concerned that consumers wouldn’t be willing to pay for such a product. Top software engineering executives, meanwhile, fretted about the staffing resources it would require to build the necessary software. But Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is seen as a proponent of the device — as is John Ternus, the company’s head of hardware engineering.\n\nApple has now decided to prioritize the device’s development and is aiming for a debut as early as 2026 or 2027, according to the people. The company is looking to get the price down to around $1,000. But with years to go before an expected release, the plans could theoretically change.\n\nIn a sign of support, Apple has made the project the sole responsibility of Kevin Lynch, a veteran executive. He serves as vice president of technology and oversaw the self-driving car and, until recently, Apple’s smartwatch and health software engineering efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nLynch recently enlisted key lieutenants who helped launch the Apple Watch to work on the tabletop robot, as well as well-known robotics researchers and engineers. Lynch reports to John Giannandrea, Apple’s head of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe idea is for the tabletop product to be primarily controlled using the Siri digital assistant and upcoming features in Apple Intelligence. The device could respond to commands, such as “look at me,” by repositioning the screen to focus on the person saying the words — say, during a video call. It also could understand different voices and adjust its focus accordingly. Current models in testing run a customized version of the iPad operating system.\n\nThe hardware engineering group is also involved. Matt Costello, an executive who leads development of Apple’s HomePod smart speaker, is overseeing the hardware side of the project. The company also is working on robots that move around the home and has discussed the idea of a humanoid version. Those projects are being led, in part, by Hanns Wolfram Tappeiner, a robotics expert who now has about 100 former car team engineers reporting to him.\n\nIn a job listing published this month, Apple said it has a team “working to leverage and build upon groundbreaking machine learning robotics research, thereby enabling development of generalizable and reliable robot systems.” The company said it’s seeking experts with experience in “robot manipulation” and creating AI models for robot control.\n\nLynch has been entrusted with some of Apple’s biggest projects. He was instrumental in bringing the first Apple Watch to market in 2015 and was tapped in 2021 to oversee the car effort.\n\nUnder Lynch, the car project made progress — though the product’s ambitions were also reduced along the way. But by 2024, costs had added up to at least $10 billion and the car industry suffered a slowdown. There were concerns about Apple being able to stand out in a crowded field, and management decided to shut down the initiative in a rare high-profile retreat.\n\nThe capabilities of the tabletop device have been in flux as well. Some people involved in the project say the features have been scaled back from initial ambitions, with one person describing the development process as a roller-coaster ride.\n\nOthers within Apple still question whether the device will appeal to consumers and whether the company really needs another tablet-like product. Though the new Vision Pro headset melds virtual and augmented reality, it ultimately duplicates the features of an iPad.\n\nApple also has had trouble cracking the market for smart-home devices. Its HomePod speakers haven’t sold as well as models from Amazon and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and the Apple TV set-top box lags behind Roku Inc. devices and other rivals.\n\nThe robotics effort is one of a few avenues Apple is pursuing to generate new sources of revenue.\n\nThe company is also working on augmented reality glasses, as well as exploring less ambitious products like smart glasses that would be similar to Meta’s Ray-Ban spectacles. That product — which Meta has described as a hit — stops short of offering a true AR experience but let users make phone calls and capture video.\n\nIn addition, Apple is looking to create a version of its AirPods earbuds that include cameras, letting them better sense the outside world. And it’s working on a giant, foldable iPad — something that might not arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest, according to people with knowledge of the effort.\n\nApple still gets roughly half its revenue from the iPhone, which has sold sluggishly in recent quarters. The company is planning to launch new models in September that feature better cameras, processors and displays. But that’s only expected to generate modest growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Surgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

        "title": "Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback",
        "content": "\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"was a suspenseful horror hit in the late '90s. Millennials may remember the movie and its sequel starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. The story follows four teenagers involved in a hit-and-run accident and a killer seeking revenge for an apparent murder the teens committed. A year after the accident, the teens begin receiving ominous messages from the mysterious killer.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with CMG.\n\nToday's stock market has a bit of that same feel. Recall it was last summer when the S&P 500 was in the throes of a correction. Equities peaked in late July during the heart of the second-quarter earnings season and would go on to bottom the following October. The pullback was nearly as textbook as it could get considering that U.S. large caps dipped 10% over the course of three months before resuming a broader uptrend.\n\nTroubling headlines in early August\n\nInvestors are now receiving ominous messages and reminders about volatility. Last week, the VIX Index soared above 65 for a moment following a turbulent weekend of bearish news that included confirmation of a large sell of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A),[1] reports of a delay in Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new Blackwell chips,[2] turmoil in the Japanese stock market and its yen carry trade unwind[3] and the potential for war in the Middle East.[4] All of that followed a disappointing U.S. jobs report after the Federal Reserve decided to put off its first rate cut, likely until September.[5]\n\nWhile the reasons may be much different from this time in 2023, investors likely feel as if the bears are stalking them for past misgivings as we venture further into a historically weak period on the calendar. And we see selling pressure among a handful of once-hot individual stocks that announced splits earlier this year.\n\nThe appeal of stock splits\n\nThe media often discuss stock splits in a positive light. After all, the reason a management team elects to divide its existing shares into multiple shares is commonly as a result of a previous run-up in the stock. A traditional split can increase trading liquidity, and it may have certain psychological benefits as investors may perceive a lower-priced stock as more accessible, even if the company's fundamental value hasn't changed. Stock splits can even be implemented to make shares more affordable for employees in certain stock-based compensation plans.\n\nMore splitters\n\nTraditional stock splits were back in vogue last quarter. Second-quarter 2024 featured 29 split announcements the highest in three years. It's not surprising considering that markets were in rally mode, led by strength in U.S. large caps. The third quarter is already tracking well with 10 split announcements as of Aug. 7.\n\nSecond quarter marked a three-year high in traditional stock-split announcements Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nDigging into the anomaly\n\nResearch shows that stocks that split tend to beat their primary index, but the alpha trend has waned over the years as the anomaly has become more widely understood. BofA Global Research reports that since 2010, stocks that have split have posted a 12-month forward return five percentage points above the index. While that's strong, it's far short of the 10-percentage-point-plus positive gap seen in previous decades.\n\nStocks that split have historically outperformed Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: BofA Global Research\n\nMore recent figures from Goldman Sachs, using FactSet data, reveal that in the past five years, the stock-split halo has been even less powerful. Average excess returns among splitters are essentially flat in the following week, month and three-month periods.\n\nThe stock split announcement effect has disappeared recently Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Goldman Sachs\n\nA changing market\n\nWhy aren't we seeing the outperformance of yesteryear? Well, information is more easily available today and the advent of fractional-share trading along with markets that are perhaps more efficient at least partially negates the halo effect of a stock split. There are also fewer splits as higher share prices are now accepted, and many large companies are not as concerned about needing to appeal to retail investors due to large institutional shareholder bases.\n\nStock-split stars hit the skids\n\nTurning to recent market action, let's follow four of this year's highest-profile stock splitters. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), NVDA, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) each announced splits, the first being Chipotle back on March 19. Nvidia followed with a 10:1 on May 22, then came MicroStrategy's 10:1 on July 11 and Super Micro joined the party on Aug. 8.\n\nThrough last Wednesday, all of those stocks were mired in steep drawdowns. Notice in the graph below that the best performer was Chipotle down 22% from its mid-June peak. Nvidia was the poster child for the artificial intelligence-fueled bull market from late 2022 through the first half of 2024, but the mega-cap is now well into bear-market territory. MicroStrategy, often included in the same conversation as crypto, tested its March peak last month, but has since plunged more than 30%. Super Micro, another AI play, reacted harshly after its quarterly earnings report and stock-split announcement on Aug. 6.\n\n2024 drawdowns: CMG, NVDA, MSTR, SMCI down sharply from year-to-date highs despite split announcements Sour Stock-Split Performances Amid a Possible Sequel to Last Year's Pullback\n\nSource: Koyfin Charts\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere's a feeling of deja vu in markets today. The S&P 500 fell about 10% from late July through early fourth quarter last year, and that followed downside price action over a similar stretch in 2022. This year, the bears have asserted themselves after the bulls controlled the first half. Shares of companies that recently announced stock splits are well off their highs, generally not benefiting from the historical trend of outperformance.\n\n1 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway Slashes Apple Stake, The Wall Street Journal, Karen Langley, August 3, 2024, https://www.wsj.com2 Nvidia Investors Grapple With Delay to Next Generation AI Chip, The Wall Street Journal, Tom Dotan, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com3 Why the Yen Carry Trade Unwind Has Further to Go, The Wall Street Journal, Chelsey Dulaney, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com4 Mideast Braces for More Violence Amid Warnings of Iranian Attack, The Wall Street Journal, Laurence Norman, Benjamin Katz, Feliz Soloman, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com5 Market Selloff Upends Fed Rate-Cut Calculus, The Wall Street Journal, Nick Timiraos, August 5, 2024, https://www.wsj.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "title": "Google’s AI future depends on Android—a DOJ threat to split it off creates an existential crisis",
        "content": "Last week, a U.S. judge ruled that Google was breaking antitrust law by paying the likes of Apple and Samsung tens of billions of dollars to shore up its illegal monopoly in web search by making Google Search the preinstalled default option in their devices and browsers.\n\nHowever, Judge Amit Mehta has yet to rule what the solution—or “remedy” in antitrust-speak—to this lawbreaking should be. In theory, it could be something relatively mild, like making Google share its search data with rival providers. Mehta could order Google to stop paying device-makers like Apple. But according to Bloomberg’s sources, the Justice Department is also considering the nuclear option: breaking up Google.\n\nThat could reportedly mean forcing Google to divest its Android mobile operating system or its Chrome browser, both of which are central to the dominance of Google Search—the go-to tool for more than 90% of American search queries. A divestment of the Google Ads platform is reportedly also under consideration.\n\nUnsurprisingly, investors in Google parent Alphabet have not greeted Bloomberg’s report warmly. Shares fell by more than 3% on Wednesday morning, before recovering slightly.\n\nThey might have fallen further, were it not for the fact that a wholesale breakup of a Big Tech company would be unprecedented, making it difficult to imagine. (U.K. antitrust regulators did force Meta to unwind its acquisition of the GIF repository Giphy a couple years back, but Giphy—now owned by Shutterstock—wasn’t exactly core to Meta’s business.)\n\nThe idea of a Big Tech breakup is not unprecedented, though.\n\nNearly a quarter-century ago, Microsoft had also been found to be abusing a monopolistic position—in that case, in the market for PC operating systems. It was a time at which the web was taking off, and Microsoft broke antitrust law by bundling its own Internet Explorer bundle with Windows, to stymie the advance of third-party browsers like Marc Andreessen’s Netscape Navigator.\n\nA district court ordered the breakup of Microsoft into a Windows unit and a separate unit that would have handled other Microsoft software, like Internet Explorer. But Microsoft appealed and won, at least to the extent that it no longer faced breakup as a remedy; it ended up settling the antitrust case in 2001 with promises to let manufacturers ship Windows PCs with other operating systems and Microsoft-rivaling software, without retaliation.\n\nMicrosoft’s narrow escape—partly the result of improper public statements made by the judge during the initial trial—means that the most recent example in U.S. antitrust history of a major corporate breakup occurred more than 40 years ago, when telco giant AT&T was split into a long-distance carrier and seven so-called Baby Bells.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut, while Big Tech has never had to experience a dismemberment on that scale, times are changing. Companies like Google, Apple, and Meta have unprecedented scale and power on a global level and an outsize role in the stock markets, and there’s plenty of political will to rein them in. Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ’s aggressive antitrust chief, has been arguing for many years that the only way to address Google’s alleged violations is to break it up—a stance that did not hinder his appointment as assistant attorney general for antitrust in late 2021.\n\nThe impact of a breakup would resonate far beyond Mountain View\n\nThe odds of a Google breakup are still long, given the company’s expected appeal of the ruling, and if the decision is upheld, the many, less-draconian alternative remedies for Judge Mehta to consider.\n\nBut in the unlikely event that Judge Mehta agreed to take the divestiture route, the result would be seismic. And for Google, which currently enjoys a market valuation of close to $2 trillion, an existential crisis.\n\nAnything that directly reduces Google’s search revenues—still by far the company’s biggest cash cow—would hurt. While Chrome and Android are not explicitly search products, they each serve as a vital point of connection to consumers: Chrome holds nearly two-thirds of the global browser market, and Android a slightly larger share of the global smartphone market. If either were to cease being a Google product, Google would have less ability to steer consumers to its moneymaking services (like search advertising).\n\nAnd if the future of consumer tech is nearly as AI-centric as the industry claims, an Android-less Google would also find itself hobbled in this critical arena.\n\nJust yesterday, Google held a splashy event to show off its latest lineup of hardware products, including Google Pixel smartphones. As the event made clear, these devices, as well as the broader ecosystem of third-party Android hardware products, are the most important vehicle for Google’s AI ambitions—without Android, Google has no obvious way to ensure that billions of people get to interact with its Gemini-powered chatbots and other AI services on a daily basis. (Indeed, one can imagine Google’s leverage of Android to promote Gemini being the kind of issue that could inspire a future antitrust suit in the U.S. or elsewhere.)\n\nThe impact of a Google breakup would also be felt far beyond Mountain View, as Google and plenty of its peers are also embroiled in other antitrust cases that could theoretically lead to a similar outcome.\n\nThe DOJ currently has a separate case against Google that, it hopes, could result in Google having to sell off parts of its ad-tech operations. The Federal Trade Commission has a lawsuit going against Meta that aims for the divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC also has a complaint against Amazon that, some experts have suggested, could result in the spinning-off of the e-commerce giant’s logistics services.\n\nSo, thanks to its timing, Google’s antitrust loss on the search front could end up being the tipping point for a grand humbling of Big Tech. If the company prevails, it could provide the precedent to demonstrate that these behemoths cannot be cut down to size—a demonstration tech companies no doubt hope would scare off regulators for another couple of decades.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "'Sheriff of Silicon Valley': How Kamala Harris's tenure as California AG could shape her approach to Big Tech",
        "content": "During Kamala Harris’s stint as California’s top prosecutor, few knew her better than Travis LeBlanc — the special assistant attorney general of California and one of her most senior advisers.\n\nWhile working for Harris, LeBlanc’s responsibilities included tech regulation, cybersecurity, privacy, and antitrust. Yahoo Finance spoke to LeBlanc exclusively about Harris's moves during her tenure from 2011 to 2017, including her business track record and pro-growth approach to tech companies.\n\n“She is mindful that there are large players and small players in tech, and those aren't the same,” LeBlanc said. “One of the biggest concerns is that disruptors are given an opportunity to succeed, and that they aren't squelched by either an incumbent or a very large player in the market before they've had a chance to flourish.”\n\nInsight into a Harris administration\n\nLast week, the US Dept. of Justice ruled that Google (GOOGL, GOOG) violated an antitrust law with its search business. The ruling, a major victory for the Biden administration, could serve as a template for future cases. However, Harris has so far stayed silent on what an antitrust environment would look like if she were elected president.\n\nLeBlanc said one of Harris's biggest goals has always been “giving disruptors an opportunity to compete, recognizing that the incentives of incumbents and larger companies may be to use the power of the government to help exclude them from competing in the marketplace.”\n\nIn 2012, Harris sued and reached a $3.75 million settlement with eBay (EBAY) over allegations the company violated anti-competitive laws regarding a no-poaching agreement with Intuit.\n\nOne of the biggest antitrust cases Harris handled came in late 2011 when she successfully blocked AT&T’s buyout of T-Mobile’s US operations. At the time, Harris joined 10 other states that banded together following several meetings with AT&T's leadership.\n\n“That was a very big deal,” LeBlanc said. “T-Mobile used that to become the T-Mobile that we know of today. They now compete directly with AT&T and Verizon.”\n\nWhile her prosecutorial record in California provides some hints on how she would run the country, LeBlanc and several former staffers Yahoo Finance spoke to describe Harris as an effective communicator who wouldn’t always use litigation as a tool.\n\nOne of Harris's key accomplishments as attorney general was in 2012 when her office reached an agreement with six tech giants: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google, Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ), and Research In Motion, requiring the companies to include clear privacy policies for users before they downloaded apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I can't imagine that today those companies would all sign an agreement with any attorney general or department of justice,” LeBlanc said. “It was a real testament to her ability to convene, to work with the stakeholders, and to try and achieve a resolution that would benefit everyone.”\n\nAs vice president, Harris has played a key role in the Biden administration’s efforts around artificial intelligence.\n\n“President Biden and I reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation,” Harris said at the Global Summit on AI Safety in London last year. “We can and we must do both.”\n\nLeBlanc said a Harris administration would likely continue parts of Biden’s AI policies, adding she will “be mindful that the technology is evolving, and if we're going to regulate it, we need to do so in a way that’s nimble, so that we don't end up impeding the progress of technology in the future in ways that no one intended today.” Vice President Kamala Harris swearing in Travis LeBlanc to his second term on the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in October 2022. (Twitter.com/VP)\n\nBig Tech vs the FTC\n\nWhen Harris was running to become California’s attorney general in 2010, wealthy supporters included Salesforce (CRM)’s Marc Benioff, Apple’s Jony Ive, Meta (META)’s Sheryl Sandberg, and the wife of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs (who is also the founder and president of Emerson Collective).\n\nOn Sunday, Harris returned to the city where her political career began for a fundraiser. It was her first trip back to San Francisco since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket. “This is a room full of dear, dear, dear friends,” Harris said to the gathering of Silicon Valley elites. She raised $13 million that day.\n\nThe pro-Harris movement in tech includes donations and endorsements from Netflix (NFLX)’s Reed Hastings, Sheryl Sandberg, Box (BOX)’s Aaron Levie, Khosla Venture's Vinod Khosla, and Melinda French Gates, among others.\n\nBut Harris faces a delicate balance between appeasing her donors and regulating the tech industry. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who donated $7 million to her campaign, told CNN last month that if Harris is elected she should replace Lina Khan, head of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nKhan’s term expires in September and her future as FTC chair remains unknown. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft — a company with a history of clashing with the FTC. According to Hoffman, Harris should elect a new antitrust chief, as Khan is “waging a war on American business.”\n\nWhen asked if Hoffman or the opinion of her deep-pocketed tech donors would impact Harris's decision on who should lead the FTC, LeBlanc said, “I think she will ultimately make any personnel decisions based on who she thinks is the right person for the job.”\n\nFormer staffers say Harris helped shape Silicon Valley — and Silicon Valley shaped Harris, who once campaigned on being the “sheriff of Silicon Valley.” It remains to be seen if she will have the same moniker if she’s elected commander in chief.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Google’s AI-packed Pixel event showed it has the upper hand in its Apple battle—for now",
        "content": "There can be no doubt that yesterday’s big Made By Google hardware event was designed to take the wind out of Apple’s sails.\n\nGoogle typically unveils its latest Pixel smartphones in the fall, after Apple’s September iPhone reveal; we are very much still enjoying the summer. And Google missed no opportunity to praise the AI capabilities, powered by the company’s own Gemini models, in its new devices—and in other capable Android phones.\n\n“Gemini is deeply integrated with Google apps and Android and can handle complex queries without hand-off to third-party AI providers you may not know or trust,” Google said pointedly in a blog post. It was a likely reference to the fact that Apple, still lacking a powerful AI model of its own, will have to rely on OpenAI and potentially other providers for the heavyweight AI functionality in its upcoming iPhones.\n\nThere’s an element of FUD in Google’s messaging here, given that Apple has created a pretty plausible security framework for using third-party AI providers to handle queries in a trustworthy way. But nonetheless, Google does hold a clear advantage over Apple by having developed its own models.\n\nGoogle also stole a march on OpenAI by yesterday rolling out Gemini Live, its conversational chatbot, which offers very similar functionality to the voice-chat features for ChatGPT that OpenAI has demonstrated but not yet released. According to TechCrunch, Gemini Live is impressive, though it does make stuff up sometimes. The Verge says it’s prone to mansplaining.\n\nGemini Live will feature in the new Pixel Buds Pro 2 earphones, which now feature a variant of Google’s custom Tensor AI chip. This is apparently useful for better noise cancellation.\n\nOf course, the stars of the hardware show were the handsets—the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold—which run Google’s beefy Tensor G4 processor and come with not only Gemini Live, but also the multimodal version of the on-device Gemini Nano model. This should be able to handle image, audio, and speech inputs as well as text, and it will be very interesting to see how it stacks up against the on-device “Apple Intelligence” functionality in this year’s iPhones.\n\nWith Gemini Live coming to other Android handsets, including those from top manufacturer Samsung, Google’s AI efforts clearly have a lot of momentum and Apple’s response will need to be strong. Given that many Apple Intelligence features won’t be available on the upcoming iOS 18 when it first comes out, it looks like Google will have the upper hand for a while.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean all is well in Google-land. A court found last week that Google’s had used its monopolization of the online search market to break antitrust law and, while the judge is yet to detail the remedies for this lawbreaking, Bloomberg now reports that the Justice Department may push for a Google breakup. DOJ insiders told the publication that they could seek the divestment of the Android operating system and Chrome browser, and/or Google’s AdWords platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nI still can’t quite believe a Google breakup is really on the cards—the government did once try to do this to Microsoft and failed—but if Google were to lose control of Android, that could mean losing the primary vehicle for its AI ambitions. So stay tuned.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. acknowledged for the first time it’s in discussions with Apple Inc. about sharing the revenue that flows through its popular WeChat mini games, a potentially significant move for China’s mobile developer ecosystem.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money Biden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\n\nThe Chinese company is exploring ways to offer in-app transactions via Apple’s iOS payment system, Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told analysts on an earnings call. Such a change would enable the US firm to begin taking a cut of in-game transactions.\n\nApple has begun ramping up pressure on Tencent and ByteDance Ltd. to make fundamental changes to China’s most popular apps, Bloomberg News has reported. The iPhone maker in recent months demanded the two companies close loopholes that their in-app creators employ to funnel users to external payment systems, circumventing Apple’s typical 30% commission, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mitchell said Tencent does not monetize mini games via in-app purchases on iOS presently and discussions are underway to potentially enable the function, which would benefit developers, users, Apple and Tencent.\n\n“We want to make it available on terms that we think are economically sustainable, that are also fair. And so that’s a discussion that’s underway, and we hope that the discussion leads to a positive outcome,” Mitchell said. “But in the event that discussion doesn’t progress, then the current status quo continues.”\n\nWeChat sits at the heart of Tencent’s social media and gaming empire, and the all-in-one platform is shouldering a larger share of the burden for growth as divisions like cloud services struggle. Mini programs in WeChat, including games, are small pieces of software accessed through the dominant app, enabling things like booking travel tickets, paying bills and whiling away spare time playing. The company’s gross receipts from mini games increased more than 30% in the second quarter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Kamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other automation stocks.\n\n2023 was the year of generative AI, mainly because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and the resulting response that followed. Now, 2024 is the year in which companies have truly started using this ever-evolving technology. McKinsey revealed that AI supported the companies in both aspects: cost decreases and revenue jumps.\n\nAutomation Technologies- Key Trends\n\nIn 2024, the integration of automation technologies continues to revolutionize every aspect of supply chain management. This led to unprecedented levels of efficiency and agility. The global integrated automated supply chain is expected to reach US$25.6 billion by 2033, from US$13.4 billion in 2023, according to industry data by Market.us.\n\nFrom removing warehousing bottlenecks to inventory management and demand forecasting, supply chain automation reshaped traditional practices and redefined the dynamics of the logistics industry.  In inventory tracking, advanced warehouse management systems, which are powered by AI and ML algorithms, focus on optimizing inventory placement, route planning, resource allocation, etc.\n\nInventory tracking and management are being revolutionized through the usage of automation solutions, such as RFID tagging, barcode scanning, and computer vision. Real-time tracking technologies are offering granular visibility in inventory movements. This allows businesses to monitor stock levels, spot discrepancies, and manage understocking/overstocking. Manufacturers are now getting inclined towards smart factories.\n\nSmart factories reflect and demonstrate Industry 4.0 principles. They tend to leverage 5G, IoT, AI, and other advanced technologies. Experts believe that smart factories allow predictive maintenance and decision-making.\n\nAdoption of Advanced Automation\n\nA new theme is emerging in the field of automation, which is automated decision-making. Its adoption rapidly expanded beyond traditional sectors such as manufacturing and logistics. Demand for decision intelligence stems from data-driven and well-informed decision-making requirements which enhances corporate competitiveness and efficiency.\n\nAutomated decision-making is now being accepted by critical domains including healthcare and finance. In healthcare, automation supplements the clinical decision-making processes, improves patient-care delivery, and manages resource allocation. It involves leveraging AI and ML algorithms to assess patient data, medical images, and genomic sequences, and customize patient care.\n\nStory continues\n\nLikewise, in finance, automated systems continue to reshape top-notch operations like risk assessment, fraud detection, and investment management. AI algorithms assess large datasets of financial transactions and market trends to optimize investment strategies. In 2024, the software development industry is all set to embark on a remarkable transformation with cutting-edge innovations.\n\nQuantum Computing and Robotics\n\nThe latest technologies in software that are expected to reshape the landscape include quantum computing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),big data, data analytics, 5G technology, robotics, etc.\n\nQuantum computing continues to rapidly advance, evolve, and reshape scientific and industrial landscapes. Unlike classical computers—which use bits as the smallest information unit—quantum computers make use of qubits. These exploit quantum mechanics principles to perform complex and difficult calculations. For example, at the time of drug discovery, quantum algorithms simulate molecular interactions in a more accurate and refined way as compared to traditional methods. The integration of quantum computing with AI is another critical emerging trend.\n\nThe unprecedented advancements in robotics and AI are expected to bring revolutionary positive transformations. More and more sectors continue to understand the benefits of adopting robotics and AI. Globally, the robotics market should achieve healthy revenue growth, with a projected value of US$38.24 billion this year. The strongest segment in the robotics market is expected to be service robotics, which should lead in market volume. Service robotics find its application in sectors, like Healthcare, Medical, Military and Defense, Logistics, etc. while industrial robots are used in Automotive, Electronics, Food & Beverage, etc.\n\nThe trends driving the robotics market are supported by developments in emerging technologies. These include 5G, AI, Edge Computing, IIoT, cloud, open-source, etc. Since AI in robotics continues to evolve, more and more industries are exploiting the latest technologies. Therefore, manufacturers are making data-driven decisions. Some industries use self-learning robots to execute work processes.\n\nSmart factories are using AI-enabled robotics to execute smarter, reliable, and efficient processes. They help in production optimization. AI-powered robotic technologies, which include computer vision and tactile sensing, are utilized to help automate certain tasks. For example, reinforcement learning is used for better industrial assembly. The adoption of robotics, smart automation, and high-tech manufacturing will help workers with manual labor and reduce repetitive tasks.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Upside Potential: 23.95%\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates as a holding company. With the help of its subsidiaries, the company offers web-based searches, advertisements, maps, software applications, enterprise solutions, commerce, and hardware products.\n\nUiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH), which is a leading enterprise automation and AI software company, and Google Cloud announced an expanded partnership to help customers transform their enterprise with AI-powered automation. UiPath is now available on Google Cloud Marketplace. Therefore, Google Cloud customers can purchase UiPath Business Automation Platform. This will help them reliably deploy and scale automation initiatives on Google Cloud infrastructure.\n\nGoogle Cloud’s expanding partnership with UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) should create new opportunities for businesses as they will be able to streamline thousands of processes with AI and automation. These businesses will save costs and unlock new innovation.\n\nThe company has released its 2Q 2024 financial results, with total revenues coming at $84.7 billion. Of this, more than ~75% was contributed from advertising on Google Search and its other channels. As of now, investors are in a dicey situation as to what should be the next course of action after the recent Antitrust Defeat. For those who are unaware, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is the parent company of Google, lost an antitrust lawsuit in Federal court.\n\nThe $20 billion in annual payments to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), made by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for making Google the default search engine made the critical part of the case. The judge provided a ruling, wherein, he said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) illegally stifled competition in its online search market.\n\nEven though this ruling is a major setback for the company, it should be noted that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) pays billions of dollars to several other companies. These are made to make Google Search the default search engine. Since the tech giant will not pay anymore, this can help the company save billions of dollars per year. Even though it is believed that the appeals process will take several years, Google’s search market share should not reduce quickly. Apart from this, the company has included artificial intelligence features in Google. Because of this, it has collected massive amounts of user data. In 2Q 2024, the company’s capital spending went up by 91% to reach $13.18 billion. The company is playing the long game when it comes to incorporating Al-powered technologies.\n\nAnalysts at Truist Financial upped their price objective on shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $190.00 to $196.00. They have a “Buy” rating on 24th July.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s 1Q 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was part of 222 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 214 in the last quarter.\n\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter and mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here is what the fund said:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.”\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 9th on our list of best automation stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Qualcomm the Chip Stock You Need to Own Right Now?",
        "content": "A potential future trillion-dollar company, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has seen impressive interest this year. The company’s strong performance this year has been driven by its AI-powered Snapdragon processors, which work for PCs, gaming, smartphones, and automotive models. Despite the stock seeing a 20% drop over the past month and concerns regarding the U.S. economy, Qualcomm may rebound due to strong handset sales and an advantage in automotive.\n\nKnown more as a semiconductor play, Qualcomm also supports different Internet of Things applications like smart home technologies and automotive systems. Its Snapdragon processors and 5G modems drive are renowned across different sectors. Wall Street estimates that the company will reach double-digit growth through 2027.\n\nAlthough the company has put forward aggressive growth estimates, Qualcomm remains undervalued, trading at 15.6x its forward earnings guidance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm is recovering very well after its 2023 fiscal with strong revenue and earnings. The company could be a solid long-term investment, especially if shares become more affordable before 2024 ends.\n\nRobust Financials\n\nQualcomm impressed the market with its successful June quarter. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.33, revenue reached $9.39 billion, and the company’s net income surged to $2.13 billion. Qualcomm expects to report around $10.3 billion in revenue for the current quarter, slightly above Wall Street estimates of $9.71 billion.

Qualcomm highlighted its advanced Snapdragon chips as crucial for “AI smartphones” like Samsung’s latest models. CEO Cristiano Amon noted that AI has boosted demand in the premium market segment, growing faster despite overall stagnation.\n\nWhile still a smaller revenue stream, automotive chips saw an 87% rise to $811 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $641.7 million and representing a key growth area for Qualcomm.\n\nSnapdragon X Elite Mini\n\nQualcomm’s recently launch of the Snapdragon Dev Kit, a mini PC designed for developing Windows applications and AI experiences, offers an affordable alternative to the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac Mini. Primarily aimed at developers, this PC supports building, testing, and optimizing apps using the Arm64 toolchain, including Visual Studio and VS Code, while enhancing CPU, GPU and NPU performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform isn’t recommended for gaming due to subpar performance and compatibility compared to x86 gaming laptops. However, it still offers a usable Windows 11 experience and runs productivity and creative applications smoothly. It could be a suitable Mini PC option for professionals focused on developing or improving Windows on Arm games.\n\nThe Snapdragon Dev Kit, priced at $899.99, is the most affordable in the Snapdragon X series. It’s cheaper than the Surface Pro 11, which costs $989. Measuring 8x7x1.3 inches and weighing 970g, the Dev Kit is available only through Arrow. It features a black shell made from 20% recycled ocean plastic.\n\nInvestors Are Betting on QCOM\n\nAnalysts have voiced concerns about Qualcomm’s handset sales and slow AI smartphone adoption. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schaeffer cast doubts on AI’s ultimate impact on Qualcomm’s future growth, while Susquehanna’s Christopher Rolland found the core market weaker than expected but maintained a $250 price target. UBS’s David Vogt anticipated minimal iPhone revenue growth. Moreover, the company saw a $200 million quarter earnings hit from the Huawei ban.\n\nThat said, it’s clear that some investors are starting to look at this stock, given its recent decline and strong performance up until the company’s recent earnings report. If Qualcomm can continue gain steam and see real and meaningful impacts from growth in AI, this is a relatively overlooked stock I think could be attractive for long-term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a long position in AAPL.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "3 Ways to Play Warren Buffett’s 56% Apple Stake Reduction",
        "content": "One of the biggest shockers of the latest Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) quarterly unveiling was how much Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock the firm sold. Indeed, many expected Warren Buffett’s conglomerate to sell some Apple stock after trimming its stake by 13% in the first quarter. However, the reaction in Apple shares seemed to suggest that few investors saw Berkshire shedding nearly half of its stake in such a hurry.\n\nWith around 56% of the Apple stake now freshly reduced, fans of Berkshire and Buffett may now be wondering where the firm goes from here. Arguably, the Apple bet was one of Buffett’s best investments of all time.\n\nIn any case, Berkshire’s cash reserves keep growing while potential opportunities get slimmer with every upward surge. The latest market sell-off may have changed things slightly. Regardless, here are a few stocks that may make sense to pick up as Buffett’s big Apple sale worries some market participants.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple stock crumbled by close to 5% as investors reacted to the magnitude of Berkshire’s latest share sale. Undoubtedly, the move seemed mostly like a massive overreaction. Just because Buffett thinks it’s a good idea to raise cash on one of his firm’s biggest winners doesn’t mean AAPL stock is poised for weak performance.\n\nOf course, only time will tell if Buffett was right to sell in the first half of 2024. If Apple Intelligence exceeds the expectations of the many bullish analysts on Wall Street, the timing of recent sales may look ill-timed. In many ways, Apple Intelligence stands out as one of those technologies that can evolve the smartphone business.\n\nWinning the AI race isn’t just about spending money hand over fist on GPUs or achieving the model with the most parameters. It’s more about maintaining user trust, maximizing efficiencies, and, perhaps most importantly, ensuring high-quality outputs. Apple has a good shot of getting Intelligence right. And if they do, those who sell on the Berkshire sale news may have to buy back at much higher prices.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) depends greatly on the success of the Apple iPhone. The Apple component supplier has been in a tough spot, even before Berkshire unveiled that it had cut its stake in half.\n\nIn any case, Berkshire’s big Apple sale seems to be salt in the wounds of Skyworks more than anything. If Apple doesn’t experience any AI-induced refresh cycle over the medium term, Skyworks may have a tougher time bouncing back after a rough start to the year. The stock is down slightly (around 6%) this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest quarterly results from Skyworks haven’t been anything to write home about, either. Barclays analyst Tom O’Malley, who has a hold rating on SWKS stock, thought Skyworks had satisfactory numbers that came “slightly ahead” of expectations. Still, the results didn’t convince him to upgrade the name to a buy.\n\nIf you believe in the iPhone upgrade cycle, you may consider buying SWKS on the recent weakness.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Berkshire Hathaway, which initially plunged following the big Apple stake cut news, only to rally abruptly in the following sessions. At writing, BRK-B stock is now up 4% since its August lows. Undoubtedly, the Apple share sale news may have caused a bit of jitter for some Berkshire shareholders, at least initially.\n\nEven if Berkshire’s pile of cash is an ominous sign for the markets, investors can seek (relative) safety in Berkshire. Arguably, a market correction is a good thing for long-term holders of Berkshire Hathaway stock.\n\nThough there’s no guarantee that Buffett and company will be net buyers when the market takes a tumble, I’d argue that a plunge increases the chances of a ball being thrown in the legendary conglomerate’s strike zone. Buffett once said that investing is a “no-called strikes game.” Until the market starts throwing better pitches, don’t expect Berkshire to swing its bat.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in AAPL and BRK-B.

        "title": "Apple Stock Is a Strong Buy Ahead of the iPhone 16 Launch",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a formidable entity within the technology sector. The anticipation surrounding its iPhone 16 launch, especially with the integration of Apple Intelligence, underscores its strategic focus on innovation. Moreover, Foxconn’s hiring surge exemplifies the strategic preparations for the iPhone 16 launch. The addition of thousands of workers within a short time frame is vital. This increase reflects the anticipated high demand and production scale for the new iPhone model and its potential effects on Apple stock.\n\nMoreover, the hourly wage hike in August signifies Foxconn’s efforts to retain skilled labor during this critical production period. These actions directly align with Apple’s goal to ship 90 million iPhone 16 units, marking a 10% growth over the previous generation. This hiring and wage trend indicates the scale at which Apple is operating to meet market expectations. Overall, all these fundamental developments before the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 mark a solid buy signal for Apple stock.\n\nHigh Revenue Projections and Market Share Growth Opportunity Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple’s revenue from the iPhone segment will reach $485 billion by fiscal 2026, which signifies a 5% annual growth in the iPhone average selling price (ASP). This data is based on an anticipated shipment of nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. The record-setting shipment volume will breach the fiscal 2021–2022 cycle, demonstrating the strength of Apple’s product ecosystem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the relationship between shipment volume and ASP growth underscores the potential for sustained revenue increases. The projected 66–69% fraction of new iPhones among the shipments in fiscal 2025 and 2026 is higher than the previous peak. This indicates a positive product mix shift with Apple that will derive further ASP growth and boost overall profitability.\n\nFurther, Apple’s installed base of over 1.3 billion devices is a critical asset. The extended replacement cycle, averaging 4.8 years, provides a stable revenue stream as users upgrade to newer models. The introduction of Apple Intelligence, limited to 8% of the current iPhone and iPad base, will trigger a significant upgrade cycle. The forecasted annual shipment of 260–290 million iPhones is significantly higher than current market estimates. This points to Apple’s potential for increased market penetration. This dynamic, coupled with a reduction in iPad replacement cycles to 3.8 years, indicates substantial revenue growth opportunities in the coming years. This will serve as a long-term catalyst for the Apple stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid Revenue Impact from AI Integration An image showcasing 'Apple Intelligence' with the Apple Inc. logo and an iPhone supercharged by AI.\n\nSource: OpenAI\n\nThe integration of Apple Intelligence is poised to be a major growth driver. The limited backward compatibility of this AI feature will incentivize users to upgrade to newer models. This growth and a potential mini-upgrade cycle for the iPad highlight the multi-faceted revenue opportunities that AI integration presents for Apple.\n\nAdditionally, Foxconn’s recruitment of 50,000 workers and the wage increase indicate a ramp-up in production efficiency. This hiring surge is aligned with Apple’s goal to ship 90 million iPhone 16 units in the latter half of the year. The relationship between workforce expansion and production capacity is vital to meeting Apple’s ambitious shipment targets.\n\nFurther, Apple’s continued investment in its production capabilities is evident in Foxconn’s expansion efforts. The $1 billion investment in new business headquarters and a research center in Zhengzhou focuses on boosting production efficiency. These strategic investments are crucial as Apple prepares for the high demand expected with the iPhone 16 launch. MorganStanley’s (NYSE:MS) analysis projects Apple’s earnings to reach $8.70 per share by fiscal 2026, compared to $8.20 previously. The anticipated growth in iPhone shipments and ASP supports this upward revision. Thus, the top-and-bottom-line growth will uplift the valuation of Apple stock.\n\nProgressive Outlook and Market Expectations Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts’ forecast of nearly 500 million iPhone shipments over the next two years, combined with the 6% higher ASP growth, sets a strong outlook for Apple. The company’s ability to sustain a 4-5% annual iPhone ASP growth, driven by a positive mix shift towards newer models, is a key factor in its growth potential. Indeed, the introduction of Apple Intelligence and the expected upgrade cycle further support this positive outlook.\n\nLastly, despite a 3.1% annual decline in shipments in China, Apple remains a dominant player globally. The company’s market share in the first quarter of 2024 was 15.8%, though slightly lower than the previous quarter. Apple’s strategy to counter competition from local brands like Huawei and Oppo involves leveraging its premium brand and technological innovations. Finally, the stabilization of Apple’s market share in China’s high-end smartphone segment and the introduction of Apple Intelligence will drive strong upgrades. This focus on maintaining and growing market share in key regions is crucial for Apple stock’s long-term value growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: Buffett's Decision to Offload Apple and Bank of America Stock Could Pay Off In Spades. Here's Why.",
        "content": "One of the bigger storylines in financial headlines as of late revolves around some big moves made by Berkshire Hathaway CEO, Warren Buffett.\n\nAccording to Berkshire's latest quarterly earnings filing, the investment firm sold nearly half its stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Considering Apple is Berkshire's largest position by a wide margin, seeing such a significant sale of the stock warrants some attention.\n\nOn top of that, a series of recent Form 4 filings revealed that Berkshire also offloaded a good chunk of one of its favorite dividend stocks, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC).\n\nWhile this level of portfolio allocation may seem surprising to some, the Oracle of Omaha may have been signaling to investors that these moves had been in the works for quite some time.\n\nLet's break down why Buffett may have engaged in this selling activity and explore how it fits into the bigger picture as it relates to the economy.\n\nA trip down memory lane\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Buffett's investing philosophy is to buy and hold quality investments over an ultralong time horizon. In fact, Buffett once proclaimed, \"if you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.\"\n\nBuffett first bought a stake in Apple in 2016. Considering he has owned a position in the iPhone maker for less than a decade, his recent sale of Apple looks a bit curious at first glance.\n\nHowever, investors should not be too quick to forget the past. According to Berkshire's 13F filing from earlier this year, investors learned that Buffett also trimmed his Apple stake during the first quarter.\n\nDuring Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett revealed his rationale for the Apple sale. Per usual, his reasoning was quite simple and not wrapped up in mystery whatsoever.\n\nNamely, Buffett alluded that he thought changes to the U.S. tax code were on the horizon. Based on the current state of fiscal policy, Buffett put forth the notion that \"something has to give\" and that \"higher taxes are quite likely.\"\n\nSimply put, Buffett was looking to take some profits off the table and avoid a heftier tax liability on his capital gains should his prediction come true.\n\nWhile that same idea could be applied to his most recent sale of Apple stock, I think there are some other drivers influencing Buffett's calculations. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWall Street doesn't like uncertainty\n\nA lot has changed since Buffett made his prediction about the tax code three months ago. The first layer of the unknown that I'll unpack revolves around the dynamics of the upcoming presidential election.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to predictive analytics website Polymarket, Vice President and current presidential nominee for the Democratic Party Kamala Harris holds a slight lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nThe most recent model released by popular statistician and pollster Nate Silver suggests a similar line of thinking:\n\nToday's update. Harris is *still* gaining on Trump on our national polling average, now 3.1 points.https://t.co/vsGVG18HHIpic.twitter.com/rK9UtQr9fO\n\n-- Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) August 13, 2024\n\nWhile I'm not here to predict the winner of the presidency, I do feel comfortable saying that the race's outcome appears a bit too close to call at the moment.\n\nThe second layer of economic uncertainty that's prevalent right now is interest rates. Economists all across Wall Street have been forecasting rate cuts from the Federal Reserve since the beginning of the year. But as of now, Fed Chairman Powell and his constituents have yet to implement a tapering strategy.\n\nWhy I think Buffett wins no matter what\n\nTrying to identify the perfect moment to sell a stock is an exercise in false precision.\n\nHowever, the possibility of rate cuts combined with differentiating policy decisions put forth by presidential nominees make quite the financial enigma. Considering these decisions can influence any given industry, it's not entirely surprising to see \"smart money\" offload equities and hoard cash as these scenarios continue to play out.\n\nEven though Buffett may be leaving some potential gains on the table in Apple and Bank of America stock, the acclaimed investor isn't wasting his newfound capital.\n\nAccording to Berkshire's second-quarter filing, the firm held $237.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills on its balance sheet as of June 30. I see this as an extremely smart move by Buffett for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have returned roughly 14% so far in 2024. Considering that is almost double the long-run average return of the S&P 500 (when accounting for inflation) and includes a recent sell-off, I don't blame Buffett for taking some gains in a volatile technology stock like Apple and reallocating the cash to a safer, more predictable asset in Treasury Bills.\n\nSecond, replacing some dividend income from both Apple and Bank of America with something more steady, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, isn't a bad idea. While both companies have steadily raised their dividend over many years, it's entirely possible that an economic slowdown could result in a sudden cut or halt to these payments. So, in a way, I think that Buffett is hedging this possibility by rolling over T-Bills and collecting a nice substitute for a dividend.\n\nBAC Dividend data by YCharts\n\nNo matter what happens with the Fed, the election, the tax code, or the economy, Buffett has proven time and again that he knows how to make money in any situation. It'll be interesting to see if he makes any further adjustments following any Fed decisions or the election outcome.\n\nBut for now, I think the Oracle's decision to mitigate risk by holding onto cash and generating some passive income through Treasuries in lieu of new stocks will prove to be a wise one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Market Meltdown or Massive Opportunity? 7 Stocks to Watch",
        "content": "Every investor is well aware of the volatility sweeping the markets over the past few weeks. The same investors are trying to understand whether a market meltdown or massive opportunity is ahead. While no one knows with 100% accuracy there are several stocks investors should watch to get a better grasp of the future market direction.\n\nThese stocks represent certain narratives and overarching trends moving the markets. Certain classes and categories of stocks will perform better during this period of volatility. Investors can better position themselves by understanding those broad movements and their repercussions.\n\nWhether the current period is a market meltdown or a massive opportunity remains to be seen. As I write this the S&P 500 is up by nearly 2.5% on the day. It fell by nearly as much the day before.  Recession fears, employment data, Federal Reserve rate cut expectations and more are making the market exceptionally volatile. Current volatility is an extension of overall volatility that has increased in the modern era. With that said, let’s make sense of current volatility through the lens of seven stocks to watch.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA logo on phone and blurred AI chip on the background. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlan on continued volatility in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. The company –  arguably the world’s most important – is set to release earnings on August 28. In 2024 Nvidia’s shares have appreciated by as much as 185%. They’ve corrected over the last month, falling by nearly 20% as fears around artificial intelligence reach a fever pitch. Year-to-date gains now stand at approximately 110%.\n\nThe central theme of upcoming volatility over the next few weeks will be the release of Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chips. There’s a lot of controversy around that delay. When the news was released some analysts reacted negatively while others claimed Nvidia’s dominance made any delay a non-event. Days after the rumor began to spread, Nvidia flat-out denied any such issues.\n\nNvidia instead noted that sampling of the chips has begun and an H2 production ramp-up is on track. The conflicting claims set up a period of market intrigue over the next few weeks in the lead-up to earnings on August 28. Nvidia looks likely to continue to rebound given its claims about Blackwell production and the fact that many analysts are bullish should any delays occur.\n\nWolfspeed (WOLF) WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap stocks including Wolfspeed (NASDAQ:WOLF) deserve investor attention at the moment. The upcoming Fed pivot in September should catalyze small-cap stocks higher again as it did in July.\n\nStory continues\n\nWolfspeed is a small-cap firm that didn’t particularly benefit from the July rotation into small caps and away from large-cap tech. However, due to likely September rate cuts and its unique business, Wolfspeed is a stock to consider buying.\n\nWolfspeed is a leader in the high-tech growth industry. The company is a leader in the silicon carbide (SiC) market. SiC is a material with superior properties relative to the silicon commonly used throughout the semiconductor industry. Silicon carbide has higher thermal conductivity and can operate at higher voltages and temperatures than traditional silicon.\n\nThat has led many to believe that Wolf Speed is a massive emerging opportunity with a first-mover advantage through its leadership position in the material. Silicon carbide chips have applications in growth markets including EVs, 5G, IoT and more. While it’s easy to see Wolfspeed’s appeal given those facts, losses are growing at the firm. It’ll benefit greatly from cheaper lending soon so for bold investors Wolfspeed could be a huge opportunity.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Close-up of Coca Cola drink cans lying on paper background. KO stock\n\nSource: Tetiana Shumbasova / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Coca-Cola’s (NYSE:KO) stock has thrived over the last month as fears over a market meltdown increased. The company has become one of the most well-known defensive positions and a bastion of safety during market turbulence. The earnings machine seems to weather any storm long or short.\n\nThe most recent storm over the last month has seen KO shares rise by 9%. Despite the strong performance investors have reason to believe KO shares won’t rise much further.  I say that because a technical indicator, the relative strength index, indicates that KO shares are overbought at the moment. The so-called RSI Is considered to indicate overbought territory at a level of 70 or higher. Coca-Cola’s shares currently have an RSI above 97.\n\nThat’s a reasonable indication that the markets will soon move away from Coca-Cola or at least fewer will move into Coca-Cola. Although KO stock has a little bit of room to go until it reaches the consensus target price, suggesting upside, those who wait for prices to fall will benefit from higher dividend yields. The current RSI suggests that may be a better option.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going to continue to be one of the most interesting trades in the stock market as it commercializes AI. Shares have performed very well since the June 10  introduction of its AI, called Apple Intelligence. That was, up until the last few weeks as the broader AI play lost steam.\n\nWhile Apple was late to the game and its timing arguably unfortunate, there’s a lot to like about AAPL in the $210s. First of all, the consensus price for the stock is nearly $240 with some analysts believing it could reach $300.\n\nAll of that upside is predicated upon the successful launch of Apple Intelligence. Apple intelligence will require iOS 18 set to launch in September. However, Apple intelligence will not be available at the launch of iOS 18. Instead, it will be available with later updates of iOS 18.\n\nUsers will need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to access those AI features. Apple is likely to charge $20 for access to its most advanced AI features.\n\nThe point here for investors is that Apple is likely to receive a spike in revenues due to iPhone upgrades, Apple Intelligence subscriptions, and a boost to consumer spending as rate cuts are enacted.\n\nUFP Technologies (UFPT) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nUFP Technologies (NASDAQ:UFPT) is another small-cap stock to watch. As noted earlier in this article, there is an ongoing rotation into small-cap stocks. My colleague Joel Baglole noted that the rotation lost momentum since the beginning of August but that UFP Technologies Is one of the more interesting small-cap plays.\n\nThe stock is up nearly 650% over the past five years and more than 82% in 2024 alone. The company recently released earnings that once again bested expectations. Revenues and earnings per share both came in much better than expected.\n\nThe medical devices firm is very well positioned to grow rapidly. UFP Technologies has been on an acquisition spree of late Acquiring three companies in July ending with the July 16 acquisition of Marble Medical.\n\nThose acquisitions – combined with lower lending rates – could catalyze the company into another level of growth spiking prices in the process, making it one of the stocks to watch.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) A close-up shot of a hand on a screen with the Palantir (PLTR) logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) will continue to be one of the most interesting firms to watch as the following weeks in the stock market unfold.\n\nInvestors are already aware of how quickly Palantir has evolved into a profitable firm and one that is squarely entrenched in the enterprise AI opportunity. A lot has been said about that but the thrust of it is that Palantir continues to prove its doubters wrong.\n\nThe company has been profitable for over a year and continues to be. It is also quickly emerging as a commercially oriented AI firm providing an in-demand AI platform to the private sector. Beyond that, Palantir is a well-known public side firm with deep ties to the government. Those ties are getting stronger as the company just announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to bring AI to government agencies.\n\nThat sent Palantir stock surging higher by 10% during intraday trading. It’s highly likely that Palantir will continue to grow among stocks to watch given its strengthening ties in the public side and rapid growth commercially.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nInvestors should avoid Pinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) over the coming weeks and months. The reasoning for that assertion is relatively straightforward and is related to recent Q2 earnings results.\n\nResults themselves were actually strong with pinterests revenues coming in 1% higher than anticipated. However, the markets are always forward looking. Unfortunately, Pinterest projects Q3 growth in the range of 16 to 18%. Analysts were looking for 19% at the consensus level.\n\nSo, it’s clear that Pinterest will have a lot of work to do this quarter in trying to assuage fears of slowing growth. That is not the only issue confronting the firm nor is it the only reason to believe the stock will trade sideways or worse.\n\nPinterest shares are more expensive than all but 8% of the competition based on its P/E ratio. That P/E ratio is currently at the 10-year median level. However, Pinterest doesn’t look particularly strong at the moment so I see no reason to assume investors will want to buy it at these prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "At US$221, Is It Time To Put Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) On Your Watch List?",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a significant share price rise of 22% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Apple’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple Worth?\n\nAccording to our valuation model, Apple seems to be fairly priced at around 7.7% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $239.78, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Apple’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nWhat kind of growth will Apple generate? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AAPL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAPL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into Apple, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "title": "3 Defensive Stocks Worth Buying on the Dip in August",
        "content": "Defensive stocks are clearly on everyone’s mind after markets fell dramatically at the start of August. Investors worldwide moved into risk-off mode, fearing that the U.S. economy was about to hit a snag. The sudden increase in unemployment in July was the catalyst that left many worried.\n\nLast week’s improvement in jobless numbers has helped soothe nerves for now. However, markets are still trading lower than they were a week ago. This means it may be appropriate to consider which defensive stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nDefensive stocks offer particular advantages during expected market volatility, as they tend to be better at conserving value. For investors looking to cash in on the recent market drop, defensive stocks can offer an opportunity to generate a more stable return on investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) famed CEO Warren Buffet is one of the investors on a more defensive footing. Last week, Buffet caused headlines by disclosing that his company had sold half of its holding of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. The Oracle of Omaha didn’t explain why he divested his stake. Still, the shift from a relatively higher-risk tech stock to holding the largest cash haul in the company’s history suggests a defensive move.\n\nWhat stocks are worth buying, given the uncertainty around the August dip? Here are three defensive stocks to buy on the dip that could ride an improving market but potentially have a strong financial position to weather a period of slower growth.​\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven current market conditions, one place to look for clues on good defensive stocks to buy on the dip is to consider what Warren Buffett is investing in. Visa (NYSE:VISA) stands out among Buffett’s holdings as the largest credit card company in the world in terms of market capitalization.\n\nAs the leading digital payment solutions provider in nearly every country worldwide, Visa is well-positioned as a defensive play. While it does not offer credit, it charges transaction fees. An economic downturn may lead Americans to rely more on credit cards, potentially increasing Visa’s transaction volume.\n\nVisa has largely avoided volatility in broader markets, trading essentially flat year-to-date (YTD). This stability could relate to the company not offering growth seen in “cutting-edge” tech firms, having recently reported 9% profit growth over the last year.\n\nInterestingly, from a defensive perspective, Visa has $19.7 billion in cash and generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) last quarter to weather potential downturns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) is another defensive stock to buy on the dip. It has remained steady during recent market volatility. Its share price is higher than at the start of the month when the FOMC rate decision triggered broader market declines. Given its very loyal customer base in the tobacco industry, it makes logical sense to consider Altria a defensive play.\n\nWhile long-term interest in tobacco is waning, Altria has consistently generated solid income and offers an attractive dividend yield of 7.8%. This provides a convenient option during periods of market uncertainty. Additionally, Altria indicated in its most recent earnings report that it expects earnings growth weighted toward the second half of the year, anticipating earnings will increase 2.5-4.0% over the prior year.\n\nAnalysts generally agree with the prospects for growth in the latter half of 2022 and see Altria’s earnings continuing to expand next year. Analyst price targets for Altria stock have risen lately, setting an average of $19.5 per share, implying a potential upside of 14%.​\n\nWendy’s (WEN) A photo of a Wendy's chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.\n\nSource: Deutschlandreform / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany Americans turn to more affordable food sources like fast food as a stable defensive play during economic downturns. While McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is attempting to capture a higher-income customer with its McCafe coffee offerings, it is losing its reputation for cheap meals. This means that Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) affordable menu makes it a compelling defensive option.\n\nPrimarily located in the United States, Wendy’s is seeing stronger same-store sales growth internationally as it expands into new global markets. With a market capitalization of $3.48 billion, Wendy’s enterprise value is less than double that amount. From a risk-averse perspective, Wendy’s offers an attractive 5.8% forward dividend yield while boasting a return on equity (ROE) of 60.65%.\n\nWendy’s stock trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.5x, below the S&P 500 benchmark average of 27.9x. Analyst forecasts have become increasingly positive on WEN stock, citing a potential 14% upside to its average $19.5 per share price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock Market Sell-Off: The 2 Worst Mistakes Investors Can Make Right Now",
        "content": "The three major U.S. stock indexes have yielded positive returns year to date, but the market hit a rough patch in recent weeks. Recession fears resurfaced when weak jobs data raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates. The U.S. presidential election reset, and broader geopolitical tensions have heightened economic uncertainty.\n\nIn turn, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had its worst July in the past decade, and the index recently suffered its largest single-day decline in two years. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) plunged as investors rotated away from technology stocks, and the index entered correction territory when it closed more than 10% from its record high on Aug. 2.\n\nHere are the two worst mistakes investors can make right now.\n\nMistake 1: Avoiding stocks until the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rebound\n\nIt might seem prudent to wait patiently on the sidelines until the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rebound, but avoiding the stock market is one of the worst mistakes investors can make right now. Warren Buffett once told CNBC, \"The best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq has previously fallen into correction territory seven times in the last decade. But the index has generally rebounded quickly, so investors who avoid the stock market could easily miss the rebound rally. The chart below provides details.\n\nNasdaq's First Close in Correction Territory Nasdaq's Return Over the Next 12 Months Aug. 24, 2015 15% Oct. 24, 2018 15% June 3, 2019 32% Feb. 27, 2020 54% Sept. 8, 2020 41% March 8, 2021 2% Jan. 19, 2022 (24%) Average 19% Median 15%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAs shown above, during the last decade, the Nasdaq returned an average of 19% and a median of 15% during the 12-month periods following its first close in correction territory. We can apply that information to the current situation to make an educated guess about the future.\n\nSpecifically, the current market correction became official when the Nasdaq closed at 16,776 on Aug. 2, 2024. The index currently trades at 16,780, which implies upside of 19% (at the average) and 15% (at the median) through Aug. 2, 2025.\n\nSimilarly, the S&P 500 is currently 5% off its record high, and Goldman Sachs analysts see that as a buying opportunity, saying, \"We find that 5% pullbacks have historically been good entry points, as the index has gone on to provide a median 6% return over the subsequent three months with positive returns in 84% of episodes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns; the two indexes could drop further if the economy continues listing toward a recession. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to avoid the market right now. Even if the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fail to stage dramatic rebounds in the near term, history says both indexes are headed higher in the long run. In that context, the current drawdown is a buying opportunity for patient investors.\n\nMistake 2: Buying stocks on the dip without concern for valuation\n\nIndiscriminately purchasing stocks is one of the worst mistakes investors can make. Not every dip is a buying opportunity, and no stock is worth purchasing at any price. Warren Buffett once wrote, \"For the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.\"\n\nThat mistake is easy to make with popular stocks. For instance, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has declined 8% from its 52-week high, but shares trade at 33 times earnings. That valuation looks expensive because Wall Street anticipates earnings growth of 12% through 2026. Admittedly, the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence could spark a massive iPhone upgrade cycle, but I would avoid the stock until it trades at a more reasonable valuation.\n\nSimilarly, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) has declined 2% from its 52-week high, but shares trade at 90 times adjusted earnings. That valuation looks outrageously expensive because Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 21% annually through 2026.\n\nTo be fair, Palantir should benefit as businesses spend more on data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), and the company reported encouraging financial results in the most recent quarter. But I plan to keep this stock on my watch list until the price comes down.\n\nLastly, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has declined 13% from its 52-week high, but shares trade at 34.4 times earnings. That valuation looks pricey because Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 14% annually through 2026.\n\nMicrosoft has emerged as an early leader in generative AI, and it is ideally positioned to monetize the technology given its status as the world's largest software company. Even so, I would avoid Microsoft until shares are priced more reasonably.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s main manufacturing partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. said it expects revenue to grow in the current quarter and for the rest of year, after reporting a profit rise boosted by demand for servers powering AI applications.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes How Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\n\nThe iPhone producer, also known as Foxconn, said on Wednesday that net income in the June quarter was NT$35 billion ($1.1 billion), largely in line with analyst expectations. Hon Hai’s revenue for the period, released earlier, surpassed estimates and came in at NT$1.55 trillion, up 19%. This was helped in large part by its growing business of supplying data center operators with servers containing Nvidia Corp.’s AI accelerators.\n\nHon Hai has set itself the goal of securing 40% of the global AI server market, relying on its close relationships with many of the world’s biggest tech companies and depth of manufacturing expertise. The company’s shares are up close to 80% this year as investors have bought into the artificial intelligence pitch. Earlier this month, compatriot Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said its July revenue rose 45%, outpacing estimates for the quarter and suggesting that AI demand remained robust.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nGiven the global increase in AI applications, AI servers are likely to become Hon Hai’s key growth engine given its strong partnership with Nvidia. Its robust logistics and manufacturing capability could keep its iPhone assembly share above 50% even as Apple diversifies suppliers, but further ratings upgrade may be capped by low single-digit margins.\n\n— BI analyst Cecilia Chan\n\nShipments of the iPhone in China have in recent months reversed a slump from the start of the year, and the global smartphone market is accelerating its growth. Hon Hai, much like TSMC, benefits from any upsurge in consumer electronics demand, and the addition of AI features and enhancements is widely seen as a catalyst driving users to upgrade their devices.\n\nHon Hai’s July sales jumped 22% thanks to AI server sales, and the company’s Wednesday report indicated it expects growth across most of its business segments in the current quarter. The company expects strong growth from its cloud, networking and components groups, while smart electronics — iPhones included — are set to be roughly flat for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with outlook from Hon Hai’s statement)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Kamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): 5 Bullish Signs and 1 Red Flag",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) recently posted its Fiscal Q3 earnings, revealing a series of bullish indicators alongside a notable concern. In this article, we will explore five key bullish signs emerging from Apple’s latest results that highlight its growth potential and overall financial strength. At the same time, I will address one red flag that could negatively influence the stock’s investment case. For this particular reason, I remain neutral on AAPL stock despite its otherwise attractive characteristics.\n\nHighlight #1: Revenues Keep Reaching New Records\n\nThe first and most apparent highlight from Apple’s Fiscal Q3 report was that the company’s revenues hit a record $85.8 billion, marking a 5% increase compared to last year. Notably, this figure beat Wall Street’s expectations by a significant $1.85 billion, despite the company facing a 230 basis point headwind from foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nCEO Tim Cook highlighted that Apple achieved revenue records in over two dozen countries, including major markets like Canada, France, and India. Considering the prevalent sentiment that Apple’s growth has lagged lately, seeing decent single-digit growth and records across different geographies is certainly quite encouraging. Source: Apple’s FQ3 Report\n\nHighlight #2: Acceleration in Services Revenue Growth\n\nThe second highlight from Apple’s Q3 report is the acceleration in revenue growth from Services. Services revenue hit a record $24.2 billion, marking a 14% rise from the previous year and an acceleration from last year’s growth of 8%. The growth in Services helped drive this quarter’s revenue growth mentioned earlier, while reflecting strong performance across advertising, cloud, and payment services.\n\nNotably, the number of paid subscriptions skyrocketed to over one billion, with Apple more than doubling this figure from just four years ago. I believe the continued growth in Service revenues emphasizes the growing consumer reliance on Apple’s ecosystem of services, from Apple TV+ to Apple Music, among others.\n\nHighlight #3: Impressive Growth in iPad and Mac Segments\n\nAnother highlight revolving around Apple’s growth was tied to the iPad and Mac divisions, which showed notable growth during the quarter. iPad revenue surged 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models, which feature significant upgrades like the M4 chip and enhanced AI capabilities. Meanwhile, Mac revenue grew 2% to $7 billion, fueled by the success of the M3-powered MacBook Air.\n\nSure, demand for Apple’s devices tends to be cyclical. For example, iPad sales are likely to dip following this year’s strong surge. Still, Apple’s growth across these two divisions highlights its continued appeal in both personal and professional computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nHighlight #4: Customer Satisfaction and Device Install Base at All-Time Highs\n\nAnother bullish indicator highlighted by Apple’s management during the post-earnings call is the company’s outstanding customer satisfaction, as demonstrated by its record-breaking installed base of active devices. Management reported that its installed base reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments.\n\nNotably, customer satisfaction metrics for Apple products remained extremely high, with the iPhone 15, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch all receiving top ratings. For example, iPhone 15 satisfaction was reported at 98% in the U.S., while customer satisfaction for iPad and Apple Watch stood at 97%.\n\nWhile these numbers don’t directly reflect Apple’s underlying financials, they suggest that demand and sales volumes regarding future device releases should remain robust. Evidently, Apple expects very strong sales for the upcoming release of iPhone 16.\n\nHighlight #5: Financial Strength and Shareholder Returns\n\nLast but not least, Apple’s Fiscal Q3 report reminded us of its remarkable financial strength, which enables it to sustain superb shareholder returns. The company ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities, with its net cash standing at $52 billion. Apple continued to buy back shares at a rapid pace, which was in line with management’s long-term goal of reaching a neutral net cash position.\n\nThe company repurchased $69.9 billion worth of stock during the first nine months of this fiscal year, up from $56.5 billion last year. The company is currently on track to repurchase $100 billion worth of stock for the year. While at Apple’s current humongous market cap, even such a large amount translates to a thin buyback yield of just 3%, it is still likely to support the stock’s upward momentum.\n\nApple’s One Red Flag – Its Valuation\n\nDespite Apple celebrating several positive developments in its Fiscal Q3 results, its report exposed the one red flag that investors should be wary of — its valuation. The company continued to post notable revenue growth, while earnings per share also grew by a remarkable 10.2% to $1.70. Yet, it’s hard to justify the forward P/E ratio of 32.3x based on this year’s consensus EPS estimate of $6.71 and Apple’s current stock price.\n\nWall Street is confident that Apple can maintain double-digit EPS growth over the medium term, with the upcoming iPhone 16 potentially serving as a major catalyst. This release could mark the beginning of a new era for Apple as it introduces truly AI-powered smartphones. I’ve explored this topic in more depth in another article, which I encourage you to check out if you’re interested.\n\nHowever, even with Wall Street’s optimistic projections, Apple stock is currently trading at a hefty forward P/E ratio of 20.6x its expected 2027 EPS. In my view, this high multiple could limit Apple’s upside potential in the future, thus hindering its investment case.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nDespite the stock’s hefty valuation, Wall Street remains relatively bullish on Apple. Specifically, AAPL stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $248.78, the average AAPL stock price target implies 12.4% upside potential.\n\nSee more AAPL analyst ratings\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell AAPL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Krish Sanka of TD Cowen, with an average return of 42.3% per rating and a 91% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nApple’s Q3 results showed developments and growth across the board, including solid revenue growth, particularly in Services, and an ever-expanding device install base. However, despite these positives, the stock’s high valuation poses a concern. While Apple’s financial strength and robust product demand are clear, its forward P/E ratio suggests that future upside may be limited. As a result, I remain neutral on Apple stock, acknowledging its strengths but cautious of its potential for overvaluation.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google rolls out Pixel 9 phones earlier than usual as AI race with Apple heats up",
        "content": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google on Tuesday unveiled its next generation of Pixel phones, providing the maker of Android software a head start on the next iPhone in the race to bring more artificial-intelligence services to devices that have become people’s constant companions.\n\nThe showcase held near Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters took place two months earlier than when the company typically rolls out the next models in its Pixel phone line-up, which made its debut eight years ago.\n\nAlthough Pixel phones still represent a sliver of worldwide smartphone sales, they are still closely watched because they serve as Google’s platform for demonstrating the latest advances in the Android operating system that powers virtually every phone not made by Apple.\n\nAnd Google left little doubt that the Pixel 9 phones are meant to be a vessel for the AI technology that is expected to reshape the way people live and work, just as smartphones in general have done over the past 15 years.\n\n“We are obsessed with the idea that AI can make life easier and more productive for people,” Rick Osterloh, a Google senior vice president who oversees the Pixel phones, said Tuesday.\n\nThat's similar to the theme Apple is accentuating as it prepares to make AI a centerpiece of the iPhone.\n\nThat moment is expect to arrive shortly after Labor Day when Apple traditionally takes the wraps off its next iPhone. The next model, the iPhone 16, is expected to be a big attraction because it will be equipped with the special chip needed to run a suite of AI features. Those features are designed to make Apple's virtual assistant Siri smarter and perform a wide variety of other tasks that the company is promising will bring more joy to people's lives, while still protecting their privacy.\n\nBut Apple's plans for AI remain hazier than Google's vision, and Google is also rolling it out more broadly, including on Samsung phones powered by Android, said Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon. That may increase the pressure on Apple next month when it unveils the next iPhone.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Pixel 9 lineup is also packed with AI technology, a shift that the Google began last October when it released that year’s model. This generation of phones will be the first centered around the Gemini technology that’s become the focal point of its push into AI.\n\nJust as Apple is aiming to do with Siri, Google has designed its Gemini assistant to be more conversational, providing it with a range of 10 different human-like voices. It's able to handle even more tasks, especially if users are willing to give it access to email and other documents.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn another move mirroring Apple, Google is equipping the Pixel 9 lineup with a special chip enabling many AI-powered services to be handled on the device instead of remote data centers, with the aim of boosting personal privacy and security.\n\nIn on-stage demonstrations Tuesday, the Gemini assistant speaking in a voice called “Ursa” was able to come up with helpful ideas for a fun way to use invisible ink when asked to come up with creative ideas.\n\nBut the Gemini assistant also stumbled when shown a picture of a poster for singer Sabrina Carpenter, and when asked to let the questioner know when she was performing a concert in the area. After coming up blank on the first two requests, the Gemini assistant provided the requested information.\n\nThe Pixel 9 phones also will feature “Magic Editor,” AI technology capable of completely transforming pictures by quickly and seamlessly adding a person who wasn’t in the original photo, or by altering the photo's landscape or background.\n\nThe more advanced Gemini Assistant will require a $20 monthly subscription that will be free for one year for all buyers of the next Pixel 9 phones, which will begin shipping Aug. 22 before becoming more widely available next month. The $240 benefit that Google is offering with a free one-year subscription to its Gemini Advanced service makes it more likely Apple won't be able to charge for its suite of AI services, Emarketer's Harmon said.\n\nThe standard Pixel 9 will sell for $800, a $100 increase from last year, while the Pixel 9 Pro will sell for $1,000 or $1,100, depending on the size. The next generation of a foldable Pixel phone that Google introduced last year will sell for $1,800.\n\nThe event also signaled that Google intends to conduct business as usual even as its internet empire is being threatened by a judge’s recent decision declaring its dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly.\n\nThe landmark ruling will trigger another round of court hearings to determine the measures that Google must take to create a more competitive market – a process that could result in Google being banned from engaging in some deals or, in the drastic scenario, being ordered to spin off its Android software or relinquish other key pillars bolstering the nearly $2 trillion market value of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.\n\nBesides its latest phones, Google also took aim at several other popular Apple products with its next Pixel Watch and wireless earbuds.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Paramount Global (PARA) announced in a memo to staff Tuesday that it will shut down its storied TV studio by the end of the week — the latest move in a series of aggressive cost cuts the company is taking ahead of its expected merger with Skydance Media.\n\n\"Paramount Global has made the difficult decision to close Paramount Television Studios as part of the company's broader restructuring plans,\" Paramount TV Studios president Nicole Clemens wrote. \"This has been a challenging and transformative time for the entire industry, and sadly, our studio is not immune.\"\n\nParamount's TV studio has produced top series like Netflix's \"Thirteen Reasons Why,\" Amazon's (AMZN) \"Reacher\" and Apple's (AAPL) \"Defending Jacob.\" The stock traded flat on the heels of the news.\n\nClemens will be exiting the company as a result of the shutdown. All current series and development projects will transition to CBS Studios, the company said.\n\n\"To be clear, this is not a decision based on how PTVS performed,\" Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks wrote in a follow-up memo to staff. \"This move is the result of significant changes in the TV and streaming marketplace and the need to streamline our company.\"\n\nLast week, Paramount reported a sharper slowdown than analysts expected in its linear TV business as the company took a nearly $6 billion write-down on the value of its cable unit. At the same time, the media giant announced plans to lay off 15% of its US workforce after eliminating about 800 positions in February.\n\nAccording to a separate internal memo from the company's CEO trio, the layoffs kicked off on Tuesday and will continue in three phases through the end of the year.\n\n\"We expect 90% of these actions to be complete by the end of September,\" Paramount co-CEOs George Cheeks, Brian Robbins, and Chris McCarthy wrote to staff.\n\nThe developments come as the entertainment giant preps its balance sheet for an eventual Skydance takeover, set to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSkydance, which will be valued at $4.75 billion following the all-stock deal's completion, said it would inject $6 billion in cash into Paramount, with $1.5 billion going directly into its debt-ridden balance sheet.\n\nSkydance CEO David Ellison will become chairman and CEO of the combined company, while former NBCUniversal executive Jeff Shell, who was ousted last year over what NBC parent Comcast (CMCSA) deemed an \"inappropriate relationship\" with a female employee, will serve as president.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month, the new leadership team laid out their strategic vision for Paramount. This includes $2 billion in cost cuts with $500 million already underway. The latest round of layoffs and restructuring announcements highlighted these efforts.

        "title": "Google Launches Pixel 9 Phones, Pixel Watch 3 in Renewed Push to Sell AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google is rolling out upgraded smartphones, watches and earbuds, aiming to take on Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. and offer more ways to use artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test How Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space Johannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\n\nGoogle is touting the products — unveiled weeks ahead of Apple’s newest gadgets — as the best way to experience its latest AI technology. The hardware also has outward changes, with Google moving away from the curved design it has used for several years on its Pixel phones.\n\nDominant in internet search but long an underdog in tech devices, Google has been working to more tightly integrate its hardware and software. After putting devices chief Rick Osterloh in charge of Google’s Android platform earlier this year, the company is betting that this more unified approach can turn its hardware business into an engine for AI growth.\n\nThe new devices include the Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL phones, as well as an upscale folding model called the 9 Pro Fold. Google also unveiled a Pixel Watch 3 in two sizes and the Pixel Buds Pro 2.\n\nThe phones will feature an upgraded version of Google Assistant with the company’s Gemini generative AI, making it capable of more sophisticated responses, such as providing a cooking recipe after seeing a photo of ingredients. The company is offering a choice of sizes with its high-end Pro model, including a 6.3-inch version, a 6.8-inch edition and a foldable option with an 8-inch inner display.\n\nThe standard Pixel 9 starts at $799 and will go on sale Aug. 22. The $999 and $1,099 Pro versions include better cameras and higher-end materials. The company said that its Pixel 9 phones are twice as durable as the models they are replacing. The foldable edition also sports a new design, adopting a more square shape when open. It starts at $1,799 and reaches stores on Sept. 4.\n\nThe new Pixel Watch line includes an XL option, measuring 45 millimeters across, and improved displays that provide a larger active area and can be twice as bright as prior models. Google promises 24 hours of battery life with the always-on display, and the watch will let users interact with delivery people via the company’s Nest Doorbell. The device can be used to control a connected Google TV set as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe watch starts at $349 and ranges up to $499 for the larger size with built-in cellular connectivity. It goes on sale Sept. 10.\n\nGoogle acquired Fitbit in 2021 and has been integrating the fitness company’s technology into its products. As part of the announcements Tuesday, Google is offering a selection of Peloton Interactive Inc. classes to users who subscribe to the premium version of Fitbit’s service.\n\nThe Pixel Buds are now 27% smaller and 24% lighter, Google said. The $229 earbuds include a new A1 chip for audio processing and will get as much as eight hours of battery life on one charge in noise-canceling mode.\n\nThe announcements come at an unusual time, as Google has typically updated its flagship Pixel devices in October. This year’s move jumps the company ahead of Apple’s September debut of its iPhone 16 line. Apple is also planning an update to its watches and AirPods. Samsung, meanwhile, recently rolled out the Galaxy Watch Ultra alongside new, pricier Galaxy Fold and Flip models.\n\nGoogle has shown recent signs of progress after years of struggling to compete with Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands. Pixel holds 4.6% of the US market, according to research firm IDC, up from 3.6% in 2022. But Apple controls more than 50% of the market in the US.\n\nIn May, Google rolled out a lower-end Pixel 8a phone and cut the price of its tablet, aiming to make further inroads.\n\nHere’s what’s new for each device model:\n\nPixel 9\n\nA 50-megapixel wide-angle camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide camera sensor (an increase from 12 megapixels on the Pixel 8) on the back. Autofocus for the front camera. A 35% brighter screen. 12 gigabytes of memory, up from 8 on the Pixel 8. 20% longer battery life, including a new 100-hour ultra-low-power mode.\n\nPixel 9 Pro and Pro XL\n\nA 50-megapixel wide-angle camera, 48-megapixel 5X telephoto camera and 48-megapixel ultrawide camera sensors. A 42-megapixel front camera, up from 12 on the Pixel 8 Pro, with a wider field of view and better light sensitivity. The displays have 15% thinner borders than the prior Pro model. 16 gigabytes of memory, up from 12 on the Pixel 8 Pro. Charges as much as 70% of its battery in half an hour.\n\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nBoth screens are larger, with the exterior display moving to 6.3 inches from 5.8 inches and the unfolded screen going to 8 inches from 7.6 inches. The interior screen is also 80% brighter. Google says the device is lighter than its predecessor and has the largest unfolded screen of any foldable phone. Similar cameras to the prior model, including a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide sensor and a 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera.\n\nThe new Pixel phones each have a new Tensor G4 chip, designed in-house, that Google says is about 20% faster at launching apps and loading webpages. The phones add new software features, including a weather app with AI-based summaries, enhancements for making calls sound clearer, and an app for sorting through screenshots and parsing out key information.\n\nGoogle also outlined new camera features:\n\nIts new Add Me feature allows a photographer to insert themselves into a shot by taking another photo in the same location and blending the two using augmented reality and AI. The Magic Editor adds an Autoframe tool that uses AI to recompose an image and people’s positions in it. The Reimagine feature can change the background of an image based on a text prompt. A new Video Boost option uses AI to upgrade video into what Google calls 8K-like quality.\n\nGoogle is also adding a few enhancements that Apple has rolled out in recent years, including a satellite-based communication service for off-the-grid emergencies, an AI-based image-creation app, and a tool for recording phone calls and providing a summary of the conversation. And Google is offering access to its Gemini Nano AI models for free to buyers of its new phones.\n\n(Updates with Peloton in ninth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity New Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas) Kamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?

        "content": "By Kenrick Cai and Max A. Cherney\n\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, California - Alphabet's Google on Tuesday unveiled a lineup of new Pixel smartphones with deeper integrations of its artificial intelligence technology as it races to incorporate AI into its hardware.\n\nThe upgrades include a Pixel-only feature that lets users search for information stored in screenshots. Android users can also now pull up Gemini, Google’s chatbot, as an overlay on top of another app to answer questions or generate content.\n\n\"There have been so many promises, so many coming-soons, and not enough real-world helpfulness when it comes to AI, which is why today we're getting real,\" said Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of devices and services.\n\n\"We're fully in the Gemini era,\" he told engineers, executives, analysts and media attending the bigger-than-usual event at Alphabet's Bay View campus in Mountain View, California.\n\nThe event bucked another tradition: the latest versions of its Pixel smartphones were announced in the summer rather than in autumn as Google had done with every iteration of the device since its launch in 2016.\n\n\"I've been to a lot of Google events and not only was this one of the most elaborate, but it was one of the most complete,\" said Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponential. He said Google demonstrated that it was at the forefront of AI.\n\nThe earlier timing of the event is Google’s latest bid to keep up with rivals in injecting AI features into its consumer-facing products and comes ahead of Apple's planned launch of a new iPhone in September.\n\nIn June, Apple announced that devices including its latest version of iPhones would get upgrades that include “Apple Intelligence,” a slew of generative AI-powered features within native applications, and an integration with ChatGPT, the chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nGoogle employees showcased several live demos of new Gemini functions, such as a voice conversation feature, though an attempt to use Gemini to cross-reference a picture of a concert poster with the calendar app took three tries and two devices to run successfully.\n\nPixel 9, the base 6.3-inch display model, will retail at a starting price of $799, which is $100 more than the previous model. This and the 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL will begin shipping later in August, a company spokesperson said. The Pixel 9 Pro, which comes with added features like a better camera, and the foldable Pixel 9 Pro Fold will ship in September.\n\nThe new gadgets are available to preorder on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\n'MANAGE MY LIFE BETTER'\n\n\"The two things that (consumers are) looking at AI to do right now is organization — and that's across communications, across calendaring, basically manage my life better than I can — and then the other thing is content creation,\" said IDC analyst Linn Huang. \"I think Google nailed both.\"\n\nGoogle holds less than 1% market share in global smartphone shipments as of the second quarter of 2024, according to IDC. It trails far behind Samsung’s market share of 18.9% and Apple's market share of 15.8%, in part because Google has entered fewer markets and is focused on higher-end price segments.\n\nIn the United States, Google's 4.5% share makes it the fourth-biggest smartphone maker.\n\nThe Pixel line has also enabled Google to show off advances and spur the developer ecosystem around its Android operating system, which is used by device manufacturers like Samsung. Android, globally, is installed on more than 80% of smartphones.\n\nAndroid represents one of several frontlines where Google is battling competitors to embed AI in ways that consumers will use. In May, it debuted a swath of upgrades to core products like its search engine.\n\nThe company's engineers redesigned the Pixel's exterior and included camera upgrades as well as Google's new Tensor G4 chip.\n\nGoogle announced new versions of its smartwatch, the Pixel Watch 3, and Pixel Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds on Tuesday as well.\n\nGoogle also added a “Loss of Pulse” feature to the new Pixel Watch. The feature uses algorithms to determine whether a user’s heart has stopped and can contact emergency services. The feature will be available in the United Kingdom and the European Union.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Google and Peloton, the fitness company known for its stationary bike, announced a content partnership in which subscribers to Google's Fitbit Premium service would gain access to a library of Peloton's training classes.\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai and Max A.

        "content": "Google has unveiled its new range of flagship Pixel smartphones, which the company says have been built to house its most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tech, as it looks to take on Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe new range includes the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL, and a new foldable in the form of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which were announced alongside a new smartwatch and wireless ear buds.\n\nThe new phones have been loaded with AI – including Google’s Gemini chatbot, an AI image generation app, camera editing tools and voice call transcripts – and are powered by the tech giant’s own Tensor G4 chip.\n\nGoogle said the chip was designed with DeepMind – the advanced AI arm of the tech giant – and this means it can run Google’s most advanced AI models on the devices to help users with tasks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis includes with Gemini Live, a new version of the chatbot which is meant to be the phone’s virtual assistant and can be prompted at any time with queries, commands or questions. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second foldable smartphone (Google/PA)\n\nThe photo editing tools include a feature called Add Me, which enables users to add the designated photographer to group photos simply by taking a second photo with them in it, with AI then combining the two.\n\nThe suite of AI tools also includes a new tool called Pixel Screenshots, which uses AI to search a user’s screenshots to find the key piece of information that was previously captured, without having to scroll back through the entire camera roll.\n\nThe company confirmed the Pixel 9 will start at £799, the Pixel 9 Pro at £999 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL at £1,099, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will start at £1,749.\n\nIn a blog post discussing the launch of the new phones, Google said: “We’re infusing AI into everything we do, across every layer of our full tech stack — from data centre infrastructure to the operating system to devices.\n\n“In order for AI to be truly helpful, it should naturally fit into our everyday lives, and the best place to experience that is on your Android device.\n\nStory continues\n\n“With Gemini deeply integrated into Android, we’re rebuilding the operating system with AI at the core, and redefining what phones can do.”\n\nGoogle is far from the only smartphone maker going to great lengths to load its latest devices with AI features – Samsung has launched its Galaxy AI features across its 2024 range of smartphones, and Apple previewed a range of tools it calls Apple Intelligence earlier in the summer.\n\nThe three tech giants are among the big names in the sector looking to establish themselves as the market leader when it comes to AI, with their popular smartphone brands being the key outlet for new features and services.\n\nIndustry expert Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said Google’s heavy focus on AI for this launch, and the timing of the event itself – two months earlier than usual – showed the company was keen to get ahead of its rivals.\n\n“It is no surprise Google focused heavily on new AI capabilities given their strategic importance to the company,” he said.\n\n“We expect the ‘Add Me’ group photography feature to be an anchor experience in the Pixel 9’s promotion. This and the slew of other AI-powered experiences are critical to the overall competitiveness of Android smartphones, particularly as Apple Intelligence looms.\n\n“The timing of this event came as a surprise. Google likely felt that with the recent unveiling of Apple Intelligence, Apple’s iPhone launch next month will focus on why it has ‘the best phone for AI’.\n\n“Google’s earlier launch potentially allows it to announce features first and claim leadership in use case development and deployment in this highly strategic area.”",

        "title": "Google debuts Pixel smartphone lineup, including a new foldable phone, ahead of Apple's latest iPhone push",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its latest lineup of Pixel phones, including a slick, new foldable, during its Made by Google event at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., on Tuesday.\n\nThe lineup features the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and comes roughly a month before Apple (AAPL) is set to unveil its iPhone 16 line. That gives Google a decent jump on its rival tech giant.\n\nAll of the Pixel 9 phones come loaded with Google’s Android 14 operating system and the company’s AI-powered Gemini platform. And while the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pros offer more upscale designs, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was easily the main attraction.\n\nPixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nGoogle’s second-generation foldable, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold — yes, it’s a mouthful — features a thinner and lighter design so it feels less bulky than its predecessor.\n\nThe 9 Pro Fold, like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 6, sports a front screen and a foldable internal display. This time around, though, Google has increased the size of the Fold’s front screen from 5.8 inches to 6.3 inches, making it feel like you're using a regular smartphone when it's folded up. Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a new design, along with an improved front screen and better rear cameras. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\nInside, the Fold gets a larger 8-inch foldable panel, up from 7.6 inches. Google is also using its Super Actua display technology on the internal screen, giving it more vivid colors.\n\nThe Pixel Fold also gets three new rear cameras: a wide-angle lens, an ultra-wide angle, and a telephoto option with up to 5x optical zoom. Inside, the Fold packs Google’s new Tensor G4 chip and 16GB of RAM. You can choose between 256GB and 512GB of storage.\n\nOn the software side, the Pixel Fold allows users to run two apps side-by-side in split-screen mode when using the internal display. The Pixel Fold is priced at $1,799, which is the same price as the first-generation Fold, but still well into the premium smartphone range.\n\nPixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pros\n\nIn addition to the Fold, Google showed off its Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Think of the Pixel 9 as the mainstream entry in the lineup and the two Pro phones as Google’s high-end offerings.\n\nOutside of their display sizes, there’s no real difference between the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google says the Pixel 9 Pro gets a 6.3-inch Super Actua screen while the 9 Pro XL gets a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. The Pixel 9 comes with a 6.3-inch Actua panel. Google's Pixel 9 Pro XL gets a sleek new look and power AI features powered by the company's Gemini assistant. (Google) (Google)\n\nAll three phones have slimmer designs with smaller display bezels and new, more dramatic-looking rear camera bumps. The Pixel 9 gets a glossy rear panel, while the 9 Pros get a matte finish with polished metal edging. All of that is to say these are great-looking devices, which makes it a shame that you’ll probably cover them with cases.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pros each come with Google’s Tensor G4 chip. The Pixel 9 gets 12GB of RAM, with options for 128GB and 256GB of storage. The Pixel 9 Pros get 16GB of RAM and options for 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage.\n\nOn the camera front, the Pixel 9 comes with an ultra-wide lens and wide-angle lens, while the Pros get triple-lens setups.\n\nThe Pixel 9 starts at $799, while the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL start at $999 and $1,099, respectively.\n\nGoogle Gemini\n\nEach Pixel phone will come loaded with Google’s generative AI-powered Gemini software. Available by long-pressing the power button on the side of the phone, Gemini can pull up information from the web and, in the future, plug into the company’s various apps, including Gmail and Calendar.\n\nGoogle is also adding two new AI-powered features to its phones: Pixel Screenshots and Add Me. Pixel Screenshots is an easy-to-use repository for the screenshots you take on your phone that uses AI to pull important information from them. So, if you screenshot an invitation to a party, Screenshots will grab the date, time, and location and give you the option to create a calendar event.\n\nAnd if you need to look for a specific screenshot, you can use the built-in search function. So, if you’ve been taking screenshots of different pairs of sneakers you want and need to find them, you can search for sneakers, and the app will pull up any relevant screenshots. This could also be helpful if you’ve been on a work trip and need to take screenshots of your purchases.\n\nAdd Me, meanwhile, is a photo feature designed for those instances when you want to take a group photo, but don’t have a tripod or anyone around to take the shot. It does this by allowing you to take a photo of your friends, then having them step out of the shot and you step in. Add Me then puts the two photos together into a single shot, making it appear as though you took a normal group photo. I got to try Add Me in person, and it worked rather well.\n\nOverall, Google has a solid-looking lineup of new devices coming just ahead of the launch of Apple’s latest iPhones. And while Google’s phones won’t reach the kind of sales volumes as Apple’s — Google would have to steal market share from its partner Samsung to get that far — it will be interesting to see how they all match up.

        "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: August 2024",
        "content": "Before considering which semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip, it’s important to understand why chip stocks have been falling since the beginning of July. Consider three intertwined reasons.\n\nFirst, recession concerns are back. The latest job numbers show a tightening labor market, and the July reading on inflation is due the week of August 12. Global markets are starting to believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t be able to cut interest rates quickly enough to prevent a recession.\n\nGeopolitical concerns are also bedeviling investors. The outcome of this November’s election is likely to have significant ramifications in the ways the U.S. relates to China and/or Taiwan. That could put additional pressure on inventory levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis means investors are starting to sell some winners either to build up cash or to rotate into other stocks. Because of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, chip stocks have been some of the biggest winners in 2024.\n\nBut when does a sell-off become overdone? Every investor must answer that for themselves. But for a variety of reasons, the following three companies look like attractive semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) In this photo The logo of Nvidia AI displayed on smartphone screen. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Muhammad Alimaki / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 111% in 2024. It’s also down 22% in the 30 days ending August 9, 2024. That the first statement is true, doesn’t make the second statement less true. Shares of NVIDIA have pulled back substantially, but is that reason to buy semiconductor stocks on the dip?\n\nThose in the No camp would point out that NVIDIA has announced a delay in chip production. It also may be discontinuing its popular and inexpensive GeForce RTX 3060 chip. The belief is that any production delay opens the door for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) that are eager to capture market share. Many companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are actively looking for alternatives to NVIDIA chips.\n\nBut that presumes that the competition is ready with chips to take that share. It also speculates the economy remaining strong enough so that what corporations have noted as intention to spend on AI infrastructure matches what they actually spend.\n\nWhile that may affect NVIDIA as much as other companies, the company and NVDA stock are well positioned to overcome any short-term impacts.\n\nARM Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe one-year anniversary of ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) going public is approaching. And it’s been quite a year. Shares are up 55% since the initial public offering (IPO) but are down more than 32% in the last month. A solid first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings report may have put a floor on the sell-off. But it’s not lifting ARM stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo understand what could be driving this, it’s important to comprehend ARM’s role in chip manufacturing. Specifically, the company doesn’t make or produce its own chips. Rather, it’s a designer for chips and software which collects licensing fees and royalties on its architectures and intellectual properties (IPs).\n\nIn the company’s recent earnings report, it offered cautious guidance. That is, it maintained its current guidance. As noted in the introduction, that’s not what investors want to hear right now, particularly if they’re going to pay a premium for chip stocks. This could be the reason for short interest in ARM stock is up in the last 30 days.\n\nOn the other hand, about 99% of premium smartphones are powered by ARM CPUs. That should put a floor on the company’s fundamentals which makes this a buyable dip.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there’s such a thing as an undervalued chip stock in 2024, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) may be it. AMAT stock is up only 37% in the last 12 months, which seems downright undervalued compared to other chip stocks. However, the stock is down more than 20% in the last month. That may signal one of the best opportunities for semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nLike ARM, Applied Materials doesn’t make chips, but it provides chipmakers with innovative materials and engineering solutions. In May 2023, Applied Materials announced its intention to build its Equipment and Process Innovation and Commercialization (EPIC) center. The company touts this as “the world’s largest and most advanced facility for collaborative semiconductor process technology and manufacturing equipment research and development (R&D).”\n\nThe project won’t be ready until 2026. However, the company reports earnings in mid-August. A strong report should be just what the company needs to move it higher, particularly since AMAT stock appears to have found support around $193.09 at market close on August 12, 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "INTC Stock Prediction: Can Intel Survive?",
        "content": "As a tech reporter going back over 40 years, it’s incredible to be writing this.\n\nBut can Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) survive?\n\nWhat was once the world’s dominant semiconductor power is a shell of its former self. It’s all there in the second quarter earnings report, which led it to lose 43% of its value in just one month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe loss of $1.6 billion, 38 cents per share, is just the headline. Now nearly 20,000 employees are heading for the exits. The dividend has also been suspended. Shareholders are suing, claiming they weren’t told how bad the trouble was.\n\nThe Trouble Is Bad\n\nPat Gelsinger returned to the company where he’d first made his career as CEO in 2021, determined to remake Intel as a first-class chip foundry, not just a design house.\n\nIt’s not working. The Foundry isn’t cost-competitive with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Yields are bad. Chips that were due to arrive in 2025 may not arrive until 2027.\n\nThe design house is worse. PC processor chips are failing. Its Gaudi Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), meant to compete with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), doesn’t. That chip isn’t even made by Intel but by TSMC.\n\nMy saying “I told you so” over 20 years doesn’t help anything. Intel blew its opportunities in phone chips, modems and memory under a succession of marketing and finance leaders. Gelsinger was chief technology officer (CTO) before his 2009 departure to VMware, but 12 years is a lifetime in tech terms.\n\nGelsinger’s foundry failures have a political dimension. Intel got $8.5 billion in U.S. government money for building its new foundries in Arizona and Ohio. There is also an Investment Tax Credit of up to 25% on its $100 billion of investment, and it’s eligible for $11 billion in government loans. The failures of Intel Foundry are on us and could kill the whole U.S. move into manufacturing if Republicans resume control of Washington.\n\nHelp!\n\nNvidia is just one of the companies desperate for Intel to succeed. It can’t get all the supplies it needs from TSMC. Intel is now in a race with Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), which already supplies Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to deliver them.\n\nIntel’s efforts are kept afloat by borrowing. Long-term debt was over $48 billion at the end of June. There’s also $4.7 billion in short-term debt. Intel had nearly $15 billion in new financing during the second quarter while putting $11.6 billion into capital spending. The Intel Foundry lost $2.8 billion during the quarter. Intel has also tapped private equity, which owns almost half the profits from new foundries.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you think Nvidia or a Cloud leader like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might be sniffing for a bargain, forget it. The “enterprise value” of Intel includes its debt. The price of buying this mess isn’t $84 billion. It probably starts at $150 billion. Then you will have to run it and take losses already built in.\n\nThe problem is what I call “Moore’s Second Law.” It’s true that chip densities, speeds and thus cost-efficiency double as circuit lines grow closer. But the cost of setting up production also doubles along with this efficiency. The industry is losing the ability to produce what it can design. Maybe that’s the real end of Moore’s Law.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvestors sitting on losses may be tempted to throw in more cash. At a minimum, you will reduce your cost basis in the stock.\n\nBut there are no guarantees. Even with $10 billion in cost cuts, Gelsinger isn’t promising profits before 2026. Even if Intel does show a profit, the AI ramp-up may be over before it gets into gear.\n\nIntel is too essential to fail. What Gelsinger calls Intel’s “death march” is taking longer than anyone anticipated, and the U.S. needs it to get the foundry right.\n\nYou’re paying for this with your tax dollars. But you may want to think twice before adding new investment dollars to the pot.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a LONG position in INTC, TSM, AAPL, and MSFT.

        "title": "Apple Inc (AAPL): A Detailed Analysis of Its Market Position and Growth Potential in the Computer Hardware Sector",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) against the other computer hardware stocks.\n\nAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the computer hardware market is projected to grow from $674.44 billion in 2023 to $710.32 billion in 2024, with a 5.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), mainly driven by personal computing, global supply chains, internet expansion, and more data centers.\n\nBy 2028, the market is expected to reach $914.55 billion at a 6.5% CAGR, fueled by trends like remote work infrastructure, sustainable practices, smart city development, and digital transformation. Key trends include edge computing, AI integration, modular systems, biometric security, and hybrid cloud environments, with significant investments in smart city projects, particularly in China.\n\nThe most important trends in the advancement of computer hardware are AI and machine learning which are revolutionizing hardware design and enabling applications like autonomous vehicles and robotics. Apart from that, the Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding, connecting more devices in smart homes, cities, and industries. It has led to a focus on improving security, efficiency, and the ability of different IoT devices, systems, and technologies to work together seamlessly.\n\nRole of AI in the Growth of the Computer Hardware Industry\n\nOn May 28, Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ and said that we’re still in a phase of AI development where hardware is crucial. Companies like NVIDIA are thriving because their products are essential for running large AI models, which require immense computational power. He said that this situation is similar to how search engines, like Google or Bing, have long relied on substantial investments in hardware to function effectively.\n\nFertik added that as AI technology evolves, there will be a shift. The costs associated with AI hardware will decrease, and smaller, more specialized AI models will emerge, which will be tailored for specific industries or purposes.\n\nWhen this happens, the focus and financial gains will also move toward software and computer science (software testing and development) companies. However, they will not significantly move from computer hardware companies and they will still benefit from the growing AI industry.\n\nIndustry Has Room for Growth Beyond AI\n\nA major growth prospect for computer hardware is quantum computing, an industry that is expected to reach $11.4 billion by 2027 from $2.74 billion in 2022, according to Research and Markets. Quantum Computing offers significant benefits by improving the speed and efficiency of complex computations.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike classical computers, which process bits as 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits that can represent multiple states at once, which enables them to solve problems much faster. This is especially valuable in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and optimization as it solves complex simulations and calculations that are currently infeasible for classical computers.\n\nQuantum Computing can significantly benefit the computer hardware industry by driving advancements in technology and creating new markets. Similar to AI, the development of quantum hardware requires innovations in materials science, cooling systems, and chip design, which can push the boundaries of traditional hardware engineering.\n\nAs quantum computers become more practical, they will require specialized hardware components, which will create new opportunities for companies to develop and supply these advanced technologies. For more details, you can read our article about the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and other financial media websites to identify 12 computer hardware companies with market capitalizations of above $1 billion.

One of the key drivers of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) future growth is its entrance into AI, branded as Apple Intelligence. This advanced AI capability will be exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and newer models.\n\nOne of the key drivers of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) future growth is its entrance into AI, branded as Apple Intelligence, which was introduced in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference. For Apple Intelligence, the company announced that the latest operating systems for iPhones, Macs, and iPads will introduce a range of generative AI-driven features integrated into native applications. Many AI functions will operate directly on the device, while more complex processes will be managed by its servers through a new service known as Private Cloud Compute.\n\nFurthermore, the company announced that this service will utilize its proprietary server chips to support AI functionalities across all its devices. Lastly, Apple Intelligence will be accessible on the iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, as well as iPads and Macs with M1 and later models.\n\nAnalysts are optimistic that this could trigger a significant upgrade cycle for iPhones, potentially leading to a surge in sales as users seek the latest technology. On August 2, Citi raised the price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $255 from $210 and kept a Buy rating. The firm is particularly encouraged by early feedback on the new iOS18 features and the company’s potential to drive a major iPhone refresh cycle with its AI advancements.\n\nSimilarly, On August 2, Goldman Sachs also raised the price target on the stock to $275 from $265 and maintained a Buy rating. The firm highlighted the company’s strong performance in the iPhone sector and continued momentum in its services business. Goldman Sachs believes that it is on the verge of a significant multi-year replacement cycle for iPhones, which further enhances its confidence in the company’s future growth.\n\nIn summary, the company’s robust financial results, combined with its innovations in AI and strong performance in both hardware and services, position it well for continued success and increased market value.\n\nAs per the consensus opinion of 49 analysts, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a Moderate Buy rating. As of August 9, the average price target of $250.00 implies an upside of 15.61% to the stock’s current price.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of the best computer hardware stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA ‘Has Become A Wasteland’.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Warren Buffett may have heeded this ‘sell’ signal on Apple stock: While market cap quadrupled, profits only doubled",
        "content": "Remember 2016? Barack Obama was in the White House, Zika virus was the looming threat, \"The Sound of Silence\" by Disturbed raged on the rock charts, and Apple—yes that Apple—was a value stock.\n\nIndeed, none other than value-stock-loving Warren Buffett went on a buying spree starting in Q1 of 2016. By all the metrics that govern future returns, Apple ranked as an ideal investment during the entire period of Berkshire's major purchases, which lasted to Q1 of 2018. Take the mid-point of that span, June of 2017. At the time, Apple, based on fundamentals, little resembled the current version sporting a super-premium price and attracting such fabulous forecasts on Wall Street. Instead, it had all the qualities of a great value stock. Its market cap stood at $750 billion, and it was en route to posting $47 billion in GAAP net earnings for FY 2017 (ended September 30).\n\nThat put its PE at a lowly, unloved 16. As it does today, Apple was returning virtually all of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Stock returns have three components: Earnings growth, the total \"yield\" provided by dividends plus buybacks, and changes in the PE multiple. Because Apple's price was so low relative to its earnings, it boasted a yield of 1.7%, and the repurchases provided an additional boost of 4.4% by giving the remaining shares a bigger portion of the earnings. So investors were getting 6.1% from those two sources combined, plus future growth in profits, just if the multiple stayed well below the market average.\n\nThose numbers set an extremely low bar for achieving big returns. To reach 10%, Apple only had to grow net profits by 3.9%, since the dividend plus buyback combo were already contributing 6% plus, sans any increase in profits. Hitting that just under 4% bogey meant growing annual earnings by around $2 billion a year. Clinching that target looked like a light lift. Plus, any rise in that beaten-down PE would supply extra fuel.\n\nFor a few years, though, Apple's profits remained stuck in the $50 billion range. Then, in the stay at home pandemic economy, sales of its laptops and other staple gear for remote work exploded. Starting in FY 2022, Apple was booking nearly $100 billion in annual profits, twice the number three years earlier.\n\nThe rub: Apple's market cap ramped far faster than even the gigantic swing in earnings. By mid-June of this year, its valuation had swelled to $3.2 trillion, over four times the figure in mid-2017. Put simply, Apple's profits doubled and its market cap quadrupled, taking its PE from a modest 16 to towering 32. The former deep value play had morphed into the model of a super-high priced tech racer.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple stock forecast\n\nThe surge in Apple's price immensely reduced the power of its dividends and buybacks. Its yield has dropped from 1.7% in mid-2017 to a current, piddling 0.48%. Buybacks are now contributing an additional 3.1%, way down from the 4.4% when Buffett was loading up. Hence, the two combined provide a foundation of just 3.6%, less than two-thirds the old 6.1%. So just to provide 10% returns going forward, Apple must grow earnings by the difference of 6.4% (the 10% goal minus 3.6% from dividends plus buybacks). Of course, that formula assumes its PE stays at the current multiple exceeding 30.\n\nHow many billions does it take to raise profits 6.4% a year? The answer: $6.4 billion on top of today's base of $100 billion. That's over three times the bogey of $2 billion required in mid-2017. Here, Apple runs afoul of the law of large numbers. At current margins, it would need to raise sales by around $25 billion a year just to achieve that 10% return. What it would need to add annually equals 12% of Microsoft's average total revenues over the past three years. From the close of from FY 2021 to FY 2023, Apple's top line has grown by only $2.3 billion.\n\nPut simply, Apple will face a tough climb to keep compounding profits at 6% a year on a Brobdingnagian starting base of $100 billion. But it faces a second problem: The likelihood that its PE won't remain anywhere near the current level of 32.3. That's number for turbo-charged grower, not a mature player like Apple.\n\n9So let's posit that Apple indeed expands earnings at our 6% requirement that, combined with dividends and buybacks, would deliver a 10% return, assuming no change in valuation. In that case, it would be generating $120.5 billion in net GAAP profits by FY 2027.\n\nBut say its PE falls to 20, which is still above the long-term average for the S&P 500. Buybacks would help by raising earnings-per-share around 10%. But that's not enough. Even with the jump in profits and the repurchases, its shares would be selling at around $175, 17% below where they stand today.\n\nHence, Apple faces a pair of daunting challenges for rewarding investors. First, that it will be hard pressed growing profits fast enough from the $100 billion level, a number that's doubled post-pandemic, to compensate for the now-low contribution from buybacks and dividends. The second, related issue: Only companies promising big profits growth sustain huge multiples, and at its current size, Apple looks more like a plodder than a sprinter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Traders Hope Alphabet’s Pixel Event Can Stem $360 Billion Rout",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. investors are anxiously awaiting a Google hardware event on Tuesday — banking on new AI features to help stop a selloff that’s wiped out more than $360 billion in market value in just one month.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture How Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays Los Angeles Sees Remote Work Helping ‘No Car’ 2028 Olympic Games In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test\n\nGoogle is unveiling one of the biggest redesigns of its Pixel phones in their nearly decade-long history at an event starting at 10 a.m. in Mountain View, California. While the devices are usually an afterthought for investors because of their small revenue contribution relative to Google’s digital advertising business, expectations are high that new AI capabilities could demonstrate leadership in the highly competitive arena.\n\n“We’re hoping to get some solid information about the Google AI product to help turn around this period of profit taking,” said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder LLC. “It’s very helpful for investors to hear news like this and generally most of the time it’s positive news and helps the stock.”\n\nA boost is much needed. Alphabet shares have fallen 15% from a high in mid-July. They’ve come under pressure along with other megacaps amid concerns about slowing economic growth in the US and lofty valuations, while investors are increasingly worried that there’s relatively little to show for heavy spending on AI. Alphabet shares fell after second-quarter capital spending came in higher than expected as the company strives to outmatch rivals in AI.\n\nOver the past year, the perception of Google’s position in the race to deploy generative AI technologies has been critical to its stock performance. In February, Alphabet shares dropped more than 4% in a single day when Google paused image generation for its Gemini AI model after producing inaccurate historical depictions. In April, the stock rallied after unveiling updates to AI offerings for cloud customers.\n\nAt Tuesday’s event, Alphabet is expected to show more on-device AI offerings, driven by native integration of its Gemini large language model for text, image and voice-level features, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. “Advantages for Google’s Android in owning its foundational large language model are being highlighted by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence features, such as its integration with ChatGPT in version 18.1 of iOS,” analyst Mandeep Singh wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet’s recent selloff has left the stock hovering around the cheapest levels since March. It’s priced at 19 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from a high of nearly 24 times last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s at a discount to the average multiple in the S&P 500, which sits around 20.5 times.\n\n“The stock is pretty cheap for the massive free cash flow machine they are,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors Inc. “New AI will enhance the margin profile for ads and allow better pricing as we saw with Meta.”\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nDonald Trump and Elon Musk held a warm, but glitch-delayed conversation on X that saw the tech mogul pitch a role for himself should the Republican nominee win a second White House term.\n\nMusk also had a more subtle message for Trump supporters: Stop demonizing EVs. With its hardware event on Tuesday, Alphabet’s Google is trying to outshine Apple’s annual iPhone launch — and is letting longtime executive Rick Osterloh take center stage. India’s antitrust regulator will withdraw a report that found Apple abused its dominance of the domestic market, backtracking for now from its high-profile investigation into the US company.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nSea Ltd Tencent Music Madison Square Garden Sports Huya IHS Holding\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity The Fake Indian Cricket League Created for Real Online Betting What Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Why Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

But the agency withdrew those findings after Apple protested that sensitive, privileged information was contained in its report, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing non-public discussions.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the regulator can now seek to revive the probe, which would likely require restarting the process. Representatives for the watchdog didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment while Apple declined to comment.\n\nTech giants are grappling with growing scrutiny from regulators around the world, who accuse Apple and its peers of unfairly sustaining their dominance of markets from mobile apps to content.\n\nIt’s defending its app policies on multiple fronts, including a lawsuit at home in the US and via challenges in Europe, South Korea and Japan. It has consistently argued its commissions are justified by the security and peace of mind that the app store provides users, while giving developers a global showcase.\n\nIn India, the company controls just a single-percentage share of the 690 million-strong smartphone market, which is led by other foreign brands.

        "title": "3 Augmented Reality Stocks That Could Enhance User Experiences",
        "content": "The concept of augmented reality (AR) has overtaken virtual reality (VR) in much of the tech speculation sphere. That’s because the overall applications of augmented reality lend themselves more to day-to-day usage than VR’s mostly entertainment-focused sphere. For example, the most commonly touted sectors that AR could enhance are education, retail, healthcare and defense. With these industries backing the sector’s growth, there are a few augmented reality stocks to watch in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, many augmented reality stocks on this list come from companies with broader revenue streams than just AR, meaning investors get more security for their speculation into AR technology. Beyond this, investors can closely follow AR technology’s impact on these companies by looking into how their stocks respond to news of its development. Thus, whether by improving productivity or disrupting existing technological trends, these three augmented reality stocks could become lucrative long-term positions for investors.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve often discussed Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) slowdown in innovations in the consumer tech industry as a sign that the stock’s best days might be behind it. After all, the tech giant continues to release minor revisions to well-established products, lacking any serious market movers like it once produced. Yet, the company’s foray into augmented reality, which it insists on calling “spatial computing,” Vision Pro, is still somewhat of a nonstarter for most consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNo matter what it’s called, Apple’s move into AR stocks signals two things: it recognizes the market’s future potential and plans to refine its latest design over time. Just as with its previous products, Apple will make gradual improvements until it can reduce costs. This presents a chance to invest in a profitable blue-chip stock as Apple enters the AR market.\n\nMoreover, with the trend of releasing a budget model, usually under the “SE” or “Air” moniker, Apple could bring augmented reality to a much broader set of consumers should its applications justify it.\n\nLenovo Group (LNVGY) The logo for Lenovo Group Ltd (LNVGY) is displayed on a tall building front.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nLenovo Group (OTCMKTS:LNVGY), which has been widely recognized for its affordable consumer laptops, is making strides into the premium enterprise market with its augmented reality headset. This move likely aligns with predictions of the Chinese AR market reaching $12.4 billion by 2029, leveraging Lenovo’s strong position domestically. Even U.S. companies may find Lenovo’s specialized headset hard to overlook.\n\nCurrently, Lenovo offers the ThinkReality A3, a dedicated AR headset designed for manufacturing and engineering applications. This wearable glasses-style device excels at projecting real-time overlays into the user’s field of view, enabling features such as live training instructions for manufacturing equipment and virtual model sharing for design teams.\n\nIn essence, Lenovo is introducing a high-end product tailored to a niche of business users within its broader consumer electronics market. This AR venture holds both potential and security, making Lenovo a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSomewhat of an early adopter of virtual and augmented reality technology, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been relatively bullish about its products in the sector. For now, its recent partnership with EssilorLuxottica (OTCMKTS:ESLOY) to produce AR-powered Ray Bans has been slow to gain traction from day-to-day users. These slower adoption curves and high costs for the early AR glasses models keep the tech out of reach of the average person. Nevertheless, Meta continues to persist in its investment and development strategies, hoping to push AR adoption to a point where it becomes a tech mainstay.\n\nRecently, the company’s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, gave an interview in which he claimed the next iteration of Meta’s AR glasses will be a “big deal” as the company gets closer to revealing the upcoming generation. Yet, despite this confidence from Zuckerberg, the prototype won’t be available to the wider public until a consumer version is released in 2027. As such, buying Meta stock now would mean investing in the long-run of AR tech.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "content": "Google will use its upcoming phone launch to “get the jump” on its rivals and try to “claim leadership” of the AI market in smartphones, an expert has said.\n\nThe US firm is widely expected to introduce its Pixel 9 smartphone range during its Made by Google event on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe launch is taking place earlier than normal, and will see Google make its announcement before Apple unveils the next iPhone, which is traditionally introduced in September.\n\nBen Wood, smartphone expert and chief analyst at CCS Insight, said Google is trying to get ahead of its rival with new AI tools.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“It is interesting Google is holding this event in August rather than the usual timing of October. We believe this is an effort to get the jump on Apple’s iPhone event in September, particularly in terms of AI announcements,” he said.\n\n“Apple will likely focus on why the iPhone is ‘the best phone for AI’ and it would be no surprise to see some overlap in the potential use cases of the new Pixel phones and the new iPhone.\n\n“As a result, Google’s earlier announcement could let it announce new AI features first and claim leadership in this area.”\n\nAI-powered tools have become a key battleground for innovation in the tech sector.\n\nGoogle has introduced its own generative AI chatbot, Gemini, and the Pixel 9 range will be the first phones the company has built around the tool.\n\n“We expect Google to continue to flex its ‘camera capability’ muscles given the central role the camera now plays in the purchasing decision for a new smartphone,” Mr Wood said.\n\n“Additionally, Google will likely talk extensively about its Tensor chipset and how this gives it a competitive edge when it comes to delivering AI-powered experiences on the new phones.\n\n“Google will likely spend a lot of time talking about AI features and why its devices are better than rivals.\n\n“Anchor services like Circle to Search will be showcased – but also enhancements to how messages are handled, options to edit photos and more.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’ve also heard rumours of new features like ‘add me to this photo’, for when a person taking a group photo wants to add themselves to it. Google has often done a very good job of getting these ideas out ahead of others and we wouldn’t be surprised to see this happen again.”\n\nGoogle’s launch comes after Samsung brought its own suite of AI-powered tools to its foldable phone range.\n\nGalaxy AI was introduced to new Samsung phones in January with tools which can translate and transcribe conversations for users and help with photo-editing and other tasks.\n\nIn June, Apple previewed what it is calling Apple Intelligence, its plans to bring more artificial intelligence features to the iPhone later this year and beyond – including a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to integrate the AI chatbot into Apple software.",

        "title": "3 More Stocks Warren Buffett Might Sell to Prep for a Market Crash",
        "content": "We knew Warren Buffett occasionally pared his stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, usually for tax purposes. But no one was prepared for him to slash his stake in half.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha revealed in his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) earnings filing that his stake in the tech giant had dropped to fewer than 400 million shares. Apple’s value at the end of the quarter was just $84.2 billion, meaning Buffett shed just over 49% of his position. It’s still his largest holding. But where it once accounted for half of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, it’s now just 28% of the total.\n\nShares of Apple tumbled 5% on the news. While it recovered some lost ground, Apple remains 9% below its all-time high reached only a few weeks ago. But Apple wasn’t the only stock he sold. Additionally, Buffett cut his stake again Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), his second largest position.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHe did buy more shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), but Buffett was once again selling more stock than he was buying. He now has a cash hoard worth $277 billion. He’s either preparing for a market crash or planning on making a big purchase – a really big one.\n\nEither way, be on the lookout for more Warren Buffett stocks to sell in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Let’s examine three companies that could be next.\n\nCapital One Financial (COF) A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough several stocks could be on the chopping block, most are de minimis holdings that won’t move the needle. Capital OneFinancial (NYSE:COF), on the other hand, is one in which Buffett has a $1.7 billion position. Sure, that accounts for only 0.6% of the portfolio. But as Senator Everett Dirksen is supposed to have once said, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.\n\nIf Buffett’s massive sale of Apple stock was in anticipation of a market crash, then it would make sense to dump Capital One Financial. It is one of the most exposed credit card companies on the market, and it is acquiring Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). That will make it even more unprotected to a rising tide of delinquencies and defaults.\n\nThe Federal Reserve said total consumer credit outstanding stood at over $5 trillion at the end of June. In comparison, student loans amounted to $1.7 trillion and auto loans stood at just under $1.6 trillion. The consumer is nearing their limit, and if the economy hurtles into recession, credit card companies will be left holding the bag. That makes Capital One Financial a Warren Buffett stock to sell.\n\nStory continues\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A photo of both the Kraft and Heinz logo\n\nSource: Eyesonmilan/Shutterstock.com\n\nBuffett has never been hot on Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC), admitting the investment was a mistake. “I was wrong in a couple of ways about Kraft Heinz,” he told CNBC in 2019. “We overpaid for Kraft.” Though he did offer the caveat that he believes the company is “still a wonderful business.”\n\nBuffett helped private equity firm 3G Capital Managementengineer taking control of H.J. Heinz in 2013. He then maneuvered the ketchup maker to acquire Kraft Foods two years later. But he misjudged its value, paying about $100 billion for tangible assets when it used around $7 billion.\n\nSo, it is not the Kraft Heinz business that is the problem, just the price he paid for it. Still, it has been a money-losing bet for Buffett. Over the past decade, it has lost almost 7% in total return. Even though the Oracle of Omaha pulls in around a half-billion dollars annually in dividend checks, KHC stock is the seventh biggest position in Berkshire Hathaway representing around 4% of the total. The $11.5 billion parked in Kraft Heinz could be deployed somewhere better.\n\nJapanese Banks The yen currency symbol illustrated on a red and black background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBuffett owns a passel of Japanese banks. I’m not sure he would actually sell them because he is not the sort of investor to bail at the first hint of trouble. But it is notable that the Japanese banking system in part caused the market tremors last week.\n\nFive Japanese banks shares are in Berkshire Hathaway: Itochu (OTCMKTS:ITOCF, ITOCY), Marubeni (OTCMKTS:MARUF), Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF), Mitsui (OTCMKTS:MITSF) and Sumitomo (OTCMKTS:SSUMF, SSUMY). Buffett highly respects their management and has said U.S. bankers could learn a thing or two from their Japanese counterparts.\n\nThe problem for the Japanese banking system is the yen carry trade. That’s when investors borrow money in a low-interest rate country like Japan and invest in currencies in high-rate countries like the U.S.\n\nBut, Japan is raising its interest rates just as the U.S. is set to lower them. Unwinding all those trades created havoc as the Japanese central bank struggled to maintain equilibrium. All five of Buffett’s banks tumbled hard. While they did regain some losses, several are still down by double-digit percentages from where they traded a month ago.\n\nMitsui, Sumitomo and Marubeni are all down at least 13% from that time, making the Japanese banks Warren Buffett stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Google Looks to Get Jump on Apple With Earlier Pixel Launch",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With its hardware event on Tuesday, Alphabet Inc.’s Google is trying to outshine Apple’s annual iPhone launch — and is letting longtime executive Rick Osterloh take center stage.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture How Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space Los Angeles Sees Remote Work Helping ‘No Car’ 2028 Olympic Games Gottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays In DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test\n\nOsterloh, the former president of Motorola who joined Google in 2016, will helm the first major product launch after the company this year unified under his leadership the teams developing hardware and the Android operating system. The reorganization expanded Osterloh’s influence in the company and signaled that Google intends to compete in hardware for the long term.\n\nIn a sign of a more aggressive push into consumer devices, Google moved up its annual flagship Pixel smartphone launch to August from October, preempting the next Apple Inc. iPhone debut and seizing attention during a typically quiet period for the industry.\n\n“For the first time, I feel Alphabet is taking its hardware and the smartphone side pretty seriously,” said Mandeep Singh, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “That is a reflection of Rick’s leadership and what he has done.”\n\nGoogle has invested heavily in its Pixel line, including designing its own chip, sponsoring NBA playoffs games and handing devices to superstar players like Giannis Antetokounmpo. And yet, it continues to trail Apple at the high end of the market. Android partner Samsung Electronics Co. has locked up much of the rest of that segment in the US, leaving little room for insurgents, even ones as influential as Google.\n\nTough competition hasn’t slowed the rise of Osterloh’s star within Google, and handing him unilateral control of the company’s consumer offerings — at the expense of Hiroshi Lockheimer, who previously oversaw Android — may be a move to ensure Google can capitalize on the current push to monetize AI through devices.\n\n“The scope of Osterloh’s role is considerable. It not only applies to Android but also other key platforms such as Chrome,” said CCS Insight Chief Analyst Ben Wood. “It could signal the realization by Google it needs a more cohesive approach across platforms, particularly as the AI battle intensifies.”\n\nThe latest wave of generative artificial intelligence features has the potential to revive consumer interest in smartphones and prompt them to upgrade their devices more regularly, Singh said. Samsung has positioned its Galaxy lineup as an AI-first offering this year, and it reported that its Galaxy S24 series notched double-digit sales growth over its predecessor. Apple has also signaled it intends to sell iPhones on the strength of a suite of new features it calls Apple Intelligence.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle’s Pixel line, which dates as far back as Osterloh’s tenure with the company, has stood out due to its embrace of AI in its camera software. It’s delivered groundbreaking advancements like Night Sight, a photography mode that’s been emulated across the mobile industry, including by Apple. And Google’s development of a Tensor mobile chip, designed in house, gives the company a differentiating feature against other Android contenders.\n\nBy holding its hardware showcase a month ahead of the iPhone maker’s largest annual event, Google is “frontrunning Apple and also making a statement that we are likely way ahead of what Apple will show for iPhone 16 at least,” Singh said. Google has at least a six-month head start on Apple, which has invested less in AI over the years than some of its Big Tech peers, he added.\n\nGoogle’s strategy — tying together the development of hardware, software and services — carries echoes of Apple’s successful approach to designing devices. Yet, as Osterloh seeks to capitalize on the opportunity presented by AI, he faces a perennial challenge for Google: bringing the fight to Apple without threatening key relationships with hardware giants such as Xiaomi Corp. that rely on the Android operating system.\n\nAndroid President Sameer Samat said in an interview that his team maintains strict information-sharing boundaries to ensure its projects with the Pixel team and partners such as Samsung don’t bleed into one another. Yet the team’s position under Osterloh’s stewardship will smooth the path of Google’s AI from labs to Android partners, Samat said.\n\n“It allows us to take some of our AI innovation and actually bring it to more of the ecosystem more quickly,” he added. “It’s all been about trying to move faster around our AI endeavor and improving the consumer experience.”\n\nShortly after starting in his new role, Osterloh traveled to South Korea to meet his Samsung counterpart, TM Roh, to ensure the partnership and collaboration between the two companies continues smoothly. He also attended Samsung’s Unpacked product launch event in July, promising to bring Google’s AI-powered experiences “to all Android devices.”\n\nDue to the complexity of switching from Apple to Android devices, any gains Google makes in hardware are likely to come at the expense of Android partners, which could be a helpful force in and of itself, Singh said.\n\nIt will pressure those brands to “move faster,” Singh said. “And overall I think it will just strengthen Google’s ecosystem.”\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Davey Alba.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity The Fake Indian Cricket League Created for Real Online Betting What Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Why Leaders Have a Hard Time Knowing When to Leave\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s ‘Ignore the Chatter’ Guide: 10 Stocks to Buy Today.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Jim Cramer-approved stocks.\n\nOn his Friday show, Jim Cramer discussed the \"tyranny of larger macro forces,\" lamenting how the market has become overly fixated on broad economic indicators like interest rates and the Fed's actions instead of keeping their eyes on the prize—great stocks with great stories.\n\nThe “short-term guessing game based on the data point of the day” can blindside investors to the long-term glory of what is in front of them, according to Cramer, who also expressed his disdain for ETFs by stating:\n\n“..there could be a pickup in semiconductors if the economy accelerates so we buy an ETF that has semis rather than just going after Nvidia for AI or Texas Instruments for the Internet of Things.”\n\nThe backdrop to these comments was the U.S. stock market experiencing a significant rally following the release of encouraging jobless claims data. The S&P 500 jumped by 2.3%, reflecting widespread gains across multiple sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by 683 points, highlighting strong performance among blue-chip stocks, while the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.87%, driven by a rebound in technology and growth stocks.\n\nThis rebound helped the S&P 500 recover nearly all losses from earlier in the week, when recession fears and the unwinding of a global yen-funded carry trade led to a sharp decline.\n\nAnalyzing Jim Cramer’s recent “Mad Money” episodes, we made a list of 10 stocks that the veteran CNBC host is bullish on. These are companies that are well-poised for long-term growth, given that investors are able to hold their ground and “ignore the chatter.”\n\nThe reason we track what hedge funds are doing and their favorite stocks is simple. Our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nCramer called the iPhone-maker “the usual suspect of the Magnificent 7”, explaining how blue-chip tech led the session after news of encouraging jobless claims hit the market on Friday morning.\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley recently maintained its \"Buy\" rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $273, highlighting the stock's potential for a 28.4% upside.

        "title": "7 Stocks You Need to Buy Before the 2025 Recession Starts",
        "content": "Are we on the cusp of a recession? Several key indicators are flashing red, and if history is any guide, trouble could be brewing for the U.S. economy in 2025. You’ve probably heard about the inverted yield curve, which has been a reliable recession predictor in the past. When long-term interest rates fall below short-term rates, it’s often a sign that investors are pessimistic about the near-term economic outlook. And they often begin looking for stocks with potential to for weather the forecast recession.\n\nThe Sahm Rule recession indicator is another one to watch. It signals the start of a recession when the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low in the previous 12 months. This indicator has never triggered a false alarm outside of a recession since the 1970s.\n\nSpeaking of unemployment, it tends to rise rapidly heading into a recession but falls slowly during the recovery. We saw this pattern play out in the 2007-2009 recession. And while unemployment didn’t follow the usual script in 2020 due to the unique nature of the pandemic, it’s an important metric to monitor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven the Oracle of Omaha himself, Warren Buffett, has been selling stocks for seven straight quarters. When Buffett starts playing defense, it’s worth taking notice. The recent carry trade rout in the markets is another warning sign.\n\nI’m not saying you should panic and exit the market entirely. However, it may be prudent to take some profits on high-flying tech names and cyclical stocks. Instead, consider rotating into defensive sectors and recession-resistant stocks. Here are seven to look into:\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nYou probably don’t need an explanation about what McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) does. Its stock has struggled a little recently, but I still believe McDonald’s is a stock you need to buy before the potential 2025 recession hits. Why? Just look at how this company has performed in past downturns. In 2008, while the rest of the market tanked, McDonald’s stock actually went up, and so did its financials. Fast forward to the 2020 COVID shock that devastated the restaurant industry. McDonald’s proved its resilience yet again, with drive-thrus and digital orders making up for lost dine-in sales.\n\nIts franchised restaurants count has also been increasing non-stop for the past few years. Stocks for recession: MCD franchised restaurants chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPeople simply gravitate toward cheap, comforting, fast food when times get tough. McDonald’s gets this, so they recently launched a new $5 value meal deal to lure back cash-strapped customers. While some analysts have downgraded the stock, the consensus still rates MCD a “Moderate Buy” with an average price target of $302. The stock also comes with a 2.46% dividend yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nChurch & Dwight (CHD) boxes of Arm & Hammer baking soda\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nChurch & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) manufactures and markets a range of household, personal care and specialty products. The company recently reported strong Q2 2024 results, with organic sales growth of 4.7% driven by successful new product launches like Arm & Hammer Deep Clean detergent and Batiste dry shampoos. Despite some signs of consumer weakness, Church & Dwight has been one of the most stable and consistent compounders over the past few decades. I don’t believe any recession can throw this company off track.\n\nChurch & Dwight sells very sticky consumer staples products, and the recent pullback to around $100 per share puts the valuation at a reasonable level. Sure, some will point to the stock trading at 30 times forward earnings, but I wouldn’t lose sleep over it. This company has a history of recovering quickly from downturns, and blue-chip names like CHD often command a premium for their safety. The 1.1% dividend yield provides a nice sweetener as well.\n\nAutozone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nI believe AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) has been one of the best compounders over the past few decades, thanks to the booming auto repair industry. This trend should continue, and the company is well-positioned to weather a recession relatively unscathed. In tough economic times, people are more likely to repair their existing vehicles rather than upgrade to new ones. The biggest tailwind for AutoZone is the aging U.S. vehicle fleet. The average passenger car is now 12.6 years old, a record high. A recession could actually boost demand for AutoZone’s products and services.\n\nIn their latest quarterly report, AutoZone posted impressive results, with earnings per share of $36.69, beating estimates by 44 cents, though revenue of $4.24 billion slightly missed expectations. The company is progressing on strategic initiatives like expanding its mega hub store network to improve parts availability and delivery speed. AutoZone’s stock has recently outperformed the broader retail sector, rising nearly 10% over the past month. Autozone has also been one of the most shareholder-friendly companies in the past decade due to its aggressive buybacks. Autozone buybacks chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nOf course, no company is recession-proof, and AutoZone would likely see some slowdown in a severe downturn. Rising interest rates could pressure consumer spending. However, most analysts remain bullish. AutoZone deserves a spot in your portfolio if you’re looking for a resilient retailer that can thrive in good times and bad.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is a holding company with diverse businesses under its umbrella. The conglomerate has been making headlines lately as Warren Buffett continues his selling spree. Berkshire sale of investment chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIn Q2 2024 alone, Buffett offloaded over $75 billion (net) in equities, including nearly half of Berkshire’s massive Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake. This has ballooned Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $276.9 billion.\n\nWhile some may view this defensive move as concerning, I believe the Oracle of Omaha is wisely preparing for the potential storm ahead. Sure, Berkshire isn’t immune to market downturns. Its stock took a hit in 2008, just like the broader market. But this time around, Buffett seems to have learned from past mistakes. He’s been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters, opting instead to stockpile Treasury bills. Berkshire now owns more than the Fed!\n\nI view the stock as more of a rebound play. Once valuations become attractive again, you can bet Buffett will swoop in and scoop up bargains to ride the next rally. In the meantime, Berkshire’s operating earnings remain robust, jumping 15% in Q2 thanks to strength in its wholly-owned businesses like auto insurer GEICO.\n\nFlowers Foods (FLO) A hand holds a bag of Dave's Killer Bread at the grocery store\n\nSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.com\n\nFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) bakes and markets packaged bakery foods in the United States. The company has faced some challenges recently, with its stock price declining 8.4% over the past year and trading about 24% below its all-time high.\n\nI used to consider Flowers Foods one of the most consistent and stable companies in the stock market. Its performance has been very impressive since the stock has been one of the most reliable in its size range. I can’t think of any company that trades with a market capitalization of around $5 billion that has been this steady.\n\nHowever, I said “used to,” since Flowers Foods has broken the trajectory it was on for over 20 years. The stock is now up just 2% in the past five years. Despite these headwinds, I still think it’s a good buy at this range. The company has already faced significant pressure, and a lot of bearishness seems priced in right now.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Flowers Foods grew sales 2.8% year-over-year to $1.58 billion, though its net income increased a more modest 3.3% to $73 million. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.25 per share in fiscal 2024, putting the stock at a reasonable 18 times forward earnings.\n\nI believe Flowers Foods can weather a potential recession well given the inelastic demand for its products. As it recovers, you can sit back and collect the stock’s hefty 4.2% dividend yield. While the road may be bumpy in the near term, for long-term investors, Flowers Foods looks like a solid buy-and-hold at these levels.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nDoes Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) even need an introduction? It’s one of the world’s most recognizable brands, with an unrivaled global supply network that governments have tapped for emergencies. I believe the drink is unlikely to become irrelevant anytime soon and should sell just as well during a recession. Even if sales dip, you’ll be well-compensated over time with KO’s attractive 2.8% dividend yield. The stock has impressed, rising nearly 15% year-to-date despite the tech rout dragging down markets.\n\nDespite facing some challenges like calls for boycotts in certain regions and a massive unresolved $16 billion tax dispute, Coca-Cola reported solid second-quarter 2024 results, with 15% organic revenue growth and 7% comparable EPS growth. The company even raised its full-year 2024 guidance on the back of this momentum. This organic revenue growth has been very impressive in the post-COVID era. KO organic revenue chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nKO stock looks fairly valued after earnings. All in all, Coca-Cola remains a resilient blue-chip staple to consider for a defensive 2025 recession portfolio.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a consumer goods giant that produces household essentials like Tide laundry detergent, Charmin toilet paper and Gillette razors. In Q4 2024, P&G reported solid results with 4% organic sales growth, 12% core EPS growth and strong cash flow. The company has delivered consistent mid-single digit organic growth over the past several years through its integrated strategy focused on superiority, productivity and an agile organization.\n\nNow, I know P&G is a cliché pick for any list of recession-resistant stocks, but that’s only because it’s so obvious. Let’s be real, consumers will not stop buying Tide pods or Crest toothpaste just because the economy hits a rough patch. P&G’s products are sticky and generate reliable revenue streams.\n\nThat said, don’t expect P&G shares to be completely immune if a recession strikes. The stock has declined significantly in past downturns, and I wouldn’t be shocked to see it correct again. But if you’re investing for the long haul, you really can’t go wrong owning P&G. A few years from now, you’ll be glad you bought it, even if there are some short-term bumps. Plus, you can collect that sweet 2.36% dividend yield while you ride out any volatility.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling That Wall Street Doesn't Know About",
        "content": "Few investors command Wall Street's attention quite like Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking the reins in 1965, the appropriately named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has nearly doubled up the annualized total return of the benchmark S&P 500. On an aggregate basis, Buffett has overseen a gain of 5,174,441% in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on August 7.\n\nGiven how decisively Warren Buffett has crushed the S&P 500, it's no surprise that investors eagerly await clues as to what he and his team have been buying and selling. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nTraditionally, these \"clues\" come in the form of a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F is a quarterly filing that provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest (and richest) money managers have purchased and sold. Berkshire's 13F detailing its activity during the June-ended quarter is slated for release after the closing bell on August 14.\n\nBut you don't always have to wait for Berkshire's 13F to know what the Oracle of Omaha and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been up to. Thanks to the company's quarterly operating results, annual shareholder meeting, and Form 4 filings with the SEC, we already know about three big moves that have been made.\n\nBased on these various clues, which I'll touch on in more detail in a moment, I'd opine that Buffett is selling two additional holdings that Wall Street and investors don't yet know about.\n\nWarren Buffett has been a big-time net-seller of equities\n\nOne stock we absolutely know the Oracle of Omaha has been dumping is Berkshire Hathaway's longtime top holding, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Based on fair value estimates for Apple (as of June 30), which were highlighted in Berkshire's second-quarter operating results, we can approximate that nearly half of the 789.37 million shares that were held as of March 31 were sold over the subsequent three months.\n\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett suggested that corporate tax rates were liable to increase in the coming years. Given the sizable unrealized investment gains in Apple Berkshire's investment team is sitting on, Buffett believed that locking in some gains now, at a lower tax rate, would be, in hindsight, viewed favorably by the investing community.\n\nBerkshire's annual meeting also shed light on another disposition that was widely telegraphed. Buffett admitted that he -- and he alone -- had sold the entirety of his company's remaining stake in legacy media company Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA). This remaining stake totaled 7,531,765 shares, as of March 31.\n\nStory continues\n\nLegacy media companies like Paramount have been upended by streaming services and the high costs associated with building out the content libraries needed to compete for subscribers. Despite reducing its direct-to-consumer segment losses, Paramount has struggled to regain its footing. Buffett ultimately bit the bullet prior to Berkshire's shareholder meeting and dumped the remaining position.\n\nFurthermore, Form 4 filings tell us that Buffett and his team have been actively selling shares of No. 2 holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Shareholders with a 10% or greater stake in a company are required to file Form 4 anytime shares are bought or sold.\n\nOver 12 consecutive trading sessions (July 17 – Aug. 1), Buffett collectively sold 90,422,124 shares of Bank of America stock, totaling about $3.82 billion. There are a number of logical reasons for this position to be pared down by around 9%, including BofA's higher book value and the potential for a rate-easing cycle to commence in the coming months -- BofA is the most interest-sensitive of the money-center banks. But more than anything, this selling activity appears to be a warning to Wall Street that the stock market is incredibly pricey.\n\nBuffett has sold more equities than he's purchased for seven consecutive quarters, with $131.6 billion in aggregate net-equity sales since Oct. 1, 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo stocks Buffett is likely selling that Wall Street doesn't know about yet\n\nIn two days, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F will reveal the full scope of what moves were made in the second quarter.\n\nHowever, Berkshire's second-quarter operating results offer a big clue as to what other trades may have been executed. More specifically, the fair value cost basis for the company's \"Commercial, industrial, and other\" segment declined from $46.026 billion on March 31, 2024 to $45.006 billion on June 30, 2024. This segment excludes financial stocks and consumer products, but includes a host of other sectors and industries.\n\nBased on this fair value information, I believe Buffett pared down his stake in another top holding and completely exited one of Berkshire's smaller value plays.\n\nPrediction: Buffett pared down his stake in Chevron for a second consecutive quarter\n\nLet me preface this first prediction by noting that Warren Buffett would never bet against America. Nevertheless, Buffett isn't oblivious to the possibility of a big sell-off in the stock market. Equities are historically pricey, and the potential for energy commodities to take it on the chin if the U.S. economy falls into a recession is palpable.\n\nWith the above being said, it's a near-certainty that Buffett sold close to 4 million shares of oil and gas stock Chevron(NYSE: CVX) during the second quarter.\n\nAlthough Wall Street has been laser-focused on Apple's fair value decline from the sequential quarter, they've overlooked that Chevron's $18.6 billion fair value, as of June 30, is about $0.6 billion shy of where it should be, assuming Buffett hadn't sold a single share.\n\nFurther, Berkshire Hathaway's brightest investment minds sold roughly 3.11 million shares of Chevron during the first quarter. Once the train gets rolling in either direction, it's pretty common for buying or selling activity to be a multi-quarter event for a security held by Buffett's company.\n\nLastly, with Buffett referring to Occidental Petroleum as an \"indefinite\" holding in his most recent annual letter to shareholders, there may not be a need to have so much capital tied up in Chevron. After all, energy stocks have rarely played a key role in Berkshire's Hathaway's investment portfolio. As Berkshire's position in Occidental grows, it wouldn't be surprising to see a corresponding reduction in its stake in Chevron.\n\nPrediction: The Oracle of Omaha completely exited his company's position in Louisiana-Pacific\n\nMy second prediction is that the Oracle of Omaha and/or his investment aides showed Louisiana-Pacific(NYSE: LPX) to the door. Louisiana-Pacific is a provider of siding/outdoor building solutions used primarily in new construction.\n\nWhen the first quarter came to a close, Berkshire held 6,597,947 shares of this premier building solutions company. However, 446,942 shares were sold in the March-ended quarter. With Berkshire's investment team often increasing or reducing their positions over the span of multiple quarters, it seems logical to expect this selling activity to have ramped up in the second quarter.\n\nBut there's more to this prediction than just \"it's what Buffett usually does.\"\n\nWhen Treasury yields soared on the heels of the Federal Reserve's steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, it sent 30-year mortgage rates to a 23-year high last October. Bringing the existing-home sales market to a crawl opened the door for new home sales to thrive. Suppliers like Louisiana-Pacific were key beneficiaries.\n\nHowever, with the Fed set to begin cutting interest rates, and mortgage rates declining, the luster for homebuilders and their suppliers may begin to wear off.\n\nThe other issue for Louisiana-Pacific is that it's no longer a particularly intriguing investment from a value perspective -- its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.4 is 78% above its average forward-year multiple over the trailing-five-year period. All the necessary catalysts to encourage Buffett and his team to lock in gains are there.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Declares Shift: Selling Apple Stock To Invest In This 'Magnificent' Megacap – Here's Why",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, arguably America’s most successful investor, is at it again. His latest moves in the stock market have captured the attention of investors. Under his control since 1965, he has led Berkshire Hathaway (BRK. A, BRK. B) to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 with his calculated decisions.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share. This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nBuffett’s large stake in Apple (AAPL) has been a source of intrigue for years. Berkshire Hathaway began buying AAPL shares in 2016, and the technology giant became one of its largest holdings. Buffett previously had nice things to say about the technology giant, referring to it as a “better business” than other companies in Berkshire’s portfolio. Despite those positive comments, recent moves suggest Buffett is changing his strategy with Apple.\n\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nAccording to a report by CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway drastically reduced its stake from 905 million in Apple as of December 2023 to 400 million by June 2024, a 55% decline. Nobody might have expected this since Buffett has been a big admirer of the tech giant.\n\nPerhaps this carries the sell-off reasoning toward Apple’s recent performance. The company still posted revenues of $85.8 billion in the June quarter – 4.8% above the same period last year – but the future outlook was grim.\n\nSee Also: Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nSales on the Chinese market, a key market for Apple, plummeted by 6%, and the company’s operating income fared even worse with a 10% decrease. It lost its previous position in the top five smartphone companies within China, while competitive brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi fared very well. These problems and a valuation that some analysts believe appears stretched may have prompted Buffett to reassess his stance.\n\nDespite trimming Berkshire's stake in Apple, Buffett remains bullish on another investment: Berkshire Hathaway. He has repurchased $5 billion of Berkshire shares in the last three quarters, indicating a bright outlook. “With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation,” he wrote in a recent shareholder letter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending:Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s financial results have been outstanding despite its ups and downs. In June, the company reported a 1.2% revenue gain to $93.7 billion and a 16% rise in operating earnings to $11.6 billion.\n\nThe insurance group did particularly well, with earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investment up 56%. However, Berkshire’s GAAP net income dropped by 16%, to $30.3 billion, a number Buffett has called one that investors should pay very little attention to because of the volatility of unrealized gains and losses on stock investments.\n\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\n\nAnalysts have long forecast Berkshire’s operating earnings to increase 10% in 2024 and then reduce by 3% growth in 2025. With Buffett’s ongoing buyback program, this would have given the appearance that he is getting extreme value for Berkshire Hathaway, even as he reduces his exposure to other assets, such as Apple.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway could very well be a godsend for investors seeking a safe and stable long-term investment. If Warren Buffett continues to express so much faith in his own company, this might well be a green light for others to do the same.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWhen today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Warren Buffett Declares Shift: Selling Apple Stock To Invest In This 'Magnificent' Megacap – Here's Why originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Dominating the Artificial Intelligence Chip Market, but Apple Has Been Securing Supply From Another Tech Giant",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a scorching-hot buy over the past couple of years, largely due to the key role it plays in artificial intelligence (AI). The company's AI chips are crucial for companies that are developing AI models. And Nvidia has a commanding 80% market share when it comes to AI chips. That's part of the reason why investors have remained bullish on the stock -- it's arguably the best-positioned stock to benefit from growing demand for AI.\n\nBut given how lucrative the opportunities are in AI, it's only a matter of time before more competitors emerge and fight for market share. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has recently turned to one of those unexpected competitors to source chips for its new AI-powered iPhones.\n\nApple has bought chips from Alphabet\n\nOne of the companies that has been developing its own chips is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). And Apple has been training its new AI system, called \"Apple Intelligence,\" using Alphabet's custom chips, according to a research paper. The company used two versions of Google's tensor processing unit to develop its AI models, which gives iPhone users access to generative AI features, including advanced writing tools, the ability to generate images, and a Siri assistant with \"all-new superpowers.\"\n\nCould more competition be on the way?\n\nAlphabet is a potentially strong competitor for Nvidia to worry about. The company has plenty of resources to work with. Last year, Alphabet generated more than $69 billion in free cash flow. It has been investing in its AI chatbot Gemini, and AI chips could provide it with yet another growth opportunity to pile money into.\n\nThe courts recently found that the company's search engine, Google, has an illegal monopoly. And depending on what the consequences of that finding are, Alphabet may soon see a huge incentive to find a new growth opportunity to pursue, as the ruling may have a detrimental effect on a key part of its business.\n\nBeyond Alphabet, however, there are other competitors for Nvidia to worry about. Meta Platforms has been working on an AI chip of its own, as has Amazon. And investors also shouldn't forget about AMD, which is a more traditional rival for Nvidia. Although it has been late to the game, AMD has made it clear that AI is a big priority for the business, and it could also take away some sizable market share from Nvidia in the future.\n\nShould Nvidia investors be worried?\n\nNvidia has generated incredible gains due to its dominance in the AI chip space. And it is working on innovating and coming out with more advanced chips to ensure it remains on top. But maintaining such a large market share can be incredibly difficult, especially with so many big tech companies out there with deep pockets to contend with. They aren't simply going to ignore such a massive opportunity in AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's revenue has taken off over the past year, with Nvidia's growth rate in recent quarters being well in excess of 200%. Those kinds of numbers, while extremely impressive, are also extremely difficult to maintain. At some point, Nvidia's growth rate will start to come down, especially if more competition emerges in the field. And its high-priced chips may also need to come down in price if that's the case, which may lead to both a slowing growth rate and smaller profit margins than the 50%-plus margins it has been averaging of late.\n\nIs Nvidia's stock still a buy?\n\nNvidia's stock has been giving back some gains in recent weeks, but it's still a top company to invest in if you want exposure to the red-hot AI market. While other companies may try to take market share from Nvidia, that doesn't mean that they will be able to do so overnight.\n\nNvidia is still in an excellent position to continue growing, but I would expect its growth rate and margins to come down a bit in future quarters, especially as companies potentially reduce AI spending due to a possible economic slowdown. Nvidia's stock may struggle in the near term, but as long you're willing to hang on for the long term, it can still make for a good buy. Still, you should brace for some challenges ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Foxconn is hiring more shift workers with higher wages at the world's largest iPhone factory in the Henan provincial capital of Zhengzhou, ahead of the September launch of the 16th edition of Apple's iconic smartphone.\n\nThe assembler, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, recruited more than 50,000 workers in Zhengzhou over the past two weeks, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nThe hourly wage at the factory has risen to 26 yuan (US$3.63) in August from 25 yuan in July, while a bonus of up to 7,500 yuan is on offer for returning staff with working experience at the plant, the National Business Daily reported, citing labour agencies.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: SCMP/Cissy Zhou>\n\nThe flagship factory is known for aggressive hirings ahead of major product launches, giving a high turnover rate for its workforce of more than 1 million staff.\n\nDuring the peak production season, the average monthly wage can range from 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan inclusive of extra work. During low seasons, the average wage can drop to between 3,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan, as overtime work becomes infrequent.\n\nFoxconn's officials did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday, outside normal business hours.\n\nApple's next smartphone launch is one of its most anticipated events as the Cupertino, California-based company is counting on an upgrade with artificial intelligence (AI) built in to boost sales. It set the goal of shipping at least 90 million iPhone 16 devices in the second half of this year, a 10 per cent growth compared to the previous generation.\n\nApple faces more competitions from local phone makers including Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo. As China's smartphone market accelerated its growth momentum in the second quarter, Apple was squeezed out of top five vendors, with a 3.1 per cent year-on-year decline in shipment despite cutting prices to promote demand, according to data from IDC.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreater China, Apple's third-largest market comprising the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the only declining regional market for Apple. The tech giant's revenue in the region dropped 6.5 per cent to US$14.73 billion in the June quarter, compared with last year.\n\nThe uncertainty regarding the fate of much-anticipated Apple Intelligence in China's market could also weigh on iPhone sales in the country.\n\nDespite relocating some of its production bases out of China, Foxconn signed a deal in late July with the Henan provincial government for a new manufacturing project, for which it will invest 1 billion yuan to build new business headquarters and a research and development centre in Zhengzhou.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Apple Inc. (AAPL): Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About This Stock Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds.\n\nWarren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19.8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9.9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills.\n\nBuffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally.\n\nThe significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies.\n\nThe investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks.\n\nHigh-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.  Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market.\n\nDiversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10.7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15.8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29.6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake.\n\nThe billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment.\n\nIn the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10.\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway’s Q1 Stake Value: $135.36 Billion\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the most valuable companies in the world in terms of market capitalization and is one stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. The company stands out owing to its leading iPhone product line, which has always been the key driver of revenues. Likewise, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is increasingly reducing its reliance on hardware sales, focusing on services led by Apple Music, cloud computing and App Store.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirmed that the integration of a slew of artificial intelligence features into its hardware is one factor expected to reinvigorate demand for its iPhones, which has slowed in the recent past. With AI expected to inject new life into Apple products, it remains one of the stocks worth paying attention to.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains Buffett's biggest holding, with stakes worth $135.36 billion despite trimming stakes by 13% in the first quarter. A total of 150 hedge funds held stakes in the company as of the end of the first quarter, an improvement from 131 as of the aid of 2023.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds.

        "title": "Warren Buffett’s sale of 510 million Apple shares will go down as one of the best bets of his career",
        "content": "Starting in Q1 of 2024, Warren Buffett epically downsized his immense holdings of Apple stock in one of the best-publicized selloffs by any famous investor in recent memory. In the past two quarters, the Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway has sold roughly 510 million of the iPhone-maker's shares, lightening its holdings by around 56%. The size and suddenness of the exit stirred speculation that Buffett's optimism for Apple's stock had faded following the fantastic run over the past seven years—a surge that Buffett timed and rode to near-perfection.\n\nIt's important to note that Apple remains Berkshire's biggest equity holding, comprising 41% of the conglomerate's portfolio. At the annual meeting in May, Buffett's admiration for Apple appeared undimmed. He declared that two of his long-time prized investments, Coca-Cola and American Express, were \"wonderful\" businesses, but that lauded Apple as \"an even better one.\"\n\nBuffett isn't saying why he shed such a large portion of his Apple stake, and we simply don't we don't know whether, going forward, he'll maintain a giant position in what's still the world's most valuable enterprise. What's clear is that overall, he's taking a far more defensive position in a pricey market. Berkshire sold $90 billion in stocks in the first half of 2024, the Apple dump accounting for the vast bulk of the proceeds.\n\nThat downshift raised Berkshire's cash holdings from the previous record of $189 billion at the close of Q1, to $278 billion. As disclosed in its 10Q, Berkshire further swelled its war chest in July by selling around $4 billion in shares of Bank of America, in recent years its second largest holding, and a stock that like Apple, Buffett bought on the cheap that's proven a fabulously profitable bet. Buffett's now amassed new loads of extra cash for channeling into beaten-down choices that look as enticing as Apple or Bank of America did years ago.\n\nIt's hard to find a better case of \"selling high\" than Buffett's Apple gambit. Examining the trajectory of colossus of Cupertino's profit and valuation numbers, it's clear that the shares have run from a screaming bargain (PE of 16) when Buffett bought them to dangerously expensive (PE of 32) by the time he began taking profits in a big way. Apple's stock price has reached such a dizzying summit that the current shareholders, or folks and funds who buy now, stand little chance of reaping double-digit returns in the years ahead. And the currently super-elevated valuation means that a major correction is far more likely now than, say, just before the pandemic's outbreak, when Apple fetched one-third today's price.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever it's interesting that Buffett missed the \"top tick\" on Apple shares. They ended Q2 at $211—the close of Berkshire's selling period—before ramping 12% to a record $235 on July 16. Since then, Apple's been caught in the maelstrom that's roiling the Magnificent Seven, a battering that as of August 8, sent shares back to $211 where it started the quarter. News of the Berkshire unloading three days earlier was a big contributor to Apple's fall.\n\nBut American champion's the victim not of poor performance, but overheated expectations and excessive enthusiasm from the markets. Buffett saw in 2016 that the outlook on Apple was far too dour, and made one of the great wagers of his career. It made eminent sense to harvest much of those fabulous gains, and soften the hit if as is likely, Apple's fans are expecting far, far too much.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Amazon 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Full disclosure: I own shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and am bullish about its prospects. I think the company will continue to reign as the No. 1 e-commerce platform and cloud services provider. It won't surprise me in the least if Amazon's market cap doubles or more by the end of the decade.\n\nThat said, Amazon won't be the biggest stock on the market despite delivering strong gains, in my view. I predict the following three stocks will be worth more than Amazon 10 years from now.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) briefly forfeited its throne earlier this year as the company with the biggest market cap. It could do so again. Nonetheless, I expect it will still be worth more than Amazon in 2034.\n\nAmazon's market cap is roughly $1.5 trillion lower than Apple's right now. The only way it could make up that gap is if Apple performs dismally. I wouldn't bet on that happening.\n\nSure, Apple's iPhone sales growth has evaporated in recent years. That could soon change, though. Apple Intelligence (the company's name for its generative artificial intelligence [GenAI] capabilities) will run only on iPhone 15 Pro and later models. Several Wall Street analysts project that GenAI could spark a huge iPhone upgrade supercycle. I agree with their reasoning.\n\nDon't overlook the potential for 6G to be another massive growth driver for Apple. The next generation of wireless technology could be available early in the next decade. It could be a game-changer in ushering in widespread adoption of augmented reality and perhaps even holographic displays on Apple's iPhones.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't too far behind Apple, with a market cap hovering around $3 trillion. I don't see Amazon vaulting past the tech giant over the next 10 years, even if it delivers stronger growth (which I suspect could happen).\n\nAmazon and Microsoft share at least one key growth driver: organizations' migration of apps and data to the cloud. Although Microsoft Azure is a distant second to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud services market now, I think the gap will narrow over time.\n\nMicrosoft's ace in the hole could be its relationship with OpenAI. It has already integrated GPT-4 throughout its product suite and cloud offerings. If GPT-5 fulfills its potential, it and future large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI and adopted by Microsoft could fuel tremendous growth for both companies.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap of $2 trillion isn't too much greater than Amazon's. I predict the Google parent will still be ahead of Amazon 10 years from now for a few key reasons.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet could gain ground on AWS in the cloud services market. Its Google Cloud is already growing much faster than AWS. Google's AI expertise could enable it to accelerate this growth.\n\nI also think technologies of the future could provide massive tailwinds for Alphabet. The company is already racing to develop AI-powered agents that perform lots of tasks for customers. It's a leader in quantum computing. 6G could present a fantastic opportunity for Google Pixel smartphones and other Android devices. And with Waymo, Alphabet is poised to be one of the biggest winners in what could be a multitrillion-dollar robotaxi market.\n\nHow I could be wrong\n\nWill my prediction come true? I think so. However, there's a chance I could be wrong.\n\nAmazon's growth could be even better than I anticipate. The company could move into new markets more aggressively than before. It could out-innovate rivals, including those mentioned above.\n\nAny or all of the companies I expect to be bigger than Amazon 10 years from now could stumble. Apple's GenAI initiatives might not ignite an iPhone upgrade supercycle. Microsoft might be unable to capitalize on new AI developments from OpenAI for some reason (perhaps OpenAI stumbles or the two companies' relationship sours). Alphabet's Google Search dominance could disappear due to regulatory actions and/or new AI capabilities.\n\nStill, I wouldn't bet against Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet -- or Amazon either. Instead, I own all four stocks and don't plan on selling them.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we explore the 15 smartphone companies with the largest market share in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Smartphone Companies with the Largest Market Share in 2024.\n\nSmartphones have become essential in modern life, simplifying tasks, boosting productivity, and enhancing daily activities. They offer seamless connectivity through calls, texts, emails, and social media, and provide easy internet access for browsing, online shopping, and banking. A wide variety of apps cater to productivity, entertainment, education, and health. Additionally, smartphones feature GPS and mapping services for navigation, high-quality cameras for photography and video recording, and are portable for convenient use on the go. They combine the functions of a phone, camera, GPS, and music player into one device, offering access to vast information and educational resources, and tools for managing schedules, tasks, and remote work.\n\nSmartphone sales are poised for growth, particularly in emerging markets like India, Indonesia, and parts of Africa, where demand is increasing. The global rollout of 5G networks is prompting many consumers to upgrade their devices for faster internet and better connectivity. Different smartphone companies are also boosting their revenues by offering premium models with advanced features, which raises the average selling price and enhances profit margins.\n\nMoreover, smartphone companies are expanding their income streams beyond device sales by offering services such as app stores, cloud services, streaming, and accessories. Innovations like foldable screens, augmented reality, and improved cameras continue to draw in consumers. Strong ecosystems like Apple's iOS and Google's Android ensure high customer loyalty and repeat purchases. As the global economy recovers, rising consumer spending further drives demand for smartphones. These factors together suggest a promising growth path for the smartphone industry.\n\nIn Q2 2024, the global smartphone market grew by 8% compared to the same period last year, marking a strong recovery from earlier declines. This growth is driven by higher consumer demand and improved retail activity. A notable trend is the rise in sales of high-end smartphones. Premium devices, costing over $800, saw a 12% increase in shipments from the previous quarter, thanks to advancements in technology like better cameras and faster processors.\n\nEmerging markets are also contributing significantly to this growth. Shipments to regions such as India and Southeast Asia increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by a growing middle class and more widespread smartphone adoption. Major manufacturers are making significant investments in new technologies and forming strategic partnerships. This investment is part of a broader trend where the average selling price (ASP) of smartphones has risen by 5% from the previous quarter, reaching $345 in Q2 2024. Additionally, a 10% decrease in inventory levels indicates that supply and demand are becoming better balanced.\n\nStory continues 15 Smartphone Companies with the Largest Market Share in 2024\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the 15 smartphone companies with the largest market share in 2024, we analyzed the latest market research data from Canalys, International Data Corporation (IDC), and Counterpoint Research, focusing on smartphone sales in the first half of 2024.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Sold Half of His Apple Stock. 3 Reasons Not to Panic.",
        "content": "The news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) sold half of its Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock probably came as a shock to many investors. Although it often stood as the stock with the largest market cap in recent years, its growth played a significant role in the rise of Berkshire stock during that time.\n\nStill, from another perspective, the sale is probably not as monumental as it seems. Three key points illustrate why investors should not panic because of this move.\n\n1. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding\n\nDespite the size of the move, Berkshire Hathaway still owns approximately 400 million shares of Apple. At a value of roughly $84 billion, it made up about 29% of the Berkshire holdings at the end of the second quarter, far above Bank of America at 14%.\n\nAlso, even at a dramatically lower share count, Berkshire still holds a highly undiversified position in Apple stock. Buffett has long preached diversification, and last quarter's position of 789 million Apple shares meant that Apple made up a little less than half of the Berkshire portfolio.\n\nMoreover, the remaining position implies a continued belief in the company. Even though it faces a competitive battle with its mega-tech peers in the artificial intelligence space, its leadership in smartphones and the power of the iOS ecosystem makes it a tech leader.\n\nFurthermore, Apple boasts around $153 billion in liquidity, giving it one of the world's most stable balance sheets among publicly traded companies. That level of stability makes Berkshire's large position less risky, and with this recent sale, it is closer to having a diversified portfolio.\n\n2. Apple stock had become (relatively) expensive\n\nAdditionally, Buffett and his team may have become concerned about its valuation. Its P/E ratio of 32 is hardly in the stratosphere, but its valuation has risen significantly over the years, increasing the likelihood that it realized most of the multiple expansion that was going to occur.\n\nInvestors should remember that Berkshire acquired the majority of its Apple shares between the first quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2018. At the beginning of 2016, Apple often traded at 10 times earnings.\n\nIts P/E ratio increased steadily during that time. Still, it took until the third quarter of 2018 for the earnings multiple to rise above 20. Thus, Berkshire benefited from significant multiple expansion, resulting in an approximate 700% increase in the stock since Buffett's team began buying. Since the S&P 500 delivered a total return of just under 200% since that time, Apple has been a clear winner for Berkshire.\n\nStory continues AAPL Chart\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway's size means it needs the liquidity\n\nAnother reason for the sale may come with the difficulty of managing an investment company that is the size of Berkshire Hathaway. Its market cap now stands at about $890 billion as of the time of this writing.\n\nAlthough growing to that level is undoubtedly an impressive feat, it comes with a key struggle. Thanks to the law of large numbers, achieving just 10% growth means the market cap has to grow by $89 billion. That is just below the average market cap of an S&P 500 stock, which is $92 billion.\n\nIn comparison, that average company has to increase by just $9.2 billion to achieve the same growth rate. This also means that a $9.2 billion acquisition that would be significant for an average company barely moves the needle for Berkshire.\n\nThat brings one back to Berkshire's $271 billion liquidity position. While that may seem excessive, it likely needs that much cash to make meaningful acquisitions. Hence, its liquidity position may not be as eye-popping as many investors and analysts assume.\n\nMaking sense of Berkshire Hathaway's sale of Apple\n\nUltimately, investors should consider the sale of Apple stock as an inevitable move rather than a game-changer.\n\nYes, the sale is massive by just about any measure. Nonetheless, the 400 million share position is still a weighty vote of confidence in Apple's future, making up a highly undiversified percentage of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Also, Apple has become comparatively expensive, particularly when compared to the time it had begun to buy the stock.\n\nFinally, Berkshire's massive size means it needs a considerable liquidity position to make any meaningful moves. Hence, instead of viewing this sale as historic for Berkshire, investors should see the move as business as usual for the investment giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Gets Caught Up in Market Sell-Off. Is It Time to Buy the Dip in the Stock?",
        "content": "Despite delivering solid fiscal third-quarter results at the start of the month, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) got caught up in the recent market sell-off. This tech-driven sell-off was accelerated by a small interest rate hike in Japan and the unwinding of the carry trade.\n\nMarket corrections are unavoidable, and they can open up good buying opportunities. Let's look at Apple's most recent results to see if this is a stock investors should be scooping up on this market dip.\n\nServices revenue growth continues to lead the way\n\nAfter watching its revenue decline by 4% in fiscal Q2, Apple managed to increase it by 5% year-over-year, to $85.8 billion, for fiscal Q3, which ended June 29. That came in just above analyst expectations for revenue of $84.5 billion.\n\nEarnings per share grew 11% to $1.40, topping the $1.35 analyst consensus.\n\nRevenue for Apple's services segment, which includes its App Store and Apple TV, climbed 14% to $24.2 billion in the quarter. This segment carries much higher gross margins than the products segment, and its gross profits climbed 20% to $17.9 billion.\n\nProduct sales, meanwhile, rose nearly 2% to $61.6 billion, while gross profits edged up more than 1% to $21.8 billion.\n\niPhone sales declined by about 1% to $39.3 billion but came in slightly ahead of the $38.8 billion in sales that analysts had forecast. The company also said that sales rose on a constant-currency basis and that its installed iPhone user base hit \"a new all-time high.\"\n\niPad sales, meanwhile, saw a resurgence, climbing 24% to $7.2 billion on the back of the first new release of a tablet since 2022. The company said that about half of its iPad sales came from new users. Sales for wearables, home devices, and accessories -- the segment that includes the Apple Watch and AirPods -- rose 2% to $8.1 billion, while Mac sales rose 2% to $7 billion. About two-thirds of Apple Watch buyers and about half of MacBook Air buyers had never bought those items before.\n\nCheck out some numbers from the most recent quarter in the table below.\n\nSegment Revenue Increase  Revenue Gross Profit Increase Gross Profit Services 14% $24.2 billion 20% $17.9 billion Products 2% $61.6 billion 1% $21.8 billion iPhones 1% $39.3 billion Wearables 2% $8.1 billion iPads 24% $7.2 billion Mac 2% $7.0 billion Company Total 4% $85.8 billion 9% $39.7 billion\n\nData source: Apple.\n\nMainland China continued to be a weak spot, with Apple revenue in the country down about 6.5%. However, the company said that its iPhone installed base hit a record high, while it saw a record number of users upgrade their iPhones in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Apple forecast that its fiscal Q4 revenue would see growth similar to the 5% of fiscal Q3. It also expects double-digit services revenue growth, as in the prior three quarters. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIs now the time to buy Apple stock?\n\nApple's services businesses continue to shine with consistent midteens revenue growth. While iPhone sales remain lackluster, the company has been able to nicely grow profits due to the high-margin nature of its services offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, the nice jump in iPad sales shows the impact a big product upgrade could have on the rest of its hardware business, including iPhone sales. As Apple continues to make strides in artificial intelligence (AI) with its Apple Intelligence offering, the introduction of a more substantial AI-powered iPhone upgrade could certainly help power hardware sales. Over the past few years, the upgrade cycle has slowed, as upgrades to the smartphone have been more incremental and investors are looking forward to something that will reverse that trend.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, Apple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just above 28 based on fiscal 2025 analyst estimates. Before COVID locked down the economy, the stock generally traded at a much lower P/E. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nWhile Apple's prospects are looking up due to the potential for an iPhone upgrade combined with the strength in its services business, the stock's valuation remains lofty after the jump in P/E multiple without a corresponding jump in growth. If the stock's valuation were to rerate back down to pre-COVID P/E multiples, there would be a lot of downside in the price from current levels.\n\nGiven the sudden shakiness in the market combined with its current valuation, I would wait for more of a pullback in Apple shares before looking to buy or add to the stock. There are currently more attractively valued stocks among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to consider buying before Apple. Meanwhile, even longtime Apple shareholder Warren Buffett cut his large Apple stake nearly in half, taking some nice profits in the process.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple Says No to Nvidia GPUs. Is This the End for Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the best stocks to invest in since the start of 2023. Its climb centers around the massive demand for artificial intelligence (AI) computing power. A lot of this demand comes from big tech players, but one big tech company recently said no to Nvidia.\n\nAlthough Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was late to the artificial intelligence game, its product was highly anticipated. To many people's surprise, Apple didn't use Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) to create its AI model. Could this be a sign that Nvidia's GPU empire is starting to crack?\n\nGPUs have been the most popular option for training AI models\n\nNvidia's GPUs have become incredibly popular for running AI workloads. Nvidia's GPUs are best in class, and it has industry-leading software available to help squeeze out every bit of performance from the GPUs. This is important as these servers that run AI models contain thousands of GPUs. GPUs are a top choice for this kind of workload because they can perform many calculations in parallel, unlike central processing units (CPUs) found in PCs. They are also good at other tasks, like cryptocurrency mining, engineering simulations, and drug discovery.\n\nBut because they aren't purpose-built for AI calculations, there is likely a better way to process calculations. These chips exist and aren't made by any of Nvidia's traditional competitors.\n\nOne of these alternatives is Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU). Alphabet's TPU was designed specifically for these large AI computations but is limited in flexibility. If a workload is properly set up, TPUs blow Nvidia's GPUs' performance out of the water, but only for specific use cases.\n\nThis is the primary reason Apple selected Alphabet's TPUs to train its Apple Intelligence model. Does one of the largest players in the industry selecting purpose-built hardware rather than a broader one signify the end for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's investment thesis hinges on customers buying more GPUs\n\nPart of the reason some investors (like myself) are hesitant to buy into Nvidia's stock now is the extreme growth expectations built into the company. Anyone buying the stock now assumes that the demand for Nvidia's GPUs will continue to grow significantly. However, they don't consider the possibility that once developers are used to setting up their AI models in a particular way, they may choose to use purpose-built hardware like the TPU.\n\nThis could be a thesis-breaker for Nvidia, as Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to grow by 98% this year to $110 billion and by 36% next year to $151 billion. Should demand for its product drop, these projections could be in danger.\n\nStory continues NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt's not just Alphabet with its custom design, either. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) both have their own custom chips that are purpose-built for AI model training. Neither of these three companies sells these products directly to the consumer. Instead, if clients want to access them, they must rent them through one of their cloud computing offerings.\n\nThis is a better long-term business model than Nvidia's, as once Nvidia sells its GPU, the only revenue it will get is from customers deciding to upgrade or replace the unit after its service life is complete. Cloud computing companies buy hardware and then rent the power to clients on a recurring basis, extending the value they can get from one unit.\n\nStill, all three cloud giants' data centers are filled to the brim with Nvidia's GPUs, and they're all buying more. So, while there may be better ways to train AI models, many companies are still training on GPUs.\n\nTime will tell whether this trend reverses and more companies train AI models like Apple did or GPUs for broader use continue to dominate. But it's a great point to remember if you're considering investing in Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Stocks to Buy In a Stock Market Sell-Off",
        "content": "Equity markets took a significant plunge on Monday, Aug. 5. Of course, that's no reason for long-term investors to panic. We are still technically in a bull market, and whether or not equities continue to dip, the drop might create opportunities to pick up shares of great stocks from the discount bin. Which corporations should investors consider investing in while they are down?\n\nHere are two worthy candidates: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Visa(NYSE: V). Find out why these two companies will likely be long-term winners regardless of what the market does in the short run.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple's shares were down by about 5% on Monday. Though that doesn't sound like a lot, considering we are talking about a stock worth more than $3 trillion, that's tens of billions of dollars. Apple's performance has been somewhat volatile for much of the year. It did not perform well through the first five months due to several headwinds, including slow iPhone sales in China, disappointing financial results, an antitrust lawsuit, and its perceived failure to keep up with its tech peers in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nHowever, the company's shares have rebounded in the past couple of months, partly thanks to its AI-related announcements during its developers conference in early June. How will things evolve for the tech giant through the end of the year? No one knows for sure, and that's not a question of particular interest to long-term investors. The company's prospects, though, remain strong. That's what matters most. First, Apple's financial results have improved.\n\nIn its latest reporting period, the third quarter of its fiscal year 2024, ended on June 29, Apple's revenue grew by 5% year over year to $85.8 billion. Its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40 were up 11% compared to the year-ago period. Revenue from its high-margin services segment was up 14.1% year over year to $24.2 billion. Second, Apple showed that it isn't out of the AI race. The company's nifty new AI features -- which it dubbed Apple Intelligence -- will be available to iPhone users (starting with the 15 Pro) and several of its other devices.\n\nApple has never sought to be first to market. It has a knack for taking existing technologies and adding its own spin on them. This slow and steady strategy has served the company well. Third, Apple has more than 2.2 billion devices in its installed base, which provides significant long-term monetization opportunities. Apple benefits from strong competitive edges, including switching costs (it's not easy to leave its ecosystem), one of the strongest brands in the world, and the network effect within its app store since the more app developers it has, the more attractive it is for customers, and vice versa.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, though Apple might not grow as fast as it did in the last decade, it remains an excellent tech stock to buy and hold.\n\n2. Visa\n\nVisa also fell along with the broader market on Aug. 5, but that aligns with the company's performance throughout the year. Visa has failed to keep up with broader equities since 2024 kicked off; its shares are currently up by just 0.32% year to date. Visa performance was largely driven by lower-than-expected consumer activity, which led to weak financial results. However, this is nothing to panic about. Visa's payment network helps facilitate credit card transactions.\n\nIt earns a fee every time a consumer swipes a card bearing its logo. When consumer spending decreases, the stock will suffer. Despite this headwind, there remains significant whitespace for Visa to grow, as odd as that might sound at first. The company's business -- and branded credit cards -- might seem ubiquitous, but cash, check, and other forms of transactions it can eat up still account for a massive payment volume.\n\nThe company recently estimated a $20 trillion opportunity. How does that compare to its current ecosystem? During its fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023), the company's payments volume of $12.3 trillion increased 6% year over year. So, if Visa can make solid headway and capture a large share of this $20 trillion opportunity, its financial results should continue to improve. And there are excellent reasons to think it can do exactly that. Visa has no notable competitors other than Mastercard.\n\nThis duopoly is unlikely to be toppled anytime soon. The two companies benefit from a network effect. The more merchants within Visa's payment ecosystem, the more attractive it is to consumers. The reverse is also true. Yes, Visa will sometimes encounter issues like it has this year, and so will every company in existence. Considering the company's long-term prospects, though, Visa's performance this year represents an excellent opportunity to pick up its shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nearly 20,000 Intel Employees Are Heading For The Exits: How Salaries Stack Up Against Nvidia, OpenAI, Microsoft And More\n\nIntel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced plans to slash jobs in an effort to drive cost savings across its business.\n\nHere’s a look at just how much Intel was paying its employees and how it compares to other tech giants.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? This startup is on the brink of a huge disruption to the $654 billion industry – Here’s how to invest in it before it fulfills its 800 pre-orders in the next 2 weeks.\n\nWhat To Know: Intel and other big tech companies rarely share salary details. However, they must disclose salary offers or potential salary ranges when they hire foreign workers through the H-1B visa program.\n\nAccording to a Business Insider report citing work-visa applications submitted to the U.S. Office of Foreign Labor Certification in 2022, Intel’s highest salary offer was around $263,000, sent to an engineering manager.\n\nTrending:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nIntel announced a cost-reduction plan last week.\n\nThe actions include structural and operating realignment across the company. This includes headcount reductions of greater than 15% plus operating expenses and capital expenditure reductions of more than $10 billion in 2025. Intel’s headcount is currently around 125,000, so the company is likely to lay off around 19,000 employees.\n\nHere’s a look at the annual salary of those former Intel employees:\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analysts: $65,437 to $142,438 Information Security Analysts: $107,994 to $170,248 Supply Chain Planning Analysts: $85,467 to $96,034 Product Marketing Engineers: $102,606 to $150,093 Mechanical Engineers: $81,765 to $121,576 Engineering Managers: $117,624 to $263,952 Application Developers: $92,488 to $121,763 Program Managers: $67,621 to $168,834 Data Scientists: $65,229 to $152,681\n\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nWhy It Matters: When compared to other big tech companies, Intel appears to be offering prospective employees less money. It’s worth noting that the data doesn’t include stock-based compensation, individual performance rewards or bonuses that can significantly increase overall pay.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom to date, has offered salaries ranging from $74,460 to $786,000.\n\nSee Also:Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nFellow AI leader Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) made salary offers ranging from $77,000 to $310,000 in 2022 and Microsoft-backed OpenAI is paying the average engineer about $925,000 per year in total compensation.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) offered prospective workers base salaries of $102,000 to $322,000 in 2022 and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) offered workers salaries ranging from $55,000 to $340,000.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

        "title": "Calculating The Fair Value Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Apple is US$240 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$216 share price, Apple appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 2.1% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$235\n\nDoes the August share price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$123.7b US$134.9b US$163.8b US$177.5b US$188.0b US$197.2b US$205.5b US$213.0b US$220.1b US$226.8b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x10 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.92% Est @ 4.89% Est @ 4.18% Est @ 3.67% Est @ 3.32% Est @ 3.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.3k US$117.2k US$132.6k US$134.0k US$132.3k US$129.4k US$125.6k US$121.4k US$116.9k US$112.3k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$227b× (1 + 2.5%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.5%) = US$4.9t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.9t÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.4t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.6t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$216, the company appears about fair value at a 9.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.160. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

        "content": "As we advance further into the digital age, augmented reality (AR) continues to emerge as a pivotal technology reshaping numerous industries. The AR market is ripe for significant growth. Industry analysts predict a surge in demand for AR applications as both enterprises and consumers recognize its potential to enhance user experiences and operational efficiencies.\n\nThe AR market was valued at $57.26 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 39.8% until 2030. The growth is expected to be driven by increased adoption in sectors like gaming, media, and entertainment, as well as expanding applications in healthcare, logistics, and manufacturing.\n\nThe industry is still in its nascent stages, and investing in AR stocks can generate substantial returns for investors. Heading into August 2024, here are three AR stocks that stand out as top picks for those looking to invest in a technology that’s set to transform the digital landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity (NYSE:U) has been integrating augmented reality into its platform, enhancing its utility for developers creating immersive AR experiences. Through its Unity Engine, the company supports the development of AR games and applications, utilizing features like real-time 3D rendering and interactive content creation.\n\nThe company is not only enhancing its existing AR tools but also forging significant partnerships to expand its reach and application. A notable collaboration includes working with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to support the development of iOS AR apps, highlighting Unity’s commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements in AR.\n\nUnity’s stock price has continued to tumble in 2024, following a disappointing performance in recent quarters. However, the appointment of a new CEO, Matthew Bromberg, who was part of Electronic Arts, marks a strategic shift aiming to stabilize the company.\n\nThe company’s stock is currently trading at an attractive valuation, which provides a good entry point for investors with a long-term time horizon. The stock is trading at a forward P/E of 19x, which is lower than the sector median of 23x.\n\nPTC (PTC) Augmented reality, app showing map, calories and speed onto a lens.\n\nSource: Yuriy Golub / Shutterstock.com\n\nPTC (NASDAQ:PTC) is making significant strides in augmented reality as part of its digital transformation strategy for industrial sectors. PTC’s Vuforia platform is at the core of its AR operations, providing advanced tools that enable enterprises to create immersive AR experiences that enhance product design, manufacturing, and service processes.\n\nStory continues\n\nPTC reported its Q3 2024 earnings on July 31. The company posted an EPS of $0.98 for the quarter, beating expectations by $0.02. However, the revenue of $518 million was down 4.37% year-over-year (YoY). Despite a challenging macro environment, PTC maintained a solid pipeline and confirmed its commitment to strategic priorities and operational effectiveness.\n\nPTC’s strategy to maximize cross-selling opportunities, particularly with ServiceMax, is poised to drive future growth. The company’s financial performance remains strong, with notable increases in revenue and earnings, which makes it a compelling augmented reality stock to buy. Although the PTC is trading at a premium to the sector median, the company has continued to perform better than its peers and has better growth prospects to justify the higher valuation.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is widely recognized for its powerful suite of creative software, but its venture into augmented reality is setting the stage for the next era of digital innovation. With the launch of Adobe Aero, a user-friendly AR authoring tool, Adobe is making significant strides in integrating AR technology into the creative processes of designers and developers.\n\nMoreover, the company has also integrated AI across its software suites. The introduction of tools like Adobe Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant marks a significant enhancement in functionality, attracting both new users and encouraging existing customers to upgrade.\n\nThe financial impact of these integrations is noteworthy. Adobe’s recent earnings show a robust 10% YoY growth, with the Digital Media segment’s net new Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) touching $487 million. This growth is not just a testament to Adobe’s innovative edge but also to the market’s enthusiastic reception of cutting-edge digital tools.\n\nThe strategic partnerships and continuous improvements in its tools underscore Adobe’s commitment to maintaining its leadership in the creative software industry. By continuously evolving its AI offerings, Adobe not only retains its relevance but also enhances its appeal to a broader demographic, from individual creatives to large enterprises.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Warren Buffett Should Sell (Other Than Apple)",
        "content": "For many investors, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might have become the top name for WarrenBuffett stocks to sell.\n\nIt’s been about a week since Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) revealed that it sold approximately 390 million shares of Apple stock during the second quarter. That’s on top of the 115 million sold in the first quarter of 2024. That lowers Apple’s percentage of the Berkshire equity portfolio from over 40% to 28.3%. It also lowers Berkshire’s ownership stake to 2.3%.\n\nInterestingly, Berkshire’s cash received for selling these shares wasn’t immediately reinvested, so the equity portfolio has dropped to $300.2 billion from over $400 billion before the Apple trades were made public.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile Buffett wanted to reduce the company’s reliance on Apple stock, it still owns nearly 400 million shares. The next biggest contributor to its equity portfolio is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which accounts for 11.9%.\n\nThere are other Warren Buffett stocks to sell. Here are my three candidates from the 46 names held by Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is Berkshire’s sixth-largest holding, accounting for 5.0% of its equity portfolio. The holding company owns nearly 29% of the oil and gas producer. In addition to oil and gas, it has a large chemicals operation and a midstream and marketing business that purchases, markets, gathers, processes, transports and stores oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other energy sources.\n\nThe company’s shares have not done well in the past year, down more than 8%, considerably less than the nearly 18% gain of the S&P 500. Worse still, Berkshire’s fifth-largest holding is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). It owns almost $18 billion in CVX stock, good for 6.7% of Chevron’s stock, accounting for 5.9% of its equity portfolio, which has also been down a similar amount over the past year.\n\nIn the 2023 annual shareholder letter, Buffett argued why it owns OXY. While I understand the desire to own a big chunk of America’s energy resources, why own both companies?\n\nOf the two, Chevron is the superior long-term investment, with or without Oxy’s warrants.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the years, I’ve vacillated between being bullish and bearish on Berkshire’s investment in Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). They’ve barely moved over the past 12 months, up less than 2%.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, Kraft Heinz’s carrying value was $13.23 billion, $1.2 billion higher than its fair or market value as of Dec. 31. That means it hasn’t gotten a return yet from the original price paid for its stake in the maker of Heinz ketchup. On the plus side, it did receive $521 million in dividends from the company in 2023 and every year before that.\n\nStory continues\n\nEventually, dividends might pay for its investment because it doesn’t appear capital appreciation will do it. Over the past five years, KHC shares have gained 32.3%. Weirdly, that’s better than many of its competitors, including Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS). Still, I don’t think that’s a reason to hang on to a significant investment.\n\nKraft Heinz is Berkshire’s seventh-largest holding, accounting for 3.8% of its equity portfolio and representing a 26.9% stake.\n\nI can think of several companies worth owning nearly 30% of. KHC isn’t at the top of the list.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is Berkshire’s 20th-largest holding, valued at $1.81 billion, accounting for 0.6% of its equity portfolio. Visa (NYSE:V) is Berkshire’s 18th-largest position at 0.7%.\n\nIn June, I recommended Mastercard as one of three fintech stocks to own to ride the ongoing desire by investors and consumers for more fintech innovation. I like it.\n\nHowever, I don’t understand owning both companies’ stocks. While their businesses have slight differences, they are interchangeable proxies for the global fintech expansion.\n\nMastercard has outperformed Visa in 2024, the past 12 months, and over the past five years. I wouldn’t see a problem with Buffett selling Visa and keeping Mastercard. However, the holding company’s slightly higher investment in Visa suggests it’s somewhat more comfortable with Visa.\n\nI don’t think there’s an incredible need to own not one but two massive financial payment companies that have underperformed for most of the past decade.\n\nBut then again, I’m writing about stocks while Buffett has $300 billion to invest. He probably knows a thing or two that I don’t.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Intel is the latest Fortune 500 giant to test the ‘4 wrong CEOs’ rule",
        "content": "Sometimes a CEO’s most fateful decisions are apparent only years later. Example: If one decision had gone the other way, chipmaker Intel today might be on the leading edge of AI rather than struggling to regain its onetime industry leadership.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018 the company had a chance to buy a 15% stake in OpenAI for $1 billion, Reuters recently reported. If CEO Bob Swan had said yes, that investment would now be worth an estimated $12 billion, based on a February evaluation of OpenAI by venture capitalists and private investors. But Intel missed much more. It reportedly might have received an additional 15% in return for selling hardware to OpenAI at cost. With 30% ownership it could have been at the forefront of generative AI, which OpenAI released to the world in 2022. From the vantage point of 2017 and 2018, however, Swan judged the potential deal a loser. (Swan did not respond to Reuters’s request for comment.)\n\nThe episode recalls a similar decision, in 2006, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs asked Intel CEO Paul Otellini to make chips for a product that didn’t yet exist, which would be called the iPhone. Otellini said no. When he retired in 2013, he seemed to grasp the magnitude of his decision, telling an interviewer, “The world would have been a lot different if we’d done it.” (You can read the full story about the fallout from that decision here.)\n\nIntel now tests the longtime observation that a company can survive a wrong CEO, but no company can survive four consecutive wrong CEOs. After Intel’s great CEO Andy Grove stepped down in 1998, he was followed by four CEOs, including Swan and Otellini, who were arguably wrong for the job at that time. As performance deteriorated, the directors in 2021 brought in former Intel chief technology officer Pat Gelsinger as CEO to lead an ambitious high-stakes rescue mission. The outcome remains unclear; Intel’s stock price recently plunged 26% on poor quarterly results.\n\nThe Intel saga is a grim reminder that some of America’s greatest companies have succumbed to the four-wrong-CEOs disease. Consider Westinghouse, a jewel of American industry for 100 years. Four consecutive wrong CEOs from 1983 to 1993 damaged Westinghouse so grievously that the board brought in an outsider CEO who disassembled and re-created the company. An entity called Westinghouse remained, but the awesome institution was gone, and the new-look company has since disintegrated.\n\nEven more dramatic was the demise of Sears, the world’s largest retailer for decades. Four wrong CEOs from 1962 to 1986 led Sears onto a downward trajectory from which it couldn’t recover. Under the first of those CEOs, Sears’ market value reached its apex and began to decline, a reversal the top leaders explained away as a quirk of the economy. Under the fourth, Sears diversified heavily into financial services and demoted the retail business to a cash cow to be milked until it stopped. The financial services strategy failed and was unwound in 1992, but by then Walmart had surpassed Sears, which had lost its momentum forever. Investor Eddie Lampert bought the company in 2004 but couldn’t revive it. Sears once had 3,500 stores. Now it has 11.\n\nIt’s worth asking why corporate doom often takes four CEOs. Surely just one really terrible boss could do the job, right? Yes, but in companies of significant size, truly awful CEOs will probably be pushed out before they can destroy the whole thing. Ruining a substantial, successful business takes some doing, as explained by Jim Collins, author of multiple business mega-sellers (Built to Last, Good to Great, Great by Choice). In How the Mighty Fall, he identifies five stages of decline: hubris borne of success; undisciplined pursuit of more; denial of risk and peril; grasping for salvation; capitulation to irrelevance or death. Intellectually and emotionally, a single CEO would have a tough time going through all five stages, and a board could scarcely let one CEO take a company through all five.\n\nTo see how those stages play out, and why even three wrong CEOs might not be enough to wreck a company, examine Apple’s situation in 1997. The company was 20 years old. Three consecutive wrong CEOs had taken the company through the first three stages of decline. The company had been close to bankruptcy and was now in the fourth stage, grasping for salvation. A wrong fourth CEO would almost surely have taken Apple to the final stage. The board of directors, desperate, brought back co-founder Steve Jobs, who had been fired in 1985 and (believe it or not) had never been Apple’s CEO. The rest is history, but it could so easily have gone the other way.\n\nIt must be said that wrong CEOs are not dim-witted or evil. Most often they’re intelligent, highly accomplished, and motivated to succeed, but experience or temperament unsuited them for the job in that company at that time. Four of them in a row is as unlikely as four of a kind in poker, but in the corporate world it doesn’t happen by chance. Ultimately blame must fall on those fallible humans in the board room.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: These Will Be Warren Buffett's Top-5 Stocks in 2025",
        "content": "It doesn't take a Nostradamus to predict what Warren Buffett will have as his top position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio next year. I think it will almost certainly be cash, including cash equivalents and short-term investments in Treasury bills.\n\nBerkshire's cash stockpile totaled nearly $277 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024. Buffett would have a hard time spending enough of that money over the next 16 months for cash not to be Berkshire's top position at the end of next year.\n\nHowever, forecasting Buffett's top stock holdings isn't quite as easy. I have my ideas, though. I predict these will be the top-five stocks in Berkshire's portfolio in 2025.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has reigned as Berkshire's biggest holding for years. It's still No. 1 despite Buffett selling roughly half of his company's stake in Apple in recent months. I expect the stock will remain at the top in 2025.\n\nEven though Buffett has sold a significant chunk of Berkshire's position in Apple, there's no reason to believe he doesn't still like the stock and the company. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, he praised Apple's business.\n\n2. American Express\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) currently ranks as Berkshire's third-largest holding. It makes up 11.8% of the conglomerate's portfolio. I don't expect Buffett to buy additional shares of Amex, but I do think it will move up one spot.\n\nThere are two reasons behind my prediction about American Express. One is that I believe the stock will perform well over the next year or so (assuming there isn't a recession). What's the other reason? I'll discuss it next.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC) trails behind Apple as Buffett's second-biggest stock holding right now. But it isn't far ahead of American Express, with Berkshire's stake in BofA worth around $36 billion and its stake in Amex worth $35.4 billion.\n\nI think American Express may outperform Bank of America over the near term. More importantly, though, Buffett sold over $3.8 billion of the stock in Q2. I won't be surprised if his selling isn't finished.\n\n4. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) is Berkshire's fourth-largest stock holding now. I don't think that will change in 2025.\n\nCoke's share price could appreciate over the next 16 months. However, I wouldn't count on it soaring enough to leap into third place. And while Buffett loves the company and its stock, he hasn't bought any additional shares of Coke in years and likely won't do so anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\n5. Occidental Petroleum\n\nChevron is currently in the No. 5 spot in Berkshire's portfolio. But I expect another oil stock will replace it sometime next year: Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY).\n\nI'm not sure if Occidental will deliver greater gains than Chevron. The two stocks often move in tandem. However, I'd bet that Buffett adds to his position in Oxy. Berkshire owns 28.8% of Occidental now but secured regulatory approval to increase its stake to 50%.\n\nBest picks from these predicted top-five stocks\n\nI think all five stocks I predict will be in Buffett's top five in 2025 could be winners over the long term. However, two especially stand out to me.\n\nTo borrow a slogan from years ago, Coke is it -- for income investors, at least. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with a forward-dividend yield topping 2.8%.\n\nWhat's the best pick of the group for growth investors? I'd go with Apple. The company plans to soon launch its first generative AI functionality. Apple could enjoy a strong boost in sales if its new Apple Intelligence features entice consumers to upgrade their iPhones. My prediction is that they will.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Stock Will Be Warren Buffett's Top Performer by 2030",
        "content": "Everyone knows about Warren Buffett's monster Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) investment. The huge hundred-billion-dollar winner -- which Buffett recently trimmed -- is quoted time and time again as one of Berkshire Hathaway's best investments. However, the investment has been held for fewer than 10 years, while Buffett has been investing for more than 60.\n\nBuffett has bought and held American Express(NYSE: AXP) for many years longer than Apple. And yet few people discuss this huge winning investment. Even though the stock is up over tenfold since Buffett's initial purchase, shares still look cheap today. Here's why American Express is poised to crush the market again and can be Buffett's top performer through 2030.\n\nAmerican Express: One of Buffett's favorite brands\n\nAmerican Express operates one of the only credit card networks around the world. However, unlike other networks like Visa and Mastercard, American Express acts as the bank and actually issues its own credit cards. This vertically integrates digital payments, making American Express a unique business in the credit card world.\n\nCatering to wealthier clientele, the company has built a premium brand that has been honed for decades. It offers high-fee credit cards such as the American Express platinum card, which has an annual fee of $695 a year. People are willing to pay these fees for the large travel benefits, cash-back deals, and other perks of the American Express ecosystem. As a classic network effect, it would be virtually impossible to rip and replace American Express from the payments ecosystem, making it a wide-moat business.\n\nBuffett loves top brands such as American Express, Apple, and Coca-Cola. It is no surprise then to see Berkshire Hathaway still own over 20% of the business. It made its first investment back in 1991. Since then, American Express has posted a total return of close to 8,000%, which is better than Coca-Cola over that same time frame.\n\nGrowing card members, expanding international acceptance\n\nAround 10 years ago, American Express went through a rough patch. It struggled to gain new users and lost a huge contract for the Costco Wholesale credit card partnership.\n\nSince then, with new management at the helm, the company has set itself back on the right rack. Total cardmembers are growing again and have been for several years. Last quarter, the company added 3.3 million new cards, accelerating from a 3 million gain in the same quarter a year ago. New cards are the lifeblood of American Express' business, so it is great to see new customers joining the platform. Over the next decades, these customers should provide a ton of value to American Express' business as these wealthy customers make purchases with these cards and pay the high annual fees.\n\nTo keep up this growth, American Express is investing aggressively to grow the number of places that accept American Express card payments. This is the other lifeblood of the payments business. If a merchant doesn't accept your credit card as a form of payment, you don't make any money because shoppers can't use their cards to make the purchase. Since 2017, the company has grown its international accepting locations fourfold, which will drive even more payments growth in the coming years. It has virtual acceptance parity with Visa and Mastercard in the United States today. AXP PE Ratio Chart\n\nBuy this ultimate dividend grower and never sell\n\nThrough increased card fees, payment volume, international acceptance, and more credit card loans, American Express believes it can grow its revenue by 10% annually over the long term. Management thinks earnings per share (EPS) can grow even faster.\n\nThis growth -- if you agree with management -- will give American Express a ton of capacity to grow its dividend payments. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 1.23%, which looks quite low. But the stock is not wildly expensive and trades at a below-market price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17. Over the last 10 years, American Express' dividend per share has grown by 165%.\n\nIf revenue and earnings keep growing at 10% or more, I think that the stock can more than double its dividend per share again by 2030. Combined with a low starting valuation, I think American Express can be Buffett's top-performing stock from now until 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in American Express, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Weekly market recap: Here's how S&amp;P 500 sectors performed last week",
        "content": "US stocks concluded the week with a modest rebound, with the S&P 500 index rising by 0.5%, therefore marking the strongest consecutive daily gains of the year.\n\nThe rebound in stocks helped to offset much of the losses from earlier in the week, which began with a massive selloff, the most severe trading day since 2022.\n\nDespite the initial market turbulence and concerns about a potential economic downturn, recent corporate earnings reports have provided some insight into persistent trends, such as reduced consumer demand.\n\nThe week saw mixed performance across sectors, with consumer discretionary and materials sectors declining, while information technology and communication services outperformed the broader market.\n\nMaterials was the worst-performing sector (-1.7%) while Energy and Industrials both gained +1.2%.\n\nThe technology sector experienced mixed results, with semiconductor stocks slightly down. Notable losses were seen in shares of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc, while Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ:LRCX), and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) saw gains.\n\nThe software subsector, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase, bolstered by strong performances from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Inc. Tech hardware also advanced, led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP), and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ).\n\nIn the communication services sector, media and entertainment companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) contributed to a 1.0% sector gain. Telecommunication services also saw an uptick, with Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ), AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc reaching new heights.\n\nHealthcare stocks mirrored the broader market's performance. The pharmaceuticals subsector was a standout, with Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) shares surging after a blowout earnings report. However, the biotechnology and life sciences segments saw declines, with Gilead Sciences Inc (NASDAQ:GILD), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) facing setbacks.\n\nFinancials slightly outpaced the market, with advances in banks, insurance, and financial services. JPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), and American Express Co (NYSE:AXP) were among the top gainers, while Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) Inc saw declines.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector aligned with the market, with the automobiles and durables&apparel subsectors making modest gains. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) were among the notable climbers. The real estate sector saw gains in REITs, with Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG) and Welltower (NYSE:WELL) Inc reaching record highs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnergy stocks mostly rose following a jump in WTI crude oil prices, which were up 1% on the week. While the oil, gas, and consumable fuels subsector saw some gains, energy equipment and services faced a decline. Utilities also lagged behind the market, with electric utilities and multi-utilities experiencing mixed results.\n\nIndustrial stocks remained mostly unchanged, with transportation suffering losses and aerospace&defense gaining. The materials sector underperformed, with chemicals making slight gains, while construction materials, metals&mining, and containers&packaging faced declines.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat Trump 2.0 could mean for U.S. energy stocks\n\nHow to rebalance your portfolio to hedge against market risks\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(0:30) - Should You Be Following Warren Buffett’s Investing Trends? (3:45) - Breaking Down Berkshire Hathaway’s Recent Changes In Stock Positions (29:05) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, BAC, BRK.B Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #378 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nThere was big news in the last week for value investors. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) reported its second quarter results and revealed that it had sold a big chunk of its Apple (AAPL) shares during the quarter.\n\nAt the annual meeting, Warren Buffett had already disclosed that he sold $20 billion worth in the first quarter.\n\nBut, combined with the newly disclosed second quarter sales, Berkshire Hathaway has now sold 50% of its massive Apple stock position. This has shocked long-time Berkshire fans.\n\nThe money has apparently rotated into cash, as Berkshire’s cash hoard now has $277 billion, up from about $180 billion in the first quarter.\n\nAdditionally, SEC filings have indicated that Berkshire has sold over $3.8 billion in Bank of America (BAC) stock during the third quarter. Buffett has not sold any Bank of America stock in years.\n\nWhen Do You Sell? Never.\n\nBuffett’s folksy investment advice has included the phrase, “the best time to sell is never.” Some have meant this to mean you should never, ever sell a stock.\n\nYet over the years, he has, of course, sold some of his equity positions. And then some. When the pandemic hit, Buffett ordered the lieutenants, who owned several airline stocks, to sell out of them completely, even though it meant taking a loss.\n\nHe also sold out of a big IBM position, also for a loss. And recently, Berkshire Hathaway exited its position in RH.\n\nWhat Are Possible Lessons from Buffett’s Sales?\n\n1. Rebalancing\n\nBuffett has called Apple one of the four pillars of the Berkshire Hathaway business. Bought in 2016, he has sold some shares over the years when the position became too large for the portfolio. This “rebalancing” is typical in most portfolios, especially when you have such a big winner like Apple.\n\n2. Investing to Make Money\n\nApple has been one of Buffett’s greatest trades. I’m sure you have big trades like this as well. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t cash in on some of your profits. Remember, investors don’t have to sell out of their entire position. It is okay to take some profits off the table but leave shares to ride.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Has the Stock Gotten too Expensive?\n\nValuations could be a problem. Apple was cheap when Buffett bought it in 2016, trading under 10x forward earnings. Now, it’s trading at 32x with single digit earnings growth expected in fiscal 2024. Does one of your stocks now trade at sky-high valuations? It might be time to re-evaluate.\n\n4. Change at the Company\n\nThings change over the course of decades. Businesses and management changes. Is the company still in the business you want it to be in? Netflix used to send out DVDs in red envelopes in the mail. Now, it is exclusively a streaming service.\n\n5. Know Your Investing Goals\n\nWarren Buffett is managing the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for the Berkshire shareholders. For reasons we do not yet know, he believes he is better off being in cash instead of holding onto larger positions in Apple and Bank of America. Your investing goals will be different. It is okay to sell a stock when you reach your goal.\n\nWhat Else Should You Know About Buffett’s 2024 Stock Sales?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks haven't had it easy lately, but investors shouldn't toss in the towel on them during a volatile August for markets.\n\nBe precise with the picks right now given more challenging market conditions, said Wind Shift Capital founder Bill Blain.\n\nBlain — the longtime author of the Morning Porridge newsletter — tagged Meta (META) as the best Magnificent Seven play today.\n\n“The business of advertising is massive,” Blain told Yahoo Finance executive Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). “About 75% of advertising goes through the internet, and the firm that controls that best at the moment is [Meta].”\n\nMeta's second quarter earnings last week underscore Blain's bullish call.\n\nEarnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 73% from a year ago.\n\nIts app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) also walloped expectations with revenues of $38.72 billion. Sales for the app family rose about $7 billion year over year.\n\nMeta stock has rallied 7.5% since the company's Aug. 1 earnings report, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares are still off by 4% in the past month as sentiment has soured on the Magnificent Seven name.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven includes Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta.\n\nUnlike Meta, the other six names have dealt with various negative news in recent weeks that have pressured their shares.\n\nNvidia is reportedly delaying the shipment of its new Blackwell AI chips by a quarter. Tesla had a terrible second quarter. Alphabet preached of needing more time for AI adoption, while market leader Microsoft's AI results didn't live up to expectations. Amazon warned of a slowing consumer in its second quarter.\n\nAll of the non-Meta Magnificent Seven stocks are down since Meta's earnings report, led by a 13% drop in Tesla stock.\n\nThen there is Apple.\n\nBlain, who had been bullish on Apple, has recently shifted perspective.\n\n“When Warren Buffett turned around and dumped the stock, I thought, he must know something I don’t,” said Blain.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) reportedly slashed its stake in the tech giant by as much as 50%. It's unclear as to Buffett's motivation, but it sent a negative signal to an increasingly jittery market.

        "title": "Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum",
        "content": "While some tech companies are suffering a sell-off, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has fallen by 11% in the last 30 days, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has fallen by an even greater 16%, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has continued to advance and reached the $224 mark in the post-earnings period.\n\nThis new valuation level for Apple is justified by its responsibility for spreading artificial intelligence (or Apple Intelligence) technology through its strong user base and possible monetization from this, such as a better cycle for its hardware and maintaining the momentum of service revenue.\n\nApple maintaining this very premium valuation level is explained by its excellent earnings, which have highlighted a clearer scenario for the company.\n\nEarnings were pretty solid\n\nIn its third fiscal quarter, Apple delivered very strong indicators reinforcing its good prospects for the end of this fiscal year and the medium term. Net revenue was up 5%, driven by services and the resumption of growth in iPads and Macs. While the market expected revenue of around $84.40 billion, the reported figure was $85.50 billion. The tech giant also beat earnings per share projections, delivering $1.40 while estimates were $1.34.\n\nOverall, each key performance indicator surprised the market in a positive way. The company also recorded 24% year-over-year growth in iPad sales, 2% growth for Macs and the maintenance of very strong momentum for its services revenue. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nEven iPhone sales, which shrank by 1% but showed slight growth on a constant currency basis, show the continued strength and resilience of smartphones and confirm what was mentioned in the call that the iPhone 15 models continue to be chosen by consumers, with the Pro and Pro Max being able to use Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile only the newest iPhones will be able to make full use of Apple Intelligence features, Macs with Apple Silicon since 2020 will have these features.\n\nOnce again, the positive highlight was the services segment, which reached $24.20 billion and paid subscriptions reaching an all-time high. In addition, the advertising, cloud and payments subsegments achieved all-time highs due to significant operational advances in Apple TV, Apple Pay, Maps and other features.\n\nOn the negative side were results in China, which fell by 6.50% and just under 3% in constant currency. Even if the risk of a slowdown in sales and the exchange rate risk persists, it may not be as severe as the installed base in the region has reached a new record, which may be a sign that the environment remains competitive, but with a greater level of stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, management's expectation is that in the fourth quarter, revenue will grow at the same rate as in the third, which was close to 5%. In addition, they believe the gross margin will be between 45.50% and 46.50%, which is also close to what was recorded last quarter. This guidance was higher than expected by Wall Street.\n\nThe valuation is still reasonable\n\nIf we look only at momentum and the market's reaction to recent earnings, sentiment for Apple is bullish. Operationally, the company has returned to growth, continues to deliver good profitability indicators and its outlook for the AI narrative is excellent, with the main view being the company will offer (and possibly further popularize) these functionalities with its broad user base.\n\nAnd this is mainly revealed by the company's valuation. Apple's forward price-earnings ratio is 30, above its average of 26 over the last five years and very close to Microsoft, which trades at 31 times its net income. One of the things worth reflecting on is whether Apple really deserves the same award as Microsoft since its operations, although resilient and driven by services, still have a greater cyclicality, less recurrence and more timid growth prospects when compared to other big tech players.\n\nThis makes Apple's GF Value rank a low 3 out of 10, mainly due to multiples that exceed its own history and are in line with or slightly above the industry. Therefore, on the GF Value chart, Apple appears to be modestly overvalued, which makes a lot of sense in the current context. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nIn a discounted cash flow model using net income as a proxy, it can be seen that Apple shares really are not a bargain currently, but they are not extremely overvalued either. With very reasonable assumptions, such as average growth of 5% (Wall Street estimates), a net income margin of 27% (made possible by continued efficiency gains and a better mix between services and products) and terminal growth of 4% with a discount rate of 8%, we find a fair price of $193 for Apple, a downside of just over 10% that seems within the margin of error. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nSource: Alpha Spread\n\nDespite the very small margin of safety, the bright side is that as Apple is an excellent company. We are much more likely to see positive surprises than negative ones.\n\nIn other words, if Apple comes up with some new factor that boosts earnings (or the narrative that earnings are going up), this could continue to boost the stock.\n\nApple isn't that attractive anymore\n\nThe downside is that, in relative terms, Apple has lost some of its appeal due to the eroding margin of safety. When we think about increasing exposure to a particular stock, we must always consider the opportunity cost and other allocation possibilities.\n\nAs mentioned, while Apple shares rose post-earnings, Microsoft and Amazon experienced dips. This makes Amazon and Microsoft a much more rational buy at the moment based on the history of the last five years. Apple Defies Tech Sell-Off With Strong Earnings, AI Momentum\n\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\n\nApple does not lose value because of this, but it makes it less attractive in relative terms since Amazon and Microsoft also have great prospects, large moats and will have a large share and benefit from the AI trend. For fiscal 2024, the consensus expects earnings per share growth of 9.33% year over year for Apple, Microsoft growth of 11.70% (for 2025) and Amazon growth of just over 60%. In other words, while they are all good prospects, Microsoft and Amazon stand out with promises of faster growth.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI believe the third quarter was a tipping point for Apple. The company appears to have returned to growth (albeit below other big techs) and managed to catch up with its peers in the AI race, which makes the outlook for the medium and long term much better.\n\nThe downside is this comes with an expansion in multiples that greatly reduces the margin of safety. Even though the stock is not very overvalued, it makes it less attractive when compared to similar options from consolidated technology-related companies with large moats and exposure to the most important trends in the market such as the cloud and AI.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s sudden sale of a huge pile of Apple Inc. shares has come with a surprise silver lining for investors in the iPhone maker: Its influence in major stock indexes is set to be fully unleashed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants When Climate Funds Pay for Highway Expansion\n\nApple’s weighting in a slew of benchmarks has been depressed for years because Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. tends to hold its investments for the long run, making them unavailable for trading. As a result, index providers calculated the tech company’s weight based on a methodology known as float-adjusted market capitalization.\n\nPut simply, Apple’s true value is not reflected in many indexes.\n\nIn percentage terms, the numbers don’t seem huge — in the case of the S&P 500, for instance, 94% of Apple’s value is currently considered. That should now increase to 100%, according to Piper Sandler & Co. But in a $3 trillion company, it adds up.\n\nIn the wake of Berkshire’s sale, passive funds tracking these indexes may now have to buy as much as $40 billion of Apple stock when they next rebalance, according to Piper Sandler’s estimates. That’s triple the average daily trading volume of the company’s shares over the past month.\n\nIndex funds robotically stepping-in to replace another investor in one of the megacaps will offer ammunition to critics like David Einhorn, who argue passive investing has “fundamentally broken” the markets by making so much money value-insensitive. More immediately, it’s bad news for some other companies in the gauges, whose weights will be reduced to accommodate the change and whose shares will be sold by funds accordingly.\n\nThe first revisions won’t take place until the quarterly index rebalance due next month, and for now at least any shuffling looks secondary for a market that’s fixated on economic growth and central bank policies. But there is a cohort of traders who take positions in anticipation of events like this.\n\n“We often see activity due to rebalances on our desk,” said Michael Kantrowitz, Piper Sandler’s chief investment strategist. “People want to be aware of it.”\n\nA spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices referred Bloomberg News to its index methodology and declined to comment further.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Is Warren Buffett Bearish Or Waiting To Pounce? Berkshire Now Owns More T-Bills Than Federal Reserve, Several Countries\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) surprised many observers by offloading a significant portion of Berkshire's Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings in the second quarter.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's balance sheet is now substantially weighted to United States treasury bills.\n\nTrending: This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nThe Data: According to Berkshire's most recent filing, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company now owns $234 billion in treasury bills.\n\nThat's more than the Federal Reserve's $195 billion treasury bill war chest. The U.S. central bank has gradually wound down its balance sheet in recent years.\n\nIt is also more than several countries, including Brazil, Germany and Mexico.\n\nBerkshire held $97 billion in treasury bills a year ago, still a mighty sum but less than half of today's mark. Its stock has appreciated over 20% since then.\n\nCheck It Out: Private credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class. Get up to $500 – just for making your first investment.\n\nWhat's Next: Buffett's strategy with his large cash pile is unclear.\n\nBuffett could be wary of Apple's prospects amid a sea of significant regulatory hurdles. Its future use of artificial intelligence is still unclear. Berkshire's Apple position is still its largest holding, but down over 50% since the end of 2023.\n\nOn a larger scale, Buffett could be bearish on the U.S. economy. Recession fears have intensified and the market has undergone a significant pullback since the beginning of summer.\n\nAlternatively, Buffett could simply be holding cash to forestall a large, future acquisition. The Omaha native has long championed taking advantage of market dips with large investments. Many of his acquisitions come as surprises to the market.\n\nRegardless, the nonagenarian is taking advantage of the high interest rate environment — over 5% — and delivering operating profit growth to shareholders.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Dump After Disappointing Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "The trade in technology stocks is getting more difficult. The mega-cap tech names known collectively as the “Magnificent Seven” lost a combined $1 trillion of value amid the global market rout that occurred on August 5. Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) lost $168 billion in market capitalization as its stock fell 6.4%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended down 4.8% and 4.1% respectively on the day. As you can see, market volatility is impacting even the biggest names, helping identify the top tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nHowever, the declines are more broad-based, with many technology stocks suffering losses since the beginning of July when investors began rotating money out of tech names and into value and small-cap securities. That rotation has only worsened amid rising fears that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession and as many well-known technology companies report poor second-quarter financial results.\n\nIt’s a big reversal from this year’s first half when technology stocks led the market rally as investors bet on the hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Here are three tech stocks to sell after earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot even a 10-for-1 stock split could paper over Super Micro Computer’s (NASDAQ:SMCI) horrible second-quarter financial results. SMCI stock is down 18% in the last five days, as the company reported EPS of $6.25, missing Wall Street’s target of $8.07. Revenue totaled $5.31 billion, which was only marginally better than the $5.30 billion that was forecast.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Super Micro Computer said that its gross margin dropped to 11.2% in Q2 from 17% a year earlier. A lower margin means the company is earning less profit on each product it sells. The company’s forward guidance was nothing to write home about either. A Q3 earnings outlook of a $7.48 midpoint fell below consensus estimates of $7.58.\n\nAs for the stock split, it’s due to occur on October 1. But with the stock down 60% from its 52-week high and trading under $500 a share, is a split even needed? SMCI stock has fallen 45% since the start of July, making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlmost as bad as the Q2 print delivered by Super Micro Computer was the one from Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). Shares of the company plunged 15% after management reported Q2 earnings that missed Wall Street’s target. Airbnb reported EPS of 86 cents, which was below the consensus forecast among analysts of 92 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nRevenue of $2.75 billion slightly beat estimates of $2.74 billion, and sales were up 11% from a year earlier. However, the outlook provided on the earnings call sunk the stock. Specifically, management warned that it anticipates some moderation in its year-over-year bookings during the current third quarter. They cautioned that they are seeing “…some signs of slowing demand from U.S. guests.”\n\nInvestors are carefully watching for signs that consumers are pulling back on spending amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing and might be headed for a recession. ABNB stock is down 22% in the last 12 months.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) reported great financials for Q1 when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were at an all-time high. But that was then, this is now. For the second quarter, Coinbase announced decidedly mixed financial results amid a slump in cryptocurrency prices and trading demand. Specifically, Coinbase posted EPS of 14 cents, which badly missed Wall Street consensus targets of 94 cents.\n\nRevenue of $1.45 billion did exceed the average analyst estimate of $1.37 billion. However, sales in Q2 were down 27% from the previous quarter. The company said that its results suffered due to a decline in trading volumes and losses on its crypto assets. Management said trading activity on its exchange has been subdued with crypto prices slumping and range bound over the past few months. COIN stock has fallen 20% since its Q2 print was made public making it a tech stock to sell after earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "The 3 Best Financial Services Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "It may not be the most exciting sector in which to invest, compared to tech and biotech. However, the best financial services stocks can offer a layer of stability to an investor’s portfolio like no other. But why?\n\nFirst, the industry itself is a multiplier of money. Firms compete for the best opportunities to expand investments while using cash to leverage future growth.\n\nMoreover, the financial services industry is deeply reliant on broader economic trends to remain solvent. Thus, with a global economic slowdown and a recession of some kind in the U.S. may be on the horizon. Thus, choosing the correct stocks in the sector is key to maximizing profits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo find them, investors should focus on the strategic moves made by financial services companies. They continuously provide both benefits to customers and returns to shareholders. So, let’s break down three of the best financial services stocks to watch as the industry navigates the aforementioned economic challenges.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the cost of living soars across developed countries, credit card companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP) will become increasingly central to consumer’s lives. After all, the chance to stretch finances provided by credit cards makes living month to month somewhat easier for some.\n\nTo capitalize even further on its relationships with vendors and customers, AXP is continuing to expand the offerings of its digital advertising platform. Through sharing consumer data with advertisers and vendors, the company aims to develop a niche for personalized ads directly to AXP card users. This comes as the company reports that “52% of Amex Offers redeemers in the U.S. were GenZ or Millennial Card Members. Amex Offers drove $9.8 billion in spend to U.S. merchants who ran on the Amex Offers platform.”\n\nAs the company continues to leverage its customer base for new ways to make money, investors in AXP stock will surely be rewarded.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nIn the days leading up to Monday’s market rout, Warren Buffett sold half of all of Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) holdings in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and some of its stock in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to sequester away $75.5 billion in stock for the period, resulting in a total of $276.9 billion in cash reserves for the asset management giant.\n\nFor investors, this hints that Buffett may be uncomfortable with the current economic picture in the U.S. May he be preparing for a buying opportunity if and/or when the market crashes? Also, it highlights strategic thinking that has made Berkshire Hathaway such a valuable stock over the years. And under Buffett’s management, protecting portfolio stability and trajectory over time is key.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, buying shares of BRK-B could be exceptionally lucrative in the long-term, as long as Buffett is calling the protectionary shots to keep shareholders safe.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMuch like American Express, Visa (NYSE:V) has much to gain from a financially constricted consumer base in the U.S. As a provider of credit cards, Visa makes all of its money from the usage of those cards through assessment fees.\n\nConsidering that Americans continue to rely on credit cards to make ends meet, the company will continue to see growth in revenue from assessment fees. Furthermore, with 60% of adults using credit cards to buy groceries in 2023, the reality of America’s reliance on Visa’s products only continues to expand.\n\nThough it may be a bleak reason to invest in Visa, it’s important to remember the company does not service or own any of the debt created by its cards. Thus, it’s not on the hook for the $1.14 trillion in consumer credit card debt in the U.S. This means its profits and business model are relatively risk-free, as it doesn’t need interest and principal payments to generate revenue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Why You Should Hold Off On ARM Stock Despite The Discount",
        "content": "For many investors, the conversation around the semiconductor industry isn’t always the clearest. Some companies are fabricators, others are designers, and then there’s Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) which is a designer for designers, which puts ARM stock in an interesting position.\n\nThat’s because Arm sells the chipset instructions for some of the most sought-after designs for processors that go into devices that need to be energy efficient like cellphones, tablets and laptops. This has resulted in a set of market conditions that have caused ARM stock to soar over the last year.\n\nUntil recently, ARM’s main competitor, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) held a strong position in the processor market thanks to the ubiquity of its x86 chipset design.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis format of processing instructions kept Intel’s chips ahead in processing power despite their power-hungry operation.\n\nYet, with Intel now struggling to survive its generational struggle for its reputation as its 13th and 14th generations of chips experience catastrophic microcode failures, the door for Arm’s dominance has never been more open.\n\nARM vs x86\n\nCurrently, ARM’s stock is soaring on its design integration into major tech company’s products like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), who all rely on the company’s power-efficient processors to enable the power of the MacBook and Snapdragon products they sell.\n\nFor a long time, Apple in particular relied on Intel’s processors for its computers, but with the introduction of the M1 chip, which runs on ARM architecture, the company has become an independent designer of the chips its computers rely on.\n\nNowadays, Intel’s lack of innovation for more power-efficient chips has relegated its products to high-powered personal computers rather than phones and laptops, which have become far more consistent revenue drivers than the former.\n\nMoreover, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announcing a new line of artificial intelligence laptops running on ARM architecture, Windows OS will receive a long-awaited version that is compatible with the ARM architecture as the software was previously designed around Intel’s x86 exclusively.\n\nThe Financial Story\n\nARM stock price has been on the decline recently despite relatively strong revenue growth in its most recent earnings report.\n\nPart of this can be attributed to the company’s guidance staying the same with the predicted decline in royalty income. Even with the recent decline, the stock is up nearly 56% this year.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025 which it reported back in June, ARM’s revenue grew 39% year over year to $939 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis surpassed its previous revenue guidance of $875 million to $925 million. The company also successfully surpassed forecasted adjusted EPS by 67%.\n\nAs a result, the company remains financially healthy and has the necessary momentum to grow into the opportunity currently forming in the semiconductor design market.\n\nYet, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 272x, the stock is still genuinely expensive. Thus, the question becomes, is ARM stock a buy after its recent dip, or should investors hold off on what could be a potential overvaluation?\n\nTo Buy or To Hold ARM Stock?\n\nAt its current price of $107, ARM stock might seem cheap compared to its recent all-time high of $188.75, yet the potential for overvaluation is high.\n\nWith all of the hype currently surrounding the tech industry and the broader potential for another selloff like the one that occurred this Monday, ARM stock could be risky to buy into right now.\n\nLooking at the stock’s first support level of around $100, the stock could dip further before its next earnings report, meaning it’s currently in a selling phase. Thus, investors may want to wait for the stock to get cheaper and for its P/E ratio to contract a bit before buying in.\n\nUltimately, ARM likely has a bright future ahead of it, but with the broader market instability and profit-taking behaviors in preparation for more volatility, ARM stock is a hold.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) and positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "The 3 Best Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "Volatility in the markets has heightened in recent weeks. However, long-term investors should embrace it since it creates bargains. Whether the low on August 5 was the bottom remains to be seen. Still, with most individual stocks down over 10%, it’s time to screen for the best blue-chip stocks whose risk-reward setup has improved.\n\nThere are several reasons to remain optimistic about stocks despite the recent selloff. Evidence points to earnings holding up, especially for blue-chip stocks. As of August 2, FactSet reported that 78% of S&P 500 stocks had reported a positive EPS surprise. That’s a big boost since stock prices follow EPS over the long term.\n\nThe blue-chip stocks discussed below have reported impressive earnings and issued a rosy outlook. Moreover, they generate tremendous cash flow and provide solid returns to shareholders. After their recent pullbacks, these are the best blue-chip stocks to buy, considering their expectations of accelerating revenues over the next year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter reporting declining revenue growth in five out of six quarters, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) turned the corner, delivering 5% revenue growth in Q3 fiscal year 2024. However, the strong report was overshadowed by news that Warren Buffet reduced his holdings in the technology giant by about 50%.\n\nStill, there are several reasons to be optimistic about Apple. First, Q3 FY2024 results highlighted improving fundamentals across its iPhone, iPad and wearable products. The earnings also revealed that its services business is becoming a juggernaut. In the quarter, segment revenues hit a record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year.\n\nEven better, the company issued upbeat guidance. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri noted that he expects Q4 FY2024 revenues to grow YOY like the June quarter. Moreover, Apple remains one of the best blue-chip stocks due to its robust balance sheet and share purchases. It ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and returned $32 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn the future, the biggest catalyst for AAPL stock is the potential for a significant iPhone upgrade cycle due to Apple Intelligence. The rollout has already begun with developers, and management expects a substantial enhancement of application capabilities. With the upcoming upgrade cycle, it’s time to step in and buy Apple on this pullback.\n\nLam Research (LRCX) The logo for Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) displayed on a white billboard\n\nLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a leading etch and deposition equipment provider. Following an over 30% correction since July 10, you can buy one of the best blue-chip stocks at a bargain price. As of this writing, LRCX stock trades at 21 times forward earnings and yields 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s Q4 FY2024 results, released on July 31, highlighted the continued momentum across its business lines. Revenues increased from $3.2 billion in Q4 FY2023 to $3.87 billion, a 21% year-over-year and 2.1% sequential increase. Moreover, EPS also grew sequentially from $7.34 in Q3 2024 to $7.78, demonstrating the acceleration in earnings.\n\nThese impressive results lay the groundwork for more gains ahead. Management sees a positive environment for expanding wafer fab equipment spending in FY2025. CEO Timothy Archer noted that inferencing at the etch will accelerate content growth of low-power DRAM and NAND storage in smartphones and enterprise PCs. As a result, AI-enabled devices will spur demand for Lam’s equipment.\n\nAs the AI thesis plays out, Lam Research continues its shareholder returns, spending $382 million in buybacks and $261 million in dividends in Q4 FY2024. Additionally, the Board approved a $10 billion share repurchase authorization. These shareholder returns and the growth prospects from AI make LRCX stock one of the best blue-chip stocks.\n\nEaton (ETN) An Eaton (ETN) sign on a company building.\n\nSource: Lukassek / Shutterstock.com\n\nEaton (NYSE:ETN) has been one of the best blue-chip stocks to own in the industrial sector. Year-to-date, it’s up 15% compared to a 7% gain in the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLI). After another beat and raise quarter, this stock has more upside.\n\nIndeed, Eaton has been riding major megatrends such as electrification, digitalization, infrastructure spending and the energy transition. As a result, it has seen surging orders from end markets such as data centers, industrial, residential buildings and utilities. Management noted that 444 megaprojects with a cumulative value of $1.4 trillion have been announced in North America since January 2021.\n\nAs a result, Eaton is seeing tremendous growth aided by a 41% win rate in these projects. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Q2 2024 sales grew 8% YOY to $6.35 billion. Even better, segment margins increased by 210 basis points to a record 23.7%. As a result, adjusted EPS grew 24% YOY, surging to a quarterly record of $2.73.\n\nIn terms of outlook, management expects solid growth in several end markets. For instance, they predict strong double-digit growth in data centers, commercial aerospace and utilities. That’s why they raised guidance, updating FY2024 organic revenue growth to 8-9% and increasing adjusted EPS expectations to $10.65 – $10.75. With earnings expectations going higher, Eaton is a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 5.3% to briefly top $62,000, extending gains from Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome traders think the quick reversal suggests that the recent price dip might have been a bear trap. “What an insane weekly.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy During the Stock Market Sell-Off Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "One of Warren Buffett's most famous quotes is that investors should \"be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.\" That's good advice to remember these days.\n\nA lot of investors are fearful, with stocks falling sharply in recent days. If you believe Buffett, though, this could present a tremendous buying opportunity. You can find great investing ideas simply by looking at Buffett's own Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Here are three Buffett stocks to buy during the stock market sell-off without any hesitation.\n\n1. Apple\n\nYes, Buffett recently sold a huge chunk of Berkshire's Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stake. He's obviously not being greedy with the stock right now, so why should other investors be?\n\nApple could be on the threshold of a multiyear iPhone upgrade supercycle. Many iPhone users are holding onto their older phones longer, which has hurt Apple's iPhone sales growth. However, Apple's revenue would surge if consumers were given a good reason to upgrade.\n\nSuch a reason appears to be at hand. Apple plans to soon roll out the initial Apple Intelligence functionality. This is the company's first generative AI launch -- and the features will only work on newer iPhones (the iPhone 15 Pro and later).\n\nApple's generative AI capabilities won't just boost iPhone sales -- they could also drive the company's services revenue higher (for example, in the App Store and other parts of the iPhone ecosystem). Some analysts predict that Apple could charge subscriptions for some Apple Intelligence features and give the company a new revenue source.\n\n2. Chubb\n\nBuffett began secretly buying shares of Chubb(NYSE: CB) last year. Berkshire now owns 6.4% of the property and casualty insurer, with a take worth close to $6.9 billion. I think Chubb is a great stock to buy during this stock market turmoil for three key reasons.\n\nFirst, Chubb performs pretty well, even when the stock market is choppy. For example, its shares have slipped only 3% during the recent sell-off. That's largely a testament to the company's stable business.\n\nSecond, the stock is cheap in an overall market that's valued at a premium. Chubb's forward price-to-earnings ratio is only around 12.3, compared to the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple of nearly 22.2.\n\nThird, don't be surprised if Buffett buys more Chubb -- and perhaps even the whole company. Chubb is a great fit with Berkshire's other insurance businesses.\n\nThe aforementioned sale of Apple stock gives Berkshire a massive cash stockpile it could use to fund an acquisition of Chubb and still have a lot of money left over. Even if Buffett doesn't opt to gobble up Chubb entirely, additional buying could make the stock attractive to other investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Lennar\n\nLennar(NYSE: LEN) is only a tiny holding for Buffett. Berkshire's stake in the homebuilder is worth around $23.6 million, which amounts to pocket change for the huge conglomerate. But Lennar is one of the best stocks in Buffett's portfolio to buy right now, in my view, because of something big on the way.\n\nI'm referring to the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The disappointing July numbers that served as one of the catalysts for the recent stock market sell-off make a rate cut even more likely.\n\nAs one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., Lennar should be a key beneficiary if the Fed cuts rates. Granted, mortgage rates don't always fall in lockstep with short-term interest rates but usually move in tandem. A decline in mortgage rates would almost certainly lead to higher new home sales, which should help Lennar.\n\nWhatever actions the Fed takes, the long-term thesis for buying Lennar is solid. The U.S. continues to face a housing shortage. More homes are needed -- and Lennar builds both single-family homes and multi-family rental properties.\n\nValuation is another big argument for buying Lennar stock. Its shares trade at only 10.6 times forward earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $606,079!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 9, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL and HP HPQ.\n\n2 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Computer Industry\n\nIndustry: Computer – Micro Computers\n\nLink to article: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2319190/2-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-computer-industry\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple and HP are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.  However, industry participants are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption RemainsHealthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. Canalys expects AI-enabled PC shipments to reach 48 million in 2024, representing 18% of total PC shipments. AI-capable PC shipments are projected to surpass 100 million in 2025, which will represent 40% of all PC shipments. This offers significant growth opportunities for industry participants.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospect\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #55, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Feb 29, 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2024 earnings has moved up 2.4%.\n\nGiven the bright outlook, there are many stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\n\nThe industry has gained 7.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s return of 10.1% and the broader sector’s growth of 11.6%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 28X compared with the S&P 500’s 20.19X and the sector’s 24.64X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.27X and as low as 15.54X, with the median being 24.72X.\n\n2 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now\n\nApple: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store’s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has increased by 1.4% to $6.68 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 9% in the year-to-date period.\n\nHP: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s sustained focus on launching the latest and innovative products is likely to help it stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n\nProduct innovation and differentiations are the key drivers that have helped HPQ maintain its leading position in the PC and printer markets. The growing interest in AI-enabled PCs is expected to give a fresh boost to HP’s PC demand.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $3.45 per share over the past 30 days. HP shares have gained 6.4% year to date.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese owner of TikTok, is preparing to refinance a $5 billion loan by another three years, people familiar with the matter said, in what would be one of the largest such deals for the country’s borrowers this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow a Tiny Midwestern Town Became a Mecca for Modern Architecture Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\n\nDiscussions with banks are underway, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter.\n\nByteDance secured a total of $5 billion in 2021 via a term and revolver facility each of half that amount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company was taking advantage of low interest rates and would use funds mostly to repay debt while replenishing its cash reserves for daily operations, Bloomberg reported at that time.\n\nA ByteDance spokesperson declined to comment in a message.\n\nFounded in 2012, ByteDance has quickly grown to become one of the leading social media platforms in China with the widely-used mobile video application Douyin. It’s also the Beijing-based parent company of TikTok, the social-media app popular in the US and which has become one of the flashpoints between the two countries in recent years.\n\nByteDance is looking to expand beyond its core business of online advertising into areas like e-commerce and generative AI. At home, it’s among a slew of local big-tech firms that sunk billions of dollars into research and development of large language models and ChatGPT-style apps. Abroad, TikTok is planning to roll out its niche live shopping platform in more European markets, after initial success in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "20 Most Industrialized Countries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 most industrialized countries in Asia. You can skip our detailed discussion and see the 5 Most Industrialized Countries in Asia here.\n\nCurrent State of Development and Outlook of Asia\n\nAsia has observed phenomenal growth in industrialization and manufacturing, particularly in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong domestic demand and export growth in electronics. Developing Asia's growth forecast for 2024 is revised up to 5.0% which also speaks volumes about the highly stable performances across multiple sectors. Countries like China, with its recovery in services consumption and strong exports, have played a key role in this growth. Moreover, the strong performance of sectors like construction and public investment in countries like Azerbaijan and the Kyrgyz Republic has further fueled this expansion.\n\nThe region’s inflation is also on a positive trajectory and is forecasted to ease from 3.3% in 2023 to 2.9% in 2024 and will stabilize at 3.0% in 2025. This decline is attributed to stable exchange rates and tight monetary policies in key economies. For example, Kazakhstan's inflation rate slowed from 18.5% in early 2023 to 9.0% in the same period of 2024. Similarly, Armenia experienced a 0.8% deflation in early 2024. Despite the positive outlook, the region faces several downside risks, including geopolitical tensions and property market fragility in China.\n\nSpeaking of China, it is worth highlighting that it is Asia’s most powerful economy in 2024. Beyond Asia, South Africa and Morocco are the most industrialized countries in Africa.\n\nSEE ALSO 15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024\n\nPerformance of Manufacturing in Asia in 2024 and the Growing Importance of South Asia\n\nAsia's manufacturing sector continues to exhibit strong performance as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) exceeded 50 for seven consecutive months. This consistent growth confirms a resilient industrial base across the region. For instance, China's PMI for June stood at 51.2, while Japan's reached 52.4. Moreover, Southeast Asian economies are also contributing largely to this growth. Vietnam's PMI hit 53.1 and similarly, Thailand and Indonesia reported PMIs of 52.7 and 51.8, respectively. The region's manufacturers are capitalizing on technological advancements and increased foreign investment.\n\nSoutheast Asia has become a key hub for businesses diversifying supply chains which is truly driven by the \"China Plus One\" strategy. With the growing US-China tensions, companies are shifting operations to the region to mitigate risks associated with heavy reliance on China. This strategy has largely boosted foreign direct investment (FDI) into ASEAN countries, with FDI rising to $236 billion in 2023, up from an annual average of $190 billion between 2020 and 2022. Countries like Vietnam and Indonesia are benefiting the most from this shift.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, Vietnam has appeared as an integral manufacturing location, especially for tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which now assembles MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches in the country. Vietnam's competitive labor costs and extensive free-trade agreements have made it a preferred destination for supply chains. In addition to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung has established a major research and development presence in Vietnam.\n\nMoreover, Malaysia and Indonesia are also seeing tremendous growth. Malaysia, with its skilled labour force in semiconductor manufacturing, has attracted investments from companies like Intel and GlobalFoundries. Meanwhile, Indonesia is capitalizing on its abundant resources of copper, nickel, cobalt, and bauxite to develop an integrated electric vehicle (EV) hub.\n\nTech Industry Giants Tapping Into Asian Economies\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expanding its presence in Asia with major investments in Indonesia and Singapore. In April 2024, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced plans to build a $200 million artificial intelligence center in Surakarta, Indonesia in partnership with Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison. This facility aims to enhance local telecommunications infrastructure and develop digital talent. The initiative follows Indosat's integration of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) next-generation chip architecture, Blackwell.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s partnership with Singapore's telecom provider Singtel further confirms its regional ambitions. By deploying AI capabilities in data centers across the region, Singtel aims to provide businesses access to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s cutting-edge AI computing power without the need for heavy infrastructure investments. Southeast Asia has indeed emerged as a major revenue driver for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOn the other hand, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) is making a strategic investment to automate chip packaging with the involvement of 14 Japanese companies, as reported by Nikkei Asia. Led by Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) Japan president Kunimasa Suzuki, this collaboration aims to develop a working prototype by 2028. The US chipmaker plans to invest tens of billions of yen in this initiative by capitalizing on Japan’s substantial 30% share in global chipmaking equipment. By advancing front-end processes like circuit formation, Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) seeks to enhance back-end applications, such as chip stacking, to boost overall chip performance. This decision is made to reduce reliance on manual assembly in low-cost regions and shift manufacturing to the US and Japan. The effort is timely, as China currently holds over a third of global back-end chipmaking capacity.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAlso, see Top 18 Automotive Industry Innovations and Trends and 20 Largest Publicly Traded Industrial Companies In The US. 20 Most Industrialized Countries in Asia\n\nA busy cityscape of financial buildings, emphasizing the importance of the industry for the economy.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the most industrialized countries in Asia, we used two key metrics: the value-added manufacturing output (in current dollars) and employment in industry (percentage of total employment). We chose the value-added manufacturing metric as it measures the contribution of manufacturing to the overall economy, and a higher value indicates a stronger and more developed manufacturing sector, which is a core component of industrialization. We chose the employment metric because it represents the proportion of the workforce employed in industrial sectors. It provides insights into the labor market structure and the importance of industrial activities in the employment landscape. A higher percentage indicates a larger industrial workforce, suggesting a more industrialized economy.\n\nWe ranked each country from highest to lowest for both metrics, with a rank of 1 indicating the highest manufacturing output or highest employment in industry. To determine the overall level of industrialization, we assigned a weight of 0.8 to the manufacturing output rank and 0.2 to the employment in the industry rank. We then calculated a weighted average rank for each country. The countries are presented in ascending order of their weighted average rank, where 1 indicates the highest level of industrialization and 17 the lowest.\n\nPlease note that there are three transcontinental countries on the list i.e., Egypt, Turkey and Russia.\n\n20.

Yeah, good times.\n\nUnfortunately for companies that went all-in on the idea, living your life totally connected to the online world hasn’t gone according to plan. While the virtual hellscape is not dead, it does give off a death rattle.\n\nMost people did not even know what the metaverse was until Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Despite its misnamed alternate reality division Reality Labs losing $50 billion since 2020, the social media giant continues to throw billions more into the sinkhole. Investors were worried it was going to repeat the mistake when it noticeably shifted its attention to artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile AI has sucked all the oxygen out of the room so that hardly anyone even discusses the metaverse anymore, there are still companies tied to it. And because the world has seemingly moved beyond this virtual world, investors should be wary of the three metaverse stocks to sell below.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThree years ago, Unity Software (NYSE: U) was going to power the metaverse. It even acquired Metaverse Technologies for $45 million because of its ability to enhance 3D computer-aided design visualization performance.\n\nBecause the Unity Engine is a leader in virtual and augmented reality, not to mention gaming, it was responsible for powering most of the world’s mobile games. Yet as the gaming market cooled off and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) changed its privacy policies that impacted Unity’s advertising business, U stock went into a deep freeze, too.\n\nUnity Software lost 86% of its value over the last three years and over 92% from its late-2021 peak. Although the company is still an important component of the gaming market as well as in the VR and AR worlds, the metaverse is doing nothing to help.\n\nThe software specialist is losing ground to Epic Games Unreal Engine, it is downsizing its business still and there are few prospects for turning a profit anytime soon. For all the promise Unity Software held with driving the metaverse forward, it is now a prime metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline gaming platform Roblox (NASDAQ: RBLX) has fared only a little better than Unity Software, losing 72% of its value from the height of its 2021 valuation. Shares are down 16% so far this year, though they had been much lower.\n\nIts immersive gaming platform remains entwined with the metaverse, which is what is holding it back. Because there is little development in education, industrial usage, or services, in the metaverse there seems no catalyst to fire up growth. While it can attract users to its gaming platform, as noted previously that market has largely stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond-quarter daily average users rose 21% to 79.5 million and monthly unique payers rose 22% to 16.5 million. So the site is still able to attract players. But bookings, which refers to sales of Roblox’s virtual currency, rose less than revenue. That indicates overall slower growth is coming in the future.\n\nRoblox also still generates losses. They only improved slightly to $205.8 million from $282.7 million last year. The gaming platform still has a tough slog ahead of it and it trades at a premium valuation, making it a metaverse stock to sell.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Illustration of the metaverse. A young boy wearing a VR headset is in the metaverse.\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTypically buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a way to spread out risk while capturing all of a sector’s growth potential. In the case of Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA: METV), it was a way to absorb all the risk of the metaverse, as it is proving to be more fad than trend.\n\nThe ETF’s stock is down 20% in 2024 and it sits almost 30% below its all-time high. With Roblox being its top holding, representing over 9% of the portfolio, and Unity Software a top-10 pick, the only reason it is not faring worse is because it also owns a handful of Magnificent 7 stocks. Apple, Meta and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) account for over 18% of its holdings. Yet other than Meta, the other two are only tangentially related to the metaverse.\n\nA look at its holdings also shows why you can’t just go by an ETF’s name before you buy. It owns a collection of top chipmakers, cloud stocks and gaming companies. There are actually very few metaverse stocks in the portfolio.\n\nEven so, Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has vastly underperformed the S&P 500. While it sports a reasonable 0.59% expense ratio, its inability to capitalize on the tech industry’s growth while avoiding the pitfalls of its true metaverse stocks makes it an ETF to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee\n\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Apple on Thursday changed its policy in the European Union to allow developers to communicate with their customers outside the app after the Commission charged the iPhone maker in June for breaching the bloc's tech rules.\n\nThe Commission had said that under most of the business terms, Apple allows steering only through \"link-outs\", meaning that app developers can include a link in their app that redirects the customer to a web page where the customer can conclude a contract.\n\nApple said developers will now be able to communicate and promote offers that are available anywhere, not just on their own website, from within their app.\n\nHowever, Apple will introduce two new fees - an initial 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store services fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within the 12 months of the app installation.\n\nCurrently, Apple charges three types of fees: a core technology fee for the less than 1% of apps, a reduced commission for all digital goods and services sold through the App Store, and an optional fee for the payments and commerce services.\n\nThe two new fees will replace the reduced commission for all digital goods and services sold through the App Store.\n\nThe Commission had earlier criticised the fees charged by Apple for facilitating via the App Store the initial acquisition of a new customer by developers, saying they went beyond what was strictly necessary for such remuneration.\n\nThe charge against Apple is the first by the Commission under its landmark Digital Markets Act which seeks to rein in the power of Big Tech and DMA violations could result in a fine of as much as 10% of a company's global annual turnover.\n\nApple said there has been an ongoing dialog with the European Commission and the changes made were in response to the announcements made in June.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; editing by David Evans)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The UK’s competition watchdog has confirmed it is launching a merger inquiry into Amazon’s partnership with AI firm Anthropic.\n\nThe tech giant has invested four billion US dollars (£3.1 billion) into the US AI firm.\n\nOn Thursday, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it has “sufficient information” to begin an initial investigation into the partnership, in order to establish whether a more in-depth review is needed.\n\nThe decision is the latest in a string of decisions from the regulator around examining the close partnerships between big technology firms and emerging AI companies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn recent weeks, the CMA has announced investigations into Microsoft over its hiring of a number of staff from start-up Inflection AI to its new dedicated AI team, while Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, is also being examined over a partnership with Anthropic.\n\nIn April, the CMA published a report highlighting concerns it had over potential risks to open, fair and effective competition in the AI market.\n\nIt specifically highlighted what it called an “interconnected web” of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments from the biggest names in tech – including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft – and emerging AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector among a few companies.\n\nAmazon, as well as Alphabet, has invested heavily in Anthropic, while Microsoft is the largest investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI has also formed a partnership with Apple to embed ChatGPT into future generations of the iPhone as part of Apple’s plans to bring more generative AI tools to its products.\n\nConcerns have been raised that these big investments and partnership deals could see large companies exert some control over the direction of AI firms without attracting the regulatory scrutiny that a full acquisition might.\n\nAmazon has been contacted for comment.",

        "title": "Apple’s Mac Mini With M4 Chip Will Be Its Smallest Computer Ever",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning a new version of the Mac mini that will be its smallest desktop computer yet, part of a broader overhaul of the Mac line with AI-focused chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfrica’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure NYC Subway Riders See ‘Exceptionally High’ Air Pollution New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing New York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\n\nThe new model — due later this year — will mark the first major design change to the mini since it was revamped under Steve Jobs in 2010, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The device will be far smaller than its predecessor, approaching the size of an Apple TV set-top box, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the work is secret.\n\nThe updated mini is one of several new Macs coming over the next several months. The company is preparing versions of the iMac desktop and MacBook Pro with chips from the M4 line, also for as early as this year. There are MacBook Airs in development for the spring, and Mac Pro and Mac Studio models are planned for the middle of next year.\n\nThe mass upgrade to the M4 processor marks another milestone for Apple: It’s the first time the company is putting the same chip generation in all its Macs. The M4 silicon — already featured in the iPad Pro — is meant to power new artificial intelligence features that Apple is beginning to roll out later this year.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the company’s plans.\n\nDespite the smaller overall design, the new Mac mini may be taller than the current version. Today’s model is about 1.4 inches high. The updated edition will still feature an aluminum shell.\n\nThe Apple TV box, meanwhile, is about 3.7 inches across — currently less than half the size of the Mac mini.\n\nApple has tested models with at least three USB-C ports on the back of the mini, in addition to an area for plugging in the power cable and an HDMI port for connecting the device to TV sets and monitors.\n\nPeople involved in the development of the new Mac mini say it’s essentially an iPad Pro in a small box — an approach that takes advantage of the lower power requirements of the company’s in-house silicon. The current Mac mini starts at $599, and while the new model may be cheaper to make, it’s unclear if the company will pass along any savings to the consumer.\n\nApple is preparing two versions of the new Mac mini, both of which are codenamed J773. The first will use the base configuration of the M4 chip, similar to the component inside of the iPad Pro. There will also be a higher-end Mac mini that uses a yet-to-be-announced M4 Pro chip. That component includes support for additional memory and more graphics horsepower.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple suppliers are planning to begin shipping units of the standard M4 version this month for release later in the year. Units with the higher-end M4 Pro won’t be ready for consumers until October. The Mac mini was last updated in early 2023 with M2 and M2 Pro chips. It gained the M1 chip in November 2020 as part of the first range of Macs with Apple silicon.\n\nApple’s shift to its own computer processors helped fuel sales and accelerated the pace of upgrades. But Mac demand has slowed since the pandemic, when consumers were racing to equip their home offices.\n\nThe category generated about $7 billion in revenue last quarter, up 2.5% from a year earlier.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Happens When Ozempic Takes Over Your Town Nate Silver Wants to Teach You How to Be a Better Gambler Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Mark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Five Questions for Trump Adviser Scott Bessent\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Computer Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry participants are benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple AAPL and HP HPQ are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers.  However, industry participants are suffering from waning demand for consumer PCs. Geopolitical challenges, including persistent inflation and high interest, are major headwinds. Weak demand in China has been a headwind.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Micro Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption RemainsHealthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\r\n\r\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\r\n\r\nAI-enabled PCs to Boost Demand: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, are expected to benefit from AI infusion. Canalys expects AI-enabled PC shipments to reach 48 million in 2024, representing 18% of total PC shipments.

        "content": "In 2021, Charlie Munger Told Warren Buffett It Was A Mistake To Sell Apple Shares. Will He Be Right Again?\n\nIn investing, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are household names, synonymous with success and financial wisdom. But even the best can sometimes have doubts, as evident during Berkshire Hathaway’s 2021 annual meeting.\n\nBuffett, often regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, made headlines when he decided to sell some of Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple shares despite them being described as Berkshire’s “fourth jewel” alongside their insurance operations, BNSF Railway and the Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary Buffett chose to reduce their stake.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nThis decision confused many people, including a shareholder from Switzerland who asked why Buffett would sell Apple shares if the company was so important to Berkshire’s portfolio.\n\nWhy Did Buffett Sell?\n\nBuffett explained that Berkshire owns 5.3% of Apple, a stake that increased due to share buybacks by both Berkshire and Apple. This strategy allowed Berkshire to increase its company share without spending more money.\n\nTrending: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nHe elaborated on Apple’s extraordinary business model, its massive fan base, and the “fantastic manager” at its helm, Tim Cook. Buffett praised Cook by saying, “He's handled that business so well ... he couldn't do what Steve Jobs obviously could do in terms of creation, but I don't think Steve Jobs could do what Tim Cook has done in many respects.”\n\nHowever, despite all the praise for Apple, Buffett admitted to selling some shares, which he later regretted. In his words, “That was probably a mistake.”\n\nTrending: This investment company boasts a 35.14% internal rate of return (IRR) for its realized projects, allowing accredited investors to earn passive returns and avoid the headaches of being a landlord.\n\nCharlie Munger's Input\n\nCharlie’s way of pointing out mistakes is less dramatic but no less effective. According to Buffett, “Charlie, in his usual low-key way, let me know that [he] thought it was a mistake too.”\n\nHe continued talking to Munger on stage, “I could only do so many things that I can get away with Charlie. I used them up between Costco and Apple ... and suddenly, he probably very likely was right in both circumstances.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett’s choice to sell some of Apple’s shares might seem surprising, especially since he really admires the brand. He likened the value of Apple products to that of cars, suggesting that some people might even choose their Apple devices over their vehicles. “You know, a car costs $35,000, and I'm sure with some people if you ask them whether they had to give up their Apple or their car ... who knows what they’d do,” he quipped, reflecting the deep loyalty of Apple users.\n\nTrending: Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nBuffett’s 2024 Apple Stock Sale: Another Mistake?\n\nAt the beginning of August 2024, Buffett sold a big chunk of Berkshire Hathaway’s Apple shares, cutting their investment in half. Berkshire sold off $76 billion worth of stocks, making a massive after-tax profit of $47.2 billion and boosting Berkshire's cash reserves to an all-time high of $277 billion.\n\nAlthough this is probably very far from a mistake, it also makes one wonder if they might be missing out on the long-term value of holding onto the stock. Naturally, Apple’s stock took a hit after the fact but remains a key part of many investment portfolios because of its strong market position.\n\nThe decision to sell could be seen as contradictory to the confidence he expressed in the company’s future prospects at its annual meeting just a couple of months ago, when he said, \"Unless something dramatically happens that really changes capital allocation strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment.\"\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

        "title": "Kevin O'Leary Says California Is A Dumpster Fire For Business. Is He Right?",
        "content": "Kevin O'Leary Says California Is A Dumpster Fire For Business. Is He Right?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe recent news that Chevron is leaving San Ramon, CA, for Houston, TX, is another example of what has been termed the California exodus. Many businesses have left the Golden State over the last several years.\n\nSpeaking with Fox Business, Shark Tank entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary explained what he thinks is happening. He noted that much of the shift has happened since 2019 when Gavin Newsom took office as California's governor. O'Leary called Newsom a great guy but someone who has \"no executional skills and no idea what is going on here.\" He accused Newsom of turning his state into a version of Venezuela with broken policies.\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nO'Leary pointed out that he has many food businesses but doesn’t touch California because of its minimum wage. California raised the minimum wage from $16 to $20 in April, which has impacted major food service businesses. Some companies, including Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), have raised their prices to compensate for the higher business costs. That can be a risky game in this economy with a price-sensitive consumer.\n\nIs It Just Business Policies?\n\nO'Leary called California a dumpster fire, saying that energy is the lifeblood of the economy and that losing a significant energy business like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) would be a big blow to the state. While he blamed Newsom, the problem may have been going on longer than his tenure as governor. The California Policy Institute found that over 237 businesses have left the state since 2005, and that doesn’t include some of the most recent announcements. On that list were 11 Fortune 1000 companies. Other factors beyond business policies may be influencing these moves. One of them is the high cost of living and the other is the cost of real estate, which makes it hard for many employees to afford a home. The Public Policy Institute of California found that California has higher rates of cost-burdened households than the U.S. as a whole, prompting some people to consider moving.\n\nOverwhelmingly, companies are moving to Texas. Of the 237 companies mentioned above, 120 moved to Texas, and the state has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state. Commercial Property Executive rounded up the most popular areas for relocation, and the Dallas and Austin areas were the runaway winners. Florida was also on the list, with Orlando and Miami as destination cities. Both states are known for having no income tax and business-friendly policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nOprah, Madonna and DiCaprio have turned to the alternative asset that is outperforming the S&P 500. Discover the potential of this market before other investors. Don’t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nIt's not just California that O'Leary says is bad for business. He mentioned that he recently optioned land for a data center in West Virginia, which is something he would never do in upstate New York because \"you can't get anything done in New York.\"\n\nO'Leary suggested that a \"change in management\" was necessary to turn the tide for California, but the reasons are more complicated than just who sits in the governor's seat. Much of it has to do with the high cost of living in the state, especially in the coastal areas. Despite the companies moving away from the state, it is still home to many big technology companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META). It is the fifth-largest economy in the world, with a GDP of nearly $3.1 trillion in 2023 and a growth rate of 6.1%. In April, the governor's office reported that California is still tops in the U.S. for new business starts and access to venture capital. The state is seeing a migration, but California still has business opportunities.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Sell in August Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Fintech looks to be the next big thing. It is incorporating elements from every sector, from hardware (card readers) to software (online payment processing) and now AI in fraud detection. With this, new opportunities to make money arise, and investors should be cautious about how they participate in these opportunities.\n\nThe financial technology market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% until 2029, making it a sector investors should consider. However, like any high-return opportunity, investing in fintech companies carries significant risk. To mitigate those risks, it is important to stay informed and keep an open mind about the general consensus regarding investments.\n\nKnowing when to sell is just as important as knowing when to buy. That said, here are three companies that I believe you should offload for now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is a company that offers financial solutions to consumers and businesses. It operates Square and CashApp, both of which are leading payment interfaces. While it operates primarily in the United States, it also provides its services internationally.\n\nWhile SQ’s revenue is increasing significantly, profit isn’t keeping pace. Although the company posted a year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 11.2%, it only had a profit margin of 2.9%. In addition to a return on assets of 1.12%, both metrics are significantly lower than those of its competitors. Insiders only own 0.8% of SQ’s shares. The percentage is quite low relative to other companies and is a negative indicator.\n\nThe company is reportedly reorganizing soon. This will prove to be a big shift for employees, as layoffs are also part of the plan. The long-term impact of these moves creates uncertainty for Block, with their full effect yet to be priced in. For now, investors should be weary and might want to consider selling portions of their investments.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Affirm financial stocks to sell\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) operates primarily as a digital sales facilitator and has point-of-sale terminals. However, one of its most notable features is that it allows consumers to spread payments out — if you’ve ever shopped on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), you’ve likely noticed a “Pay with Affirm” pop-up on your screen. It trades at $24.16, representing a market cap below $7.5 billion.\n\nWhile revenue has been on a progressive uptrend over the last four years, it is important to note that losses have been, too. Additionally, the company currently has a debt/equity ratio of 20.89. The company is operating on significant leverage, which could be a big risk in the long run. Additionally, analysts have lowered EPS predictions recently.\n\nStory continues\n\nAFRM faces multiple threats. From a point-of-sales standpoint, there are numerous competing services. Apple Pay is a big contender. AFRM also faces stiff competition in the buy now sell later space, with companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) allegedly coming out with improvements to Apple Pay Later. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) also offers a pay-later service. Due to this, I think that AFRM will face significant challenges in the future and is a stock you should sell.\n\nCoinbase Global (COIN) An image of the logo for Coinbase Global Inc (COIN).\n\nCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) is one of the most recognizable crypto exchanges. For readers unfamiliar with the concept of a crypto exchange, think about where you invest your money — just like your broker, crypto exchanges facilitate cryptocurrency trading. As of the market close on 8/6, COIN is trading for $194.17, giving it a slightly over $48 billion valuation.\n\nWhile the company is experiencing solid growth, with revenue surging over 100% in Q2, profits remain nonexistent. The company only barely made a profit in fiscal year 2023. With a beta of 3.4, this company remains a volatile investment. COIN also significantly missed Q2 EPS estimates by $0.79.\n\nThis brings me to my main point—the revenue COIN collects directly affects crypto prices, particularly those of more popular coins such as Bitcoin (BTC). This is because it collects revenue on each transaction made on a percentage basis, and thus, generally, if the price of crypto is higher, it will collect more revenue. This represents a significant risk for investors, and thus, any investors who don’t accept this should consider selling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These Analysts Think Apple (AAPL) is Still One of the Best AI Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a “little bit of a reset, obviously.” The analyst said that AI stocks had a “great run” and the latest pullback is a “typical process” of market rotation.\n\n“It doesn’t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that’s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,” Landsberg said.\n\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said “absolutely not” and called the recent pullback “deceleration” from growth and “normalization.”\n\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will “separate the wheat from the chaff” and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\n\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Among the Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the limelight after the company posted decent quarterly results, where declines in iPhone sales were more than offset by services revenue and Mac sales gains. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock and increased his price target to $285 from $275.\n\n“Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout has already begun with developers who will significantly enhance app capabilities as the company staggers the launch of its new AI feature along with its OpenAI partnership which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  expects ChatGPT and all other features to be integrated into the iPhone and other devices by the end of the year. We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share.” Ives said.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said he sees more upside for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the December quarter and next year on the back of Apple Intelligence. The analyst reiterated a Buy rating and $256 price target on Apple.\n\nHe said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) estimates could be revised higher due to “multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margins and strong cash flows.”\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\n\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it’s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This Hypergrowth Company Will Be Wall Street's First $6 Trillion Stock -- and It's Not Nvidia!",
        "content": "Change is one of the only constants investors will find on Wall Street. Thanks to a combination of innovation, acquisitions, mergers, bankruptcies, legal judgments, competition, and even Acts of God, the stock market's \"leaderboard\" is constantly in flux. This is to say that Wall Street's largest companies today aren't liable to hold their positions five, 10, or even 20 years from now.\n\nJust six years ago, tech goliath Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made history by becoming the first publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market cap. By June 2023, it had crossed the psychological $3 trillion barrier. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt took less than five years for the stock market's largest company to triple in value, which begs the question: Which hypergrowth company will be the first to double the current peak of a little over $3 trillion in market cap and reach a $6 trillion valuation?\n\nWhile I'll give you my very clear prediction in a moment, let me work my way backwards and show why some of today's most-influential businesses within the \"Magnificent Seven\" aren't the answer.\n\nNvidia and Apple? No chance.\n\nConsidering that artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest thing since sliced bread, you'd think AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would have the inside track to becoming Wall Street's most-valuable business. However, I've been pointing out for months just how many headwinds the ace of the AI movement is set to face.\n\nDespite having superior AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) with top-notch compute ability, Nvidia's inability to satisfy all of its customers will open the door for external competitors to grab market share.\n\nLikewise, all four of Nvidia's largest customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing AI chips of their own. Even if these chips are purely complementary to Nvidia's H100 GPUs, they're going to take up valuable data center space and lessen the need for Nvidia's hardware in the years to come.\n\nThe biggest worry might just be that every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years has navigated its way through a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. With most businesses lacking a clear gameplan with their AI investments, it looks probable that the AI bubble will burst sooner than later, and ultimately drag Nvidia down with it.\n\nAs for Apple, its growth engine has mostly stalled out. Net sales are up by about 1% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). Although a record-breaking buyback program has been a major help to Apple's bottom line, it makes no sense for investors to pay a high multiple to earnings if Apple's sales growth is hardly above the flatline.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile subscription services continue to be a bright spot -- up 13.2% through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023 -- lagging iPhone sales are liable to drag on Apple's share price.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms? Possibly, but ample headwinds exist.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) do have a path to a $6 trillion valuation, but would need things to go just right for it to happen.\n\nMicrosoft enjoys sustainable moats and exorbitant cash flow from its legacy Windows and Office segments, and should deliver double-digit sales growth from Azure, the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform. With plenty of cash on hand, Microsoft can easily invest for the future via organic or inorganic means.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is also heavily tied to the AI revolution via its investments in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT. If the AI bubble were to burst, as I expect it will, it could be hit harder than other \"Magnificent Seven\" members, aside from Nvidia.\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet should benefit nicely from the growth of its cloud infrastructure service platform known as Google Cloud. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its early innings, which bodes well for this high-margin operating segment.\n\nThe only true knock I have against Alphabet is its strongly cyclical ties. With roughly 76% of its $84.7 billion in second-quarter sales derived from advertising, Alphabet will always be somewhat tethered to the health of the U.S. and global economy, as well as investor sentiment.\n\nComparatively, Meta Platforms is even more reliant on advertising. Just shy of 98% of its $75.5 billion in net sales through the first-half of 2024 have come from ads on its social media platforms.\n\nAlthough long-winded economic expansions are a positive for Meta's ad-driven operating model, and the company's metaverse investments have a chance to pay off in a big way in the latter-half of this decade, its stock would have to quintuple in value to become Wall Street's first $6 trillion company. This seems a stretch given the potential for U.S. economic growth to slow in the coming quarters. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $6 trillion stock is likely to be...\n\nThough it's going to take some time -- i.e., don't expect the stock market's outsized annual returns to continue indefinitely -- my prediction is that Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will cut the proverbial ribbon and cross the $6 trillion threshold before any other publicly traded company.\n\nWhile most people have acquainted themselves with Amazon through its globally leading online marketplace, the nuts-and-bolts that generate the bulk of the company's operating cash flow have little to do with e-commerce.\n\nFirst and foremost, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. AWS held a 31% share of cloud infrastructure services spending as of the end of 2023, with annual run-rate sales topping $105 billion, as of June 30. This segment is consistently responsible for 50% to 100% of Amazon's operating income, and it should play a key role in doubling Amazon's operating cash flow by 2026.\n\nAmazon is also just beginning to harness the value of its content via its Prime subscription service. Landing an 11-year streaming deal with the National Basketball Association (NBA), coupled with being the exclusive partner of Thursday Night Football, makes Amazon's video platform the wave of the future. It should have no trouble increasing Prime subscription prices, as well as generating boatloads of advertising revenue.\n\nSpeaking of advertising services, Amazon is seeing north of 3 billion visits to its website on a monthly basis. Since many visitors to Amazon are motivated shoppers, businesses are willing to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of users. Not surprisingly, Amazon's advertising services segment has delivered year-over-year constant-currency sales growth of at least 20% dating back more than two years.\n\nEven if the AI bubble bursts and takes Nvidia and Microsoft down with it, Amazon's various fast-growing ancillary channels can sustain double-digit growth.\n\nWhat's more, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock during the 2010s. Investors in Amazon today are only paying 11.5 times forecast cash flow for 2025. If Amazon were to be valued at the same median cash-flow multiple it carried throughout the 2010s, and it continues to grow at its existing pace, it would have the clearest path to a $6 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "US futures, jobless claims, Apple - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street futures are drifting lower Thursday ahead of the release of the weekly jobless claims data. Apple is in the spotlight over claims it could charge for its AI product, while the impact of the global carry trade remains in focus.\n\n1. Futures slip lower\n\nU.S. stock futures edged lower Thursday, stabilizing to a degree following several dramatic swings in recent days.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 100 points, or 0.3%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 15 points, or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 32 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed lower Wednesday, unable to hold an early rally, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing over 200 points, or 0.6%, lower, while both the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Thursday, including from drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and fashion retailer Under Armour (NYSE:UA).\n\nAdditionally, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock slumped 30% premarket after the online dating agency cut its annual revenue growth forecast, sparking worries about its growth plans.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) stock fell almost 10% premarket after the entertainment giant reported a quarterly net loss of $10 billion, announcing it has written down the value of its traditional television networks by $9.1bn, a dramatic recognition of how fast streaming is eroding the cable business model.\n\n2. Jobless claims in focus\n\nWorries about a U.S. hard landing, after Friday’s weak nonfarm payrolls release, sparked the sharp selloff on Wall Street.\n\nWith this in mind, the macro spotlight is squarely on the weekly jobless claims figures out of the U.S. later in the day, with economists expecting initial jobless claims to total 241,000 last week, a small reduction from the prior week’s 249,000.\n\nThat release showed the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week, adding to fears that the labor market was cooling quickly.\n\nThe report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showed the number of people on jobless rolls swelling in mid-July to the highest level since late 2021.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that while he viewed the changes in the labor market as \"broadly consistent with a normalization process,\" policymakers were \"closely monitoring to see whether it starts to show signs that it's more than that.\"\n\n3. 75% of carry trade removed - JPMorgan\n\nOne of the main contributors to the market turmoil of the last few days has been the unwinding of the global carry trade - which involves investors borrowing money in a place where interest rates are low and using it to invest elsewhere in assets that generate a higher return.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor years this has widely involved the Japanese yen, as the Bank of Japan has held interest rates near zero in an attempt to stimulate a stagnant economy.\n\nHowever, the BOJ raised interest rates last week, while rates are already falling in a number of other regions while the Federal Reserve has signaled that it may join this club next month.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan said in a note that the risk-reward for global carry is low due to U.S. elections and potential repricing of funders on lower U.S. rates and rates momentum is expected to turn more significantly against G10 carry which favors the rotation to value.\n\nIt added carry baskets have already suffered a significant drawdown following the tech sell-off, and the spot component of the global carry basket suggests that 75% of carry trades have been removed.\n\n4. Apple could charge users $20 for AI product\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expressed optimism over its iPhone sales going forward at its latest quarterly release, as it expects additional features based on artificial intelligence to attract buyers.\n\nThe tech giant is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone, including artificial intelligence features - known as Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple could charge its users up to $20 for its advanced artificial intelligence features, analysts told CNBC, as the company looks to boost the growth of its lucrative services business.\n\nApple’s services division brought in $24.2 billion in the June quarter, making it unique as many other hardware firms have not managed to monetize software.\n\nIt is not unusual for technology firms to charge for their AI offerings. OpenAI, for example, has a subscription fee for more advanced ChatGPT features and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) charges for its AI Copilot tool.\n\n5. Crude falls on weak Chinese import data\n\nCrude prices retreated Thursday, on course to end a two-day winning streak, as dismal economic data from top oil importer China reignited concerns surrounding global demand.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.1% to $75.19 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $78.21 a barrel.\n\nData released earlier Thursday showed China imported around 10 million barrels of oil in July, down 12% from June and 3% lower than the same period last year.\n\nConcerns over Chinese growth, coupled with fears of a U.S. recession, have weighed heavily on oil prices in recent sessions.\n\nBoth benchmarks had gained around 3% over the last two sessions, bouncing off near-2024 lows, helped by the simmering tensions in the Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, crude inventories in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, fell 3.7 million barrels, data showed, marking a sixth straight weekly decline to six-month lows.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures, jobless claims, Apple - what's moving markets\n\nAnalysis-BOJ's communication about-face may haunt future rate moves\n\nMusk stirs UK divisions, sparks calls for faster rollout of online safety laws\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- PC maker HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) is planning to shift more than half of its computer production away from China amid concerns over geopolitical risks with Taiwan, Nikkei Asia reported.\n\nHP has set an internal goal of making up to 70% of its notebooks outside China, and is looking at Singapore and Thailand as potential production destinations, the Nikkei report said.\n\nThe firm is setting up a backup design hub in Singapore, while at least five HP suppliers are building production facilities and storage areas in Thailand, the Nikkei report said.\n\nHP has a major production presence in China and Taiwan, but now appears to be joining a slew of its technology peers in diversifying its supply chain away from the region.\n\nPeers such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) were seen shifting production away from China and into Southeast Asia over the past two years, amid disruptions from China’s strict zero-COVID policies and as trade tensions with the U.S. grew.\n\nU.S. trade restrictions against China are set to become a bigger point of contention for tech manufacturers in the country, especially after Washington banned the export of advanced artificial intelligence technology to China.\n\nThis has led to manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) developing chips specifically geared towards the Chinese market- a move that is also expected to increase costs.\n\nTensions with Taiwan have also increased in recent years, as China kept up its rhetoric of reuniting the island with the mainland.

        "title": "US stock futures drift lower as rebound stalls, tech weakness persists",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Wednesday after a Wall Street rebound ran out of steam, while weakness in technology stocks persisted as major chipmakers were pressured by middling earnings.\n\nLosses in futures followed a volatile session on Wall Street, where stock benchmarks ended lower despite a strong start to the day. U.S. stock indexes were nursing steep losses over the past week amid heightened concerns over a recession.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.4% to 5,208.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.5% to 17,873.0 points by 19:16 ET (23:16 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 38,822.0 points.\n\nTech sees extended losses after Super Micro tumble\n\nMajor technology stocks saw extended losses in aftermarket trade, with Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) in the lead after it clocked underwhelming earnings for the June quarter. Super Micro fell 2% after plummeting 20% during the session.\n\nThe firm’s underwhelming earnings added to doubts over just how much demand the artificial intelligence will fuel, and sparked extended losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 1.2%, while Super Micro peer Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) slid over 6%.\n\nLosses in chipmakers also soured already weak sentiment towards broader tech stocks, with majors such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) losing between 0.7% and 1.2% in aftermarket trade.\n\nA rout in technology stocks was a key driver of Wall Street’s losses in recent weeks, as middling earnings from the biggest stocks in the sector sparked heavy profit-taking. Expectations of interest rate cuts also saw investors pivot into more economically sensitive stocks, although this trade was also stymied by fears of a U.S. recession.\n\nWall Street nurses losses as rebound stalls\n\nWall Street indexes closed lower on Wednesday as a rebound from two and three-month lows largely stalled.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 5,199.50 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 1% to 16,198.86 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 38,763.45 points.\n\nAll three indexes were nursing steep losses over the past few weeks, with the Nasdaq having entered correction territory on Monday.\n\nLosses were sparked by increasing fears of a recession, following a slew of weak readings on the labor market and business activity. A slew of disappointing earnings also battered sentiment.\n\nWeak earnings continued to trickle in. Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) slid 11% in aftermarket trade on disappointing second-quarter earnings, while Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) fell nearly 2%, extending losses from the session after it also logged weak earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nBumble Inc (NASDAQ:BMBL) plummeted 30% after it cut its annual revenue forecast.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures drift lower as rebound stalls, tech weakness persists\n\nChina's drivers fret as robotaxis pick up pace - and passengers\n\nUS judge tosses much of Mexico's lawsuit against US gun makers\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Dump as Investors Rotate to Dow Jones Components",
        "content": "Monday’s sudden market crash disrupted investor sentiment. However, growing recession fears have investors pondering which stocks to sell in anticipation of a potential rotation into the Dow Jones.\n\nIn July, investors were concerned that tech stocks had peaked after riding high on artificial intelligence (AI) developments. Some stocks were sold into more stable options concentrated in the Dow Jones or, in some cases, holding cash. For example, Warren Buffett reduced Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B)Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holdings by half last quarter, realizing gains and accumulating over a quarter trillion for the next market move.\n\nInvestors seeking to emulate the Oracle of Omaha have few names to choose from, as first-half gains came mostly from tech stocks. These could now lose favor as small-cap and value stocks are seen as stronger in an uncertain environment with interest rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns. Whether the “great rotation” means buying safer Dow components or the overall market declines, some tech stocks might be sold for the Dow rotation as valuations may unnerve traders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three stocks that could see price declines as traders rotate to Dow Jones components and other safer areas in this top-heavy, overvalued market.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world’s largest crypto exchanges could be particularly vulnerable if the market turmoil doesn’t calm down. Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) reported a relatively solid Q2 earnings report, riding the surge of interest in cryptocurrencies. However, as the flash crash shows, crypto is particularly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. The company could quickly reverse its fortunes if the U.S. economic situation deteriorates.\n\nCOIN stock is up 35% this year thanks to investors hoping the economy will thread a relatively narrow gap. This gap is between growing too fast so that the Fed will cut rates and slowing down so that investors stay away from high-risk assets like crypto. As such, Coinbase trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.7 times. This is actually quite good for a tech stock. However, that’s not where the problem lies.\n\nThe company held crypto assets worth $1.2 billion at the end of last quarter. Even with the price of BTC (BTC-USD) remaining relatively stable from April to June, it recorded a $319 million impact on its profit. A substantial drop in the price of crypto could severely impact the company’s bottom line and drag the stock price significantly lower. Therefore, investors should consider Coinbase as one of the stocks to sell for Dow rotation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe PC chipmaker has been riding Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) coattails as investors expect other companies to develop rival AI chips. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has invested heavily in AI. The company does have AI-oriented chips for PCs. However, it still hasn’t made any headway in taking market share from Nvidia’s enterprise-level AI chips that concentrate most of the sector’s investment.\n\nInvestors have pushed the company’s P/E ratio into the triple digits. Yet, its EPS hasn’t kept up. Although the AMD stock price has been drifting lower through the second quarter, it could still have further to go before its valuation stabilizes. Investors may want to consider AMD as one of the stocks to sell for Dow rotation.\n\nAMD currently trades at a P/E ratio of 160 times, which is four times higher than the tech sector average. Analysts have been cutting their outlook for the company over the last three months. They expect the net quarter’s EPS to come in at $0.92, down from the $0.95 expected previously.\n\nDataDog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cloud hosting company is another firm riding the AI wave that has pushed its valuation to really high overexpectations. It appears that in the future, DataDog (NASDAQ:DDOG) will see strong demand thanks to all the data hosting and processing power that AI will need.\n\nDespite the company’s most recent reported sales growing at a 27% clip, it only just returned to profitability. Any hiccup in AI development could lower its earnings. For instance, major corporations could slow down spending on AI items due to transient economic uncertainty.\n\nDataDog’s main problem in an environment where fear is overtaking greed is that its P/E ratio stands at 308.7 times. This makes DDOG stock a highly speculative investment. Also, its market cap exceeds its enterprise value and the company still pays no dividends.\n\nWhile it might have good potential in the future, investors may want to consider keeping it on the sell list of stocks to sell for Dow rotation. After all, the current market uncertainty has not been resolved yet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "AI stocks have gone out of style in recent weeks, and while some of the names may have been overvalued, it’s unlikely that an AI bubble is bursting before our eyes.\n\nNot to discount the magnitude of pain that the latest tech plunge has inflicted on investor portfolios, but the S&P 500 hasn’t even officially entered correction territory (that’s a 10% fall from the top) quite yet. Though the Nasdaq 100 is down around 13%, only three and a half months’ worth of gains have been wiped out so far.\n\nFurther, recession fears seem unfounded after just one poor jobs report. Though the correction and potential growth scare could entail more pain to come for tech, I’d argue that innovation in AI will keep on pushing forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere’s really no stopping the AI train in its tracks once it’s left the station. Recession or not, AI will just keep getting better, more useful, and, perhaps most importantly, more monetizable from here. Here are three AI-focused stocks that may be worth pursuing amid the tech sell-off.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) technology company. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the AI darling that’s seen its shares rapidly retreat of late. With NVDA stock now down around 23% from its all-time high, the many who missed the boat on the name may have another shot to buy in at a fairly reasonable multiple.\n\nSurprisingly, NVDA stock hasn’t been hit nearly as hard as some of the other semiconductor firms — think Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after that brutal quarter — out there. With the company continuing to do more than its share of the heavy lifting for the AI boom, there seem to be a handful of reasons to hang on despite recent turbulence.\n\nThough NVDA stock could go either way over the near term, a few analysts are already pounding the table on Nvidia after the latest dip. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer, who’s upbeat on the stock, recently noted that he doesn’t see the company losing market share from recent “minor” production delays.\n\nNvidia mostly seems to be falling for reasons outside its control. As the market lets earnings do the talking (and walking) once again, a rebound for NVDA stock may not be too far off.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew companies are in a position to truly shape the future of technology, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It has changed the world by “thinking differently” many times in the past. Whether we’re talking about the rise of the Mac, iPod or iPhone, it’s clear Apple knows how to polish and fine-tune emerging technologies for mass audiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nUp ahead, the next big thing for Apple seems to be AI. Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT could be a match that changes how we interact with our smartphones. Indeed, the possibilities of an Apple Intelligence iPhone are endless. Still, there’s no guarantee that Apple Intelligence will be the big growth booster many are expecting.\n\nThe latest Apple Intelligence preview has finally arrived. Still, nothing about the first beta seems truly ground-breaking just yet. Maybe the full release will change that.\n\nIn any case, Apple’s AI needs to be as capable as its rivals’, but it also needs to be better, much better, if it wants to grab the AI bull by the horns.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor firm that could single-handedly push PCs into the age of Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) processors. Indeed, Apple’s move into Arm chips has been a successful one. And though Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon X Elite chips are incredibly powerful and power efficient, the PCs incorporating them have had a handful of compatibility issues.\n\nSnapdragon-powered PCs may have arrived, but many programs aren’t ready for the Arm age. It will take some time for developers to get up to speed with the latest Snapdragon-powered PCs. In any case, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip seems like a strong top candidate as PCs look to become better equipped to run AI without having to connect to the cloud.\n\nAfter shedding 30% of its value since its June peak, perhaps now’s as good a time as any to nibble on the name while it’s going for a mere 14.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). The 2.14% dividend yield is also notable.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple.

        "title": "MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, AAPL: Big Tech’s Big Spend on AI",
        "content": "The thrust for artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating with each passing day. The big tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL), are deploying more and more funds toward AI infrastructure, as indicated by their latest quarterly filings. Specifically, each of them has set massive capital expenditure goals, with the aim to reap significant benefits that AI promises to bring in the future. Let’s take a closer look at how much these big tech companies have spent on AI in the June quarter.\n\nMicrosoft(MSFT) – A big supporter and investor of ChatGPT, Microsoft has integrated the OpenAI software in almost all of its products. In Q4 FY24, MSFT spent $13.9 billion on property and equipment, which included cloud and AI-related spending. Nearly 50% of this amount is for data centers, which is expected to generate rewards over the next 15 years, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted. Moreover, Hood pointed out that the company expects spending more in Fiscal 2025, toward cloud and AI segments to meet the burgeoning demand.\n\nAlphabet(GOOGL) – Alphabet has not had an easy way like Microsoft. Alphabet had to build its AI model, Gemini, from scratch and seems to have done a pretty good job so far. For reference, Gemini was used by over 1.5 million developers in Q2. In Q2 FY24, Alphabet spent $13 billion in capex, most of which was directed toward servers and data centers. Alphabet’s CFO Ruth Porat stated that the company expects quarterly capex of $12 billion or more throughout the year. As CEO Sundar Pichai puts it, “When you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.”\n\nMeta Platforms(META) – Meta Platforms reported a capex of $8.5 billion for Q2 FY24, which included investment in network infrastructure, servers, and data centers. The company built its own AI model called Llama and launched its Llama 3.1 version last month. For Fiscal 2024, Meta revised its capex guidance range to $37 to $40 billion from $35-$40 billion, as the company focuses on AI research and product development.\n\nAdditionally, CFO Susan Li stated that Meta expects to incur significant capex growth in 2025 to support its AI ambitions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that Llama 4 model will require 10x more compute than Llama 3, with even higher computing power required for future models. Accordingly, Zuckerberg said, “At this point I’d rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late.”\n\nAmazon.com(AMZN) – Amazon’s cloud service provider, AWS (Amazon Web Service), offers servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security services. The company spent a massive $30.5 billion in capex in the first half of 2024. Amazon intends to spend more on capex in the second half of the year, especially toward AWS infrastructure to support both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is creating its own AI chatbot, called Metis to compete with ChatGPT. Metis will be powered by Amazon’s own AI model, Olympus. CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings call, “I think that the reality right now is that while we’re investing a significant amount in the AI space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today.”\n\nApple(AAPL) – Apple spends the least on AI among these big tech firms, as it is not developing its own generative AI model. Instead, the company has planned to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products. Apple recently announced Apple Intelligence, a system built on years of investments and research in AI and machine learning. The launch date of Apple Intelligence Features was recently delayed to October. The company only did a soft launch for developers to test the features and help fix bugs, if any.\n\nAfter understanding the current and future investments in AI, let’s compare these tech firms using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Some European users will get access to Apple Intelligence after all",
        "content": "Turns out Apple will bring its “Apple Intelligence” AI to Europe after all—though only to a relatively small subset of its userbase.\n\nApple said in late June that it would not roll out Apple Intelligence to EU users because of the interoperability requirements in Europe’s new Big Tech antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act, which it said “could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”\n\nHowever, not every Apple platform is designated as a “gatekeeper” under the DMA—the status that brings with it those interoperability requirements. iOS and iPadOS are both classed as gatekeeper platforms, as are the Safari browser and the App Store, but MacOS is not. Which probably explains why, as 9to5Mac reports, Apple’s release notes for the beta version of the upcoming MacOS Sequoia 15.1 operating system say only that the new AI features will be unavailable in China; there’s no mention of Europe, unlike in the equivalent release notes for the iOS 18.1 beta.\n\nFrom a purely practical point of view, this distinction (which I have asked Apple to confirm; no response yet) would let the company at least get some idea of how European users are responding to the AI features, even if there are about 20 times as many iPhone and iPad users in the EU as there are Mac users.\n\nBut I’m still somewhat amazed that Apple seems set to forego the extra sales of this year’s iPhone that it would achieve if European buyers could get the AI features only that device (and last year’s iPhone Pro and Pro Max) can support. There simply isn’t as much reason to upgrade without that part of the pitch.\n\nThe fact is, we still don’t know what Apple’s problem is with the DMA’s interoperability requirements, a month and a half after Apple made its announcement.\n\nAt the time, I dismissed Apple’s statement with the rather inadequate observation that those requirements focus on messaging. That is one of the focuses, but the DMA also says that Apple would have to let third-party hardware and services tap into the same virtual assistant-controlled iOS features that Apple’s own chatbot can control—and this is where one can more easily imagine some kind of security or privacy issue coming up.\n\nBut imagining is all we can do, as neither Apple nor the European Commission (which enforces the DMA) is explaining the precise problem—the scenario to help us understand exactly how the DMA poses a threat to the safety of Apple Intelligence users (or does not).\n\nFor the Commission, this is supposedly a matter of policy. “We do not comment on individual decisions of companies,” a spokesperson said in a canned reply to my questions today. Commission antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has previously claimed that Apple’s inability to achieve antitrust compliance means “they know 100%” that their strategy for rolling out Apple Intelligence “is another way of disabling competition.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf it can, Apple should hit back at this characterization with some specificity about the security threats it’s trying to ward off.\n\nAfter all, Apple often cries “but security” when regulators tell it to be less closed, and the sky still hasn’t fallen in as a result of, say, the DMA forcing Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe. As things stand, one must give some credence to Vestager’s accusation that the company is effectively saying “we will now deploy AI where we’re not obliged to enable competition.” That claim is in itself annoyingly vague, but if it’s not accurate, Apple needs to explain why.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "JPMorgan Just Raised Its Price Target on These 3 Stocks: August 2024",
        "content": "Analyzing stocks with raised price targets is a sure-shot approach to thrive in any market. Starting the investment path and identifying the appropriate standards for the industry you want to invest in may sometimes become tiresome. But when searching for stocks with raised price targets, you should start with the choices of seasoned behemoths like JPMorgan.\n\nThere are reputable companies that do financial research, such as Wells Fargo Securities (NYSE:WFC) and B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY). Still, only a few can compare to JPMorgan, which has $3.9 trillion in assets worldwide and can analyze and collect a lot of market data. Investors who care about the world value and follow the company’s direction.\n\nExamining equities with higher price targets is particularly crucial at this present time; JPMorgan believes that economic growth will slow down in 2024 and that real GDP growth will drop to around 0.7%. Though core inflation is forecast to stay over the Fed’s 2% target until 2024, inflation trends will probably continue falling. Less than the 3.4% increase seen in 2023, JPMorgan believes that core PCE values will climb by 2.4% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, it’s crucial to be alert and avoid ignoring JPMorgan when evaluating stocks with raised price targets.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is up over 63% this year, thanks to booming sales across its brands and regions. Reflecting this, JPMorgan changed its rating from “neutral” to “overweight” and boosted its price target for ANF from $167 to $194; the consensus price target is $175, translating into a potential upside of 24%.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch recently achieved its greatest first-quarter net sales ever increase and a gross profit margin of 66.4%, up 540 basis points from the previous year.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch will reopen in Pittsburgh and Buffalo. This marks the company’s return to these locations after its Buffalo store closed in 2021. ANF has over $1 billion yearly internet sales to complement its brick-and-mortar approach.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch is also working with McLaren F1. This relationship includes events, social media, and licensed graphic apparel. Abercrombie honored their partnership by exhibiting McLaren’s new Formula 1 car in their Fifth Avenue store and promoting a digital competition to win a racing weekend in Miami.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify’s (NYSE:SPOT) first-quarter gross margins were excellent due to Music and Marketplace growth, as well as improved podcasts and commercials, according to JPMorgan. JPMorgan raised the price target for SPOT stock from $320 to $365, expecting more paying customers and higher pricing in key regions to boost earnings. Experts have rated Spotify a “strong buy.” With an average price target of $392.80, the stock has a possible upside of 24% despite a one-year return of over 128%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify will unveil a $5 HiFi add-on that lets users listen to FLAC music at 24-bit/44.1kHz without loss to compete with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Music, which provide free high-quality music.\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek announced a “deluxe” level. Spotify’s subscription edition will include all the free versions’ features, higher sound quality, music management, AI-powered tracks, and more. Deluxe will likely cost $17 to $18 per month.\n\nSpotify and WPP (NYSE:WPP) also formed a groundbreaking worldwide partnership. This partnership will use Spotify’s audio analytics and WPP’s Choreograph technology to engage WPP clients’ consumers with distinctive and relevant audio ads.\n\nAdditionally, Spotify and Universal Music Group (OTCMKTS:UNVGY) are expanding their partnership. UMG will utilize Spotify’s tools and data to understand audience engagement better and improve fans’ music experiences under this deal.​​\n\nLendingTree (TREE) Lending Tree (TREE) website under magnifying glass\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) is rounding up our list of stocks with raised price targets from JPMorgan; the analyst firm upped its projection of TREE stock from $38 to $53 and reiterated its overweight rating. Maintaining an “outperform” rating, Oppenheimer also upped its price objective for LendingTree from $55 to $65, reflecting confidence in the company’s future performance and possible advantages from an insurance comeback and reduced interest rates.\n\nLending Tree’s modified EBITDA and income surpassed projections; sales fell in the higher range of forecasts. About 5% higher than previous projections, the business has revised its full-year sales prediction to fall between $690 million and $720 million.\n\nLendingTree’s first-quarter profits per share, at 70 cents, exceeded projections by 36 cents. Though down year over year, revenue of $167.8 million exceeded projections by $4.77 million. Again surpassing experts’ projections, the business forecasts sales for the second quarter between $175 million and $190 million, and TREE managed to better these estimates, reporting revenue of $210.1 million.\n\nAnalysts have assigned TREE a “strong buy” consensus: six buys, one hold, and zero sells. Reflecting a 17.86% upward from the latest price of $46.52, the stock has an average price target of $54.83.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in AAPL and AMZN.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding into various industries. However, not all companies have been able to benefit from this growth immediately. Lesser-known data center stocks, for example, are experiencing strong demand. This could substantially boost profits as big tech continues pouring billions into expanding AI capabilities.\n\nMassive AI development investments of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have largely aided infrastructure companies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) clearly succeeds as a manufacturer of the crucial chips powering AI. And, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) sees rising business from hardware sales.\r\n\r\nYet, according to Goldman Sachs, the data center stocks sector is expected to see the highest growth among all capital goods markets this year and through 2027. The bank forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24% for data centers over the next three years.\n\nAs demand for AI surges, three data center stocks are well positioned for potentially exponential growth, with a solid focus on growing sales.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGDS Holdings (GDS) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nHong Kong-based GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS) develops and operates data centers in China and Southeast Asia. It is actively expanding its international footprint, so this could offer higher growth potential than its domestic market. The company has rapidly expanded its infrastructure capacity. The total area committed and pre-committed by customers rose by 5.4% year-over-year (YOY). Also, the area in service increased by 12.5% YOY.\n\nWhile sales increased 9.1% in the prior year and customer commitments grew, the company is not yet profitable. However, it heavily invests in building new facilities to meet demand and reduce backlogs. This strategy is well-aligned with Chinese government support for the tech and AI sectors, areas driving the growth of data center stocks.\r\n\r\nThe company remains undervalued relative to its potential. Its $8.09 billion enterprise value significantly exceeds its $2.15 billion market cap. This disparity helps explain analysts’ optimism, with all recent ratings recommending GDS stock as a buy. On average, price targets point to a 45% upside over the near term to $14.89 per share.\n\nVertiv (VRT) Abstract Futuristic infographic with Visual data complexity , represent Big data concept, node base programming. storage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVertiv (NASDAQ:VRT) provides critical digital infrastructure solutions as demand for data centers grows. The company designs and manufactures essential power management and cooling systems crucial for heat management. This includes advanced liquid cooling technologies that are becoming more prevalent as AI scales.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic investments in areas like AI and high-performance computing are expected to drive long-term demand for Vertiv. Data center spending is also growing substantially to support more digital services and complex data processing, which are integral to Vertiv’s business.\n\nVertiv has shown solid growth and execution. In its recent second quarter, the company posted EPS growth of 114.1% YOY and reported 12.6% revenue growth YOY. In addition, it raised its full-year outlook on strong demand and operations. The company has seen a 60% YOY increase in organic orders, largely from AI deployments.\n\nWith a record-high order backlog indicating future potential, Vertiv is well-positioned for continued growth. Analysts project an average price target of $105.37 per share, suggesting a 55% potential upside from current levels. This follows a 90% gain over the past year while it still trades 38% below its peak of $110 per share.\n\nSilicon Motion Techn ADR (SIMO) SIMO stock: Silicon Motion Technology logo on the side of its headquarters\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) manufactures solid-state memory drives that are key components used in data centers and other applications. The company expects its sales growth to be in the range of 25-30% this year. Recently, SIMO reported second-quarter earnings that showed a 15% sequential increase in quarterly revenue.\n\nShowing consistent revenue growth, Silicon Motion driven by strong demand for its NAND flash controllers and SSD solutions. For the full year 2024, it expects revenue between $800 million and $830 million, representing a 25% to 30% YOY increase. However, growth may be slightly delayed as the company implements new controller technology, after which it forecasts sales will return to increasing.\r\n\r\nSIMO stock trades at a relatively modest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.6 times compared to the sector average of 34.1 times. Analysts believe SIMO stock has strong future prospects, with 11 out of 14 recommending buying it. The average analyst price target is $93.89 per share, implying a potential upside of as much as 58%.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Apple",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) both posted their latest earnings reports on Aug. 1. Amazon's stock dipped after it missed analysts' revenue estimates and provided soft guidance for the current quarter, but Apple's stock held steady after it followed up its earnings beat with a stable near-term outlook.\n\nShould investors buy Apple and avoid Amazon? Let's take a fresh look at both companies' near-term challenges and valuations to find out. Image source: Amazon.\n\nWhy did Amazon's stock slump?\n\nAmazon's revenue rose 10% year over year to $148 billion in the second quarter of 2024 but missed analysts' expectations by $760 million. That revenue miss was caused by the slowing growth of its North American and international retail segments, which offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.\n\nGrowth by Segment (YOY) Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 North America revenue 11% 11% 13% 12% 9% International revenue 10% 16% 17% 10% 7% AWS revenue 12% 12% 13% 17% 19% Total revenue 11% 13% 14% 13% 10%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year.\n\nAmazon blamed its retail slowdown on tougher macro headwinds for consumer spending and lower average selling prices for bargain-hunting shoppers. It also said recent events -- including the U.S. presidential election, the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and the Paris Olympics -- were distracting shoppers and disrupting their online purchases.\n\nTougher competition from aggressive cross-border e-commerce competitors like Shein and PDD's Temu could be another major issue. All those challenges also throttled the growth of the company's integrated advertising services.\n\nOn the bright side, AWS' accelerating growth indicates the world's largest cloud platform continues to flourish -- even as it faces intense competition from Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. During the conference call, CEO Andy Jassy attributed a lot of that growth to the \"generative AI [artificial intelligence] boom,\" which is driving more companies to upgrade their cloud infrastructure services. AWS also has much higher operating margins than Amazon's e-commerce marketplaces, so it can still subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin businesses.\n\nAmazon expects its revenue to rise 8% to 11% year over year in the third quarter, but that midpoint missed analysts' estimates for 11% growth. For now, analysts expect the company's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 58%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy did Apple's stock hold steady?\n\nApple's revenue rose 5% year over year to $85.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29) and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.4 billion. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company generated 52% of its revenue from the iPhone, 24% of its revenue from services (including its App Store and subscription-based platforms), and the remaining 24% from its Macs, iPads, and wearables, home, and accessories segments.\n\nGrowth by Segment (YOY) Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 iPhone revenue (2%) 3% 6% (10%) (1%) Services revenue 8% 16% 11% 14% 14% Mac revenue (7%) (34%) 1% 4% 2% iPad revenue (20%) (10%) (25%) (17%) 24% Wearables, home, and accessories revenue 2% (3%) (11%) (10%) (2%) Total revenue (1%) (1%) 2% (4%) 5%\n\nData source: Apple. Fiscal year ends in September. YOY = Year over year.\n\nApple's services segment was the only business that consistently grew over the past year. But that closely watched segment, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers, faces unpredictable antitrust challenges in the U.S. and Europe as regulators probe its prioritization of first-party apps, developer restrictions, and high App Store fees.\n\nApple's iPhone sales slowed down as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. The company also faced tougher competition in China, and the strong dollar reduced overseas sales. But Mac sales -- which had experienced a growth spurt during the pandemic -- finally stabilized, as the company rolled out its new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Its iPad sales also finally rose again in the first quarter as the company launched the new iPad Air and iPad Pro.\n\nApple expects its growth to stabilize as it rolls out the iPhone 16 in September, ramps up expansion into India, and locks more users into its services ecosystem with a new batch of generative AI tools. It also continues to plow billions of dollars into its earnings-per-share (EPS) boosting buybacks. Analysts expect revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 16%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nThe valuations and verdict\n\nAmazon and Apple both face macro and competitive challenges, but the market seemed more disappointed by Amazon's slowing e-commerce sales than Apple's sluggish iPhone sales. Neither of these stocks is cheap right now. Amazon trades at 39 times forward earnings, while Apple has a slightly lower forward multiple of 30.\n\nI own both of these stocks, but I'm not in a hurry to add more shares or trim my existing positions. But if I had to buy more shares of one over the other right now, I'd pick Apple instead of Amazon. It trades at a lower multiple, faces fewer near-term challenges, and has more visible catalysts on the horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you “cry yourself to sleep.” Cramer said that this “nasty” selloff was expected.\n\n“It’s exactly what you’d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,” Cramer said.\n\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was “vicious enough” to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that’s exactly “what you have to do.” He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their “pants down” when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it’s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet “until we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.”\n\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn’t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he’d do it.\n\n“He’s got horse sense,” Cramer said.\n\nJim Cramer said there are no “safe havens” in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for “pain” in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\n“If you can’t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer is Talking About Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amid Global Selloff?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nJim Cramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  posted a “thin” top and bottom line beat despite “severe” in China.\n\n“Market is so negative on tech, they are not gonna give they benefit of the doubt, they never do,” Cramer said.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the limelight after the company posted decent quarterly results, where declines in iPhone sales were more than offset by services revenue and Mac sales gains. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock and increased his price target to $285 from $275.\n\n“Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence rollout has already begun with developers who will significantly enhance app capabilities as the company staggers the launch of its new AI feature along with its OpenAI partnership which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  expects ChatGPT and all other features to be integrated into the iPhone and other devices by the end of the year. We believe AI technology being introduced into the Apple ecosystem will bring monetization opportunities on both the services as well as iPhone/hardware front and adds $30 to $40 per share.” Ives said.\n\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog SPY, Apple and Micron Technology",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – August 7, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, Apple Inc. AAPL and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n2 Top S&P 500 Stocks to Buy on Market Dip: AAPL, MU\n\nWall Street has suffered a setback over the past few trading sessions as a weakening labor market and contraction in manufacturing activity raised apprehensions about a looming recession. Also, the surging Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar caused a “carry trade” and a market meltdown.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 3% on Monday and registered the largest percentage drop since Sep 13, 2022, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF also declined 2.9% in yesterday’s trading session. The broader index, in reality, declined 6.1% over the past three trading days, its largest three-day percentage drop since June 14, 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, closed at 38.57 on Monday, which is much above its long-term average of 20. However, astute investors shouldn’t shun equities completely amid the market mayhem. Instead, they should place bets on fundamentally sound stocks to meet their short-term and long-term obligations. After all, this is a temporary blip, and the market is all set to bounce back.\n\nNotably, the S&P 500 historically has rebounded a month, three months, and one year later following three successive falls of 1% or more, which it did in the last three trading sessions, per Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nJanus Henderson Investors research shows that during presidential election years the S&P 500 has posted an average annual return of 9.9%  (read more: 5 Growth Stocks to Buy for an Imposing Election Year Rally).\n\nMoreover, the service side of the economy is humming, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to trim interest rates as early as fall, which bodes well for the stock market.\n\nService Sector is Expanding\n\nImprovements in new orders helped the service side of the economy to expand in July. The ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI increased to 51.4% in July from June’s reading of 48.8%, the lowest since May 2020.\n\nThe PMI’s reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which could easily nullify recession anxieties. This is because the service sector accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed Rate Cut Soon\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell recently assured that the central bank will dial back on its aggressive monetary policy since monthly price pressures from year-ago levels have begun to subside and could decline further toward the Fed’s target of 2%.\n\nMost market participants expect a greater likelihood of a 50-basis-point (bps) reduction in interest rates in September instead of an earlier projection of a cut of 25 bps. Needless to say, interest rate cuts increase consumer outlays, reduce borrowing costs and boost economic growth (read more: Fed's September Rate Cut Bets Rise: NVDA, GOLD, PHM to Gain).\n\nHere’s Why AAPL, MU is Worth a Buy on the Dip\n\nSince activity in the service sector is growing despite Wall Street turbulence, things are looking good for tech behemoths such as Apple Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. in the long run. Interest rate cuts are a good omen for such tech players as their cash inflows aren’t hampered and can be utilized for research and development.\n\nSpectacular gowth in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year has been a blessing in disguise for Micron Technology, while Apple too recently joined the AI bandwagon (read more: Here's Why Apple is a Bullish Stock in a Tough August).\n\nWhile Apple is expected to benefit from planned iPhone sales discounts in China, Micron Technology is expected to do well due to the revival in DRAM demand. Also, let’s admit that these stocks were pretty pricey, but thanks to the dramatic fall in their prices recently, investors should essentially buy the stocks at a discount.\n\nApple shares down: Zacks rank (Buy)\n\nShares of the iPhone maker slumped 4.8% and 4.1%, respectively, on Monday and in the last five trading sessions. However, AAPL’s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company presently has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe average short-term price target of AAPL by brokerage firms increased 6.4% from the company’s last closing price of $219.86.\n\nMicron Technology shares dip, but strong growth score\n\nShares of the provider of semiconductor memory solutions fell 2.5% and 16.2%, respectively, on Monday and over the past five trading sessions. However, MU’s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 200.9% and 126.1%, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 company currently has a Growth Score of A. The average short-term price target of MU by brokerage firms surged 77.2% from the company’s last closing price of $92.70.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Sold $90 Billion of Apple Stock. Could This Be the Biggest Investing Mistake He's Ever Made?",
        "content": "It was the stock sale heard 'round the world.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Warren Buffett sold roughly $90 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares. This comes on the heels of Berkshire also selling blocks of its Apple stock in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWhat was Buffett thinking? And could selling so much Apple stock be the biggest investing mistake he's ever made?\n\nPossible good reasons for selling Apple\n\nLet's first look at why Buffett might have sold 390 million shares of Apple in Q2. Some could think the legendary investor has soured on the company. However, I don't believe that's the case.\n\nSure, Buffett wrote in his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders, \"[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\" The fact that he sold nearly half of Berkshire's stake in Apple in Q2 could seem to indicate that he no longer views the business or its management team as outstanding.\n\nBut Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May that American Express and Coca-Cola were \"wonderful business[es].\" He added, \"And we own Apple, which is an even better business.\" Buffett said this with Apple CEO Tim Cook sitting in the audience. The statement doesn't sound like the words of a man who doesn't like Apple's business or its management.\n\nPerhaps Buffett sold Apple because of valuation concerns. Maybe he wanted to increase Berkshire's cash stockpile (which now stands at nearly $277 billion) to buy a business that he thinks is an even better opportunity.\n\nOr possibly Buffett expects taxes to go up substantially in the future and selling now allows Berkshire to keep more profits. He hinted at this rationale at the Berkshire shareholder meeting.\n\nBuffett's biggest investing mistake?\n\nWhatever Buffett's reasons for selling Apple, could it be his biggest investing mistake ever? My answer to this question is: I don't know. I believe that's the best answer.\n\nDifferent investors can make different decisions about buying, holding, or selling any given stock. And their different decisions can be the right one for them.\n\nBefore Berkshire reported its Q2 results, Apple made up 43% of the conglomerate's total portfolio. As much as I like Apple (it's the biggest stock position in my portfolio), I wouldn't feel comfortable having it make up that high of a percentage of my holdings. However, Buffett didn't have a problem with having so much money invested in Apple for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe don't know what Buffett plans to do with the money raised from selling Berkshire's Apple stock. As I mentioned earlier, he could have what he thinks is a better investment opportunity in mind. It's never a mistake to sell a stock when you can put your money to better use.\n\nA better question\n\nAlthough I've focused so far on whether or not selling $90 billion of Apple stock could be Buffett's biggest investing mistake, I think there's a better question to ask. That question is: Will Apple continue to be a good stock to own for investors?\n\nThis is an important question for many investors -- including Buffett. Apple remains by far Buffett's biggest holding.\n\nIn my view, the answer to this question is a resounding \"yes.\" My confidence stems largely from Apple's new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nWedbush wrote to investors last week, \"Our view is betting against Cook and Cupertino into an AI-driven supercycle led by iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence is the wrong move for investors as the renaissance of growth returns to the Apple story.\" I agree with this take 100%.\n\nMaybe Buffett made a mistake by selling so much Apple stock; maybe he didn't. However, I think anyone who underestimates Apple right now is making a mistake that could cost them over the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nasdaq Market Correction: 1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Now, and Another to Avoid",
        "content": "Recession fears resurfaced last week when a disappointing jobs report raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates. That knocked the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) into correction territory, meaning the technology-heavy index has fallen at least 10% from its record high.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have suffered double-digit declines, though some have been hit harder than others. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) plunged 20% from its high, while Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has slipped just 11%. Investors may be tempted to buy the dip in both cases, but not every pullback is a buying opportunity.\n\nAmazon shares currently trade at a reasonable valuation, but Apple shares still look expensive. Here are the important details.\n\nAmazon: The Magnificent Seven stock worth buying right now\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in three large markets. It runs the most popular e-commerce marketplace, as measured by monthly visitors. It is the third-largest advertising company in the U.S., and eMarketer says Amazon could take second place from Meta Platforms by the end of the decade. Finally, Amazon Web Services is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, meaning it's ideally positioned to monetize artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAmazon reported mixed financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 10% to $148 billion, missing the $148.6 billion forecasted by Wall Street. But generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income surged 94% to $1.26 per share, topping the $1.03 per share analysts anticipated.\n\nUnfortunately, management also issued somewhat disappointing guidance. The company expects operating income to increase 18% in the third quarter, while analysts expected 37% growth. That shortfall contributed to the recent drawdown in the stock, but it creates an opportunity for patient investors.\n\nAmazon still has strong growth prospects in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Retail e-commerce sales and digital ad spending are expected to grow at annual rates of 8% and 10%, respectively, through 2027, according to eMarketer. Meanwhile, public cloud services revenue is forecasted to compound at 19% annually through 2028, according to IDC. That gives Amazon a good shot at double-digit sales growth in the coming years, which should translate into slightly faster earnings growth as the company continues to optimize operating costs.\n\nIndeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase at 23% annually through 2027. That makes the current valuation of 38.5 times earnings look reasonable. I say that because those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.7, a material discount to the three-year average of 2.9. Patient investors should feel confident buying a small position in Amazon today.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: The Magnificent Seven stock best avoided right now\n\nApple breaks its business into two revenue streams: products and services. The former includes revenue from consumer electronic devices like the iPhone, iPads, and Mac computers, while the latter includes revenue from the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud, and subscriptions offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. The company has a strong presence in several of those markets.\n\nApple consistently ranks second and fourth in quarterly smartphone and personal computer (PC) shipments, respectively. It operates the leading mobile app store, as measured by sales, and it has parlayed that leadership into a booming advertising business.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Pay is the leading in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers, and Apple TV+ recently overtook Paramount Global's Paramount+ as the sixth-most-popular streaming service in the U.S.\n\nYet, Apple is also beset by headwinds. The recently enacted Digital Markets Act could damage the dominance of its App Store in Europe by forcing the company to support third-party app stores. Additionally, Apple is losing smartphone market share to local competitors in China. Regional iPhone shipments fell 3% in the second quarter despite an acceleration in the broader market. That is concerning because China accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue last year.\n\nFinally, Apple lacks a clear-cut strategy where AI is concerned. It plans to introduce Apple Intelligence in October, bringing AI features to iPhones and MacBooks. But those features are free and, apart from potentially driving product upgrades, management has yet to detail plans for future monetization. Bloomberg has speculated that Apple will eventually charge for certain AI features, but whether consumers will pay is another question.\n\nApple reported modest financial results in the June quarter. Revenue rose 4.8% to $85.8 billion, and GAAP net income increased 7.6% to $21.4 billion. Active devices hit a record high across all products and geographic segments, services revenue climbed 14% to a record $24.2 billion, and gross margin expanded 180 basis points. In short, Apple is successfully drawing consumers to its hardware ecosystem and monetizing them with high-margin services.\n\nThe problem is valuation. Apple stock currently trades at 31.8 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 27.8 times earnings. That price tag looks especially expensive, given that Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 9% annually over the next three years.\n\nThat rich valuation may explain why Warren Buffett has slashed Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple in recent quarters. Investors should avoid this stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google’s unlawful grip on search could shatter its market dominance",
        "content": "The court ruling that Google is a “monopolist” could have ripple effects across the entire tech industry.\n\nA recent analyst note from Wedbush Securities lays out some of the possible scenarios. Some are more likely than others, and not all are favorable for Google—though some could be. The options on the table include a ban on the billions’ worth in exclusivity agreements Google struck with other companies, a massive fine, or the long-shot possibility that Apple seizes the opportunity to parachute into the search engine business itself, potentially with a formidable player like OpenAI, according to Wedbush.\n\nFor consumers, the end of “Let me google that for you,” a term that officially became a verb in 2006, could mean that it will ultimately be easier for them to access other search engines. But just because access is easier doesn’t mean Google’s business will evaporate. Consumers could simply choose it over competitors. However, if Google’s position were to slip, it could open the door to other search engines now that they could more fairly compete.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Amit Mehta of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google acted as a monopoly by using its position as the market-leading search engine to unfairly harm its smaller competitors. In the ruling, Mehta said Google had used its size and influence to secure exclusivity deals that made its search engine the default setting. In 2021, Google spent a total of $26 billion securing these agreements through revenue-sharing deals with smartphone makers like Apple, various wireless carriers, and web browser developers, according to Mehta’s ruling.\n\nIn his 286-page brief, Mehta acknowledged Google’s superior product, calling it “the industry’s highest-quality search engine.”\n\nGoogle pointed to this fact in its reaction to the ruling, which it plans to appeal. “This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available,” Google president for global affairs Kent Walker said.\n\nThe agreements Google signed with other companies paid off handsomely—in 2023 Google Search raked in $175 billion in revenue—keeping competitors off consumers’ devices. In 2020, Google had a 95% market share on smartphones and a 90% share of online search in general, according to Mehta’s ruling. Microsoft-owned Bing, the runner-up, had just 6% of all searches, the court filings stated.\n\nWith an appeal pending and the fact Mehta hasn’t yet decided what penalties he will impose on Google, there are a few possible outcomes in the running. They range from maintaining the status quo to upending the search industry all together, according to Wedbush’s analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat could happen to Google?\n\nThe most straightforward outcome is if Google wins its appeal. In that case, the current ruling would be overturned and things would stay as they are. Google has about a 30% to 40% chance of winning its appeal, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives’s estimate. The appeal will likely take months if not years to play out and until then things could be in a holding pattern.\n\nIf Google loses the appeal, Mehta would impose a penalty that either forces the company to pay a fine, change the way it does business, or both. Google could be hit with a fine, which would likely have little effect on Google’s business, especially if the agreements allowing it to remain the default search engine stayed in place, said Wedbush’s analysts. It’s also old hat for the $2 trillion tech giant and others like it. In the EU, Google was hit with a $2.7 billion fine in June 2017 for violating newly implemented tech regulations by the EU’s antitrust watchdog. In the U.S., other tech companies have been hit with similar multibillion-dollar fines by other antitrust regulators. In 2019, the FTC slapped Meta with a $5 billion fine for violating privacy regulations.\n\nWhat would be a hit to Google’s business is if the government forced smartphone companies to proactively offer consumers the option to change their default search engine. Wedbush called this a “net negative outcome” even though it expected most users would continue to stick with Google.\n\nIn this case, Google’s appeal would end in a sort of middle ground, where it kept its agreements but under certain conditions, according to Dan Ives. He likened it to Microsoft’s famous antitrust case from 2001 where after an appeal the company was allowed to stay together but had to offer competitors access to its APIs, something it had previously resisted.\n\n“If they lose, they likely come to some structured agreement with Apple that would tightrope everything,” Ives said. And “give [consumers] some other options from a search perspective on the iOS iPhone ecosystem, but still keep Google as the primary search partner.”\n\nOther analysts also consider this to be a possibility.\n\nEvercore analyst Amit Daryanani said one of the most likely outcomes is a ruling that would require that “companies like Apple must proactively prompt users to select their search engine rather than setting a default and allowing consumers to make changes in settings if they wish.”\n\nGoogle’s agreements with companies like Apple ensures that devices don’t come preloaded with other search engines. There’s a strong possibility that could change and that upon buying a new device, users will be prompted with the option to select a default search engine from a list of choices.\n\nThere are also two less likely scenarios. In one, companies like Apple, now unencumbered by lucrative but restrictive default agreements, simply replace Google with a different search engine. Wedbush doesn’t see that happening because Google is widely considered to be the best search engine on the market.\n\nThe second unlikely scenario is that Apple uses this as an opportunity to start developing its own competitor to Google.\n\nIf done properly, Apple could seamlessly integrate an AI search tool across its countless devices across the world, says Jim Kaskade, CEO of Conversica, a cloud company developing conversation AI. “This is a potentially big win and will help unseat Google’s dominance,” he said.\n\nOne of the reasons for Google’s big money deal with Apple was to keep it from developing its own search tools, according to New York Times reporting from 2023. Apple and Google already compete in the smartphone market with their iOS and Android systems.\n\nIn closing, the Wedbush note floats a partnership between two of Google’s major tech competitors. Apple and OpenAI could team up to develop a next-generation, AI-powered search engine. It’s a long-shot possibility, Ives concedes, but an option nonetheless. “There’s probably a better chance of me running the 200 meter in Paris than that happening, but you just got to put every option out there,” he said.\n\nThe two companies already have an agreement to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool into Apple’s existing Siri features, which it is calling Apple Intelligence. While unlikely, Wedbush concedes that if it did happen it could be a big hit to Google. “An unexpected challenge from Apple could result in more material market share loss from Google,” the research note reads.\n\nBut Apple, a famously fastidious company, is reportedly keeping OpenAI at arm’s length over concerns about consumer privacy and its brand image.\n\nKaskade says all of this is still premature. “Let’s not mix the ruling and associated challenges with go-to-market and product technology breakthroughs of these two,” he said. “The ruling applies no matter how Google and Apple compete.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A judge has branded Google a monopolist, but AI may bring about quicker change in internet search",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal judge has branded Google as a ruthless monopolist bent on suffocating it competitors. But how do you go about creating alternatives to a search engine that's synonymous with internet exploration?\n\nIt's a process that may take years to unfold as Google appeals the landmark decision issued Monday by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta.\n\nAnd with that kind of time frame looming, the forces of technological upheaval may make the exercise moot.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence may reshape the landscape more quickly and profoundly than any judge ever could. The way consumers navigate the internet is more likely to be affected by advances in AI products — such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's own Gemini — before a nearly 4-year-old case brought by the U.S. Justice Department is finally resolved.\n\nEven so, Mehta's 277-page ruling Monday creates challenges for Google that company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin probably didn't envision when they set out to revolutionize internet search while attending Stanford University as graduate students. They eventually dropped out to start a Silicon Valley company in 1998 that adopted “Don't Be Evil” as a motto that also was meant to serve as its corporate conscience.\n\nPage and Brin, who remain the controlling shareholders of Google's corporate parent Alphabet Inc., also cast their cuddly startup as a crusader for technology that would be far better than the products coming out of Microsoft, the industry's reigning kingpin at the time. Microsoft's dominance of personal computer software and anticompetitive tactics during the 1990s spurred another Justice Department case that ended up hobbling Microsoft and helped make it easier for Google to build its lead in search and then expand into maps, cloud computing, email (Gmail), web browsers (Chrome) and video (YouTube).\n\nNow, the script has been flipped, with Google facing potential legal constraints, while a resurgent Microsoft has been making early headway in AI with a major helping hand from its investment in OpenAI. In one of the most dramatic scenarios that most experts think is unlikely to happen, Google might be forced to break up its business similar to how AT&T — once known as “Ma Bell” — ended up spinning off its telephone subsidiaries into separate “Baby Bells” more than 40 years ago.\n\nIt will be left to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who took over the company's leadership from Page in 2015, to minimize the distractions caused by the legal skirmishing still to come and remain focused on an industrywide pivot to AI technology that's expected to be as revolutionary as the mobile computing shift by Apple's introduction of the iPhone in 2007.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe debate about how Google should be overhauled will begin Sept. 6 with a hearing scheduled in Washington, D.C., before Mehta, who also presided over the 10-week trial last year that led to his antitrust decision.\n\nGoogle also will be pursing an appeal, based on its long-held contention that it has done nothing wrong but build and maintain a search engine that has been far superior to anything else for more than 20 years. The Mountain View, California, company also maintains that competition is just a few clicks away, with consumers still free to go to other options, such as Microsoft's Bing, DuckDuckGo and, more recently, AI-powered alternatives such as Perplexity and ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough Mehta praised the quality of Google's search engine in his ruling and acknowledged the company initially became the people's preferred choice in its early days, he concluded it resorted to unfair tactics to maintain its leadership during the past decade. Google did it, Mehta said, mainly by negotiating lucrative deals to cement a position as the default search engine on the iPhone and wide range of other devices, including PCs.\n\nThose deals, which totaled $26 billion in 2021 alone, meant Google automatically processed search requests unless consumers took the time to manually go into their settings and choose another option — something that few do. The default option then helped Google collect valuable insights that enabled the company to improve its search engine in ways that rivals couldn't because they lacked the same data.\n\nDefault requests processed accounted for 60% of Google's search traffic in 2017, Mehta pointed out in his ruling, and that volume in turn created more opportunities to sell the ads that generate the majority of its parent company's $307 billion in annual revenue.\n\nMehta's focus on the default search deals in his ruling make it likely he may decide to ban them after the next trial phase is completed, according to antitrust experts. That could have implications for other companies besides Google, especially Apple, which pockets about $20 billion annually from an arrangement that is currently scheduled to continue through 2026, with options to extend the alliance into 2028.\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment about Mehta's decision, but its executives have depicted the decision to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and other products as a convenience to its customers — most of whom prefer to use Google.\n\nBut an order preventing Apple from doing default search engine deals with Google could do more than just siphon away revenue. It might also require Apple to spend heavily to develop its own search technology — an endeavor that Google estimated would cost more than $30 billion as part of 2020 analysis that Mehta cited in his ruling. Then, it would cost Apple an additional $7 billion annually to sustain its own search engine, according to Google's analysis.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A Microsoft victory and Mozilla defeat: The fallout from Google’s antitrust saga",
        "content": "Google had a bad day on Monday. A federal judge ruled in the first major antitrust case against big tech in over two decades that Google has an illegal monopoly on the search market. As a result of its pervasive presence on phones and browsers, the tech company was able to hike advertisement rates with few consequences. According to the Department of Justice, Google paid $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine for the masses.\n\n“Google’s distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search services market and impair rivals’ opportunities to compete,” judge Amit Mehta said in the case’s 286-page ruling.\n\nWith Google’s $2 trillion parent company Alphabet a force to be reckoned with in the tech world,\n\nthe outcome of the case is bound to cascade beyond Google and its users. As the dust settled on the case, tech and antitrust experts said the lawsuit could have plenty of ripples on entities in the tech industry—for better or for worse. Here are the winners and losers they identified.\n\nThe winners\n\nWhile the DOJ is the obvious victor in the case’s ruling, the Federal Trade Commission—which is currently embroiled in lawsuits with other big tech companies like Apple, and readying antitrust probes into Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI—could also benefit from the case, according to George Hay, a senior law professor at Cornell University. The FTC’s approach now is a departure from the era of the 1990s and 2000s during a period of rapid innovation, when the regulatory body took years to crack down on the meteoric rise of tech monopolies.\n\n“It suggests that the court is willing to take on a dominant firm and explain why it's so dominant and attribute some antitrust liability to some reason for dominance,” he told Fortune.\n\nBut despite the Justice Department getting a favorable ruling, Adam Kovacevich, former Google policy director and founder of the tech coalition Chamber of Progress, told Fortune that tech will continue to win big, likely crowning Microsoft as the case’s biggest winner.\n\n“The thing about big tech antitrust crusades is that the big winner, many times, is another big tech company,” he said.\n\nAs a result of the suit, Google could be prohibited from bidding in default deals, Kovacevich said, leaving the door open for other search engines to take advantage. Because of Microsoft’s power and influence in the industry—to the tune of a $3 trillion market capitalization—it should have no problem securing its search engine Bing as the default for some major platforms, Kovacevich argued.\n\nMicrosoft has openly expressed this as a goal. CEO Satya Nadella testified in Google’s antitrust case in 2023, saying how hard it was to strike a deal with Apple to replace Google as its default browser. Though Bing lacks a robust usership compared to Google, Nadella promised in his testimony the company would be able to invest more in the engine.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s also a symbolic victory for Microsoft, which, 23 years ago, lost the last major federal antitrust case. In 2000, the DOJ ruled Microsoft violated antitrust laws through the restrictions it put on PC manufacturers. But Microsoft came out relatively unscathed: After George W. Bush became president in 2001, the company had the opportunity to settle the suit. Microsoft was also able to avoid splitting into two companies, the original request of the judge. But despite dodging a bullet in the remedy stage of the case, there’s still a desire from the juggernaut to stay on top and give other big tech companies a taste of what it experienced, Kovacevich said.\n\n“Basically for 20 years now, Microsoft's position has been, ‘We didn't agree with the government, but this is what they did to us, and so they should do the same thing to Google,’” he said.\n\nMicrosoft declined Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nWith the potential for big tech to be humbled, Luther Lowe, head of public policy at startup accelerator Y Combinator, believes the impending remedies could benefit tech startups unable to previously compete with Google’s massive resources.\n\n“This ruling could significantly reshape the competitive landscape to benefit ‘little tech’ by reducing Google's gatekeeping power & creating more open competition in search & digital advertising,” he wrote on X.\n\nKovacevich isn’t so sure. While smaller search engine sites like DuckDuckGo may have less competition, depending on the remedies from the case, it’s a long shot for it to be able to increase its market share. Because these smaller tech companies lack Microsoft and Google’s funding, their products simply aren't as strong or user-friendly.\n\n“But how do you force consumers to choose a certain inferior search engine?” Kovacevich said.\n\nDuckDuckGo told Fortune in a statement it does offer a competitive search engine alternative and applauded the DOJ’s decision in the antitrust case.\n\n“We’ve passed a key milestone, but there’s still a lot of history to be written and Google will do anything it can to get in the way of progress which is why we hope to see a robust remedies trial that can really dig into all the details, propose an array of remedies that will actually work, and set up a monitoring body to administer them,” the company said.\n\nThe losers\n\nThe ruling of Google’s suit could have a big impact on Samsung and Apple, which have shelled out on deals to have Google as their default search engines. Apple paid $20 billion in 2022 alone to have Google as Safari’s default search bar. Mehta argued in the hearing those agreements were detrimental to competition, accounting for 94.9% of the search market. Following the ruling, the future of these deals are unclear.\n\nBut while both tech companies—and Apple in particular—may appear to be most directly impacted by the outcome of the antitrust case, the biggest loser is likely Mozilla, Kovacevich said. When users type in search queries into Mozilla’s Firefox browser, it reroutes them to Google. Mozilla’s deal with Google is incredibly lucrative, making up $510 million of its $593 million in revenue, according to its 2021-2022 financial statements. It also heavily relies on Google’s participation in bidding wars over default deals, according to Kovacevich. If Google is no longer able to participate in default deals, there’s less incentive for replacement candidates like Microsoft to want to pay as much for platforms to use Bing. That could impact Mozilla’s financial dependence on Google, with lower bids and less revenue for Mozilla.\n\n“What Mozilla was benefiting from was the bidding war between Google, and so I think that is almost certainly going to go away,” Kovacevich said.\n\nMozilla said it's closely reviewing the case to examine its impact on the company.\n\n“Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,” a spokesperson told Fortunein a statement on Monday. “Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users’ preferences while fostering a competitive market.”\n\nWith rumblings of potential default search engine changes, there’s also potential for users perfectly happy with Google’s massive search bar presence to be inconvenienced. And the outsized consequence could be that people grow frustrated with other platforms, and leave them altogether.\n\nThere’s past precedent for a user revolt. In 2014, Mozilla switched its Firefox default search tool from Google to Yahoo as part of a $375 million five-year-deal. The quality of the experience with Yahoo paled in comparison to its competitor, however, and users simply left the browser. Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker called it a “failed” bet, and by the end of 2017, Mozilla had reverted its default browser back to Google\n\nPrecedent and evidence aside, the shakeout to determine the true winners and losers of the case will take months, Hay warned. Google will appeal the decision, Kent Walker, president of global affairs said in a statement to Fortune, with a separate DOJ hearing to discuss remedies scheduled for September. Until then, Google has “no real incentive to change behavior,” according to Hay.\n\n“Nothing's going to happen for quite a while,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google antitrust ruling may pose $20 billion risk for Apple",
        "content": "By Aditya Soni\n\n(Reuters) - Apple's lucrative deal with Google could be under threat after a U.S. judge ruled that the Alphabet-owned search giant was operating an illegal monopoly.\n\nA potential remedy for Google to avoid antitrust actions could involve terminating the agreement, which makes its search engine a default on Apple devices, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle pays Apple $20 billion annually, or about 36% of what it earns from search advertising made through the Safari browser, for the privilege, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\nIf the deal is undone, the iPhone maker could take a 4-6% hit to its profit, the analysts estimated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pact runs until at least September 2026 and Apple has the right to unilaterally extend it for another two years, according to media reports in May that cited a document filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case.\n\n\"The most likely outcome now is the judge rules Google must no longer pay for default placement or that companies like Apple must proactively prompt users to select their search engine rather than setting a default and allowing consumers to make changes in settings if they wish,\" Evercore ISI analysts said.\n\nApple's shares were trading flat on Tuesday, underperforming a recovery in the broader market after Monday's global selloff. Alphabet was little changed, after falling 4.5% in the previous session.\n\n\"The message here is that if you've got a dominant market position with a product, you'd better avoid the use of exclusive agreements and make sure any agreement you make gives the buyer free choice to substitute away,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTo be sure, the \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI TILT\n\nStill, if the tie-up is scrapped, Apple will have several options including offering customers alternatives such as Microsoft Bing to customers, or potentially a new search product powered by OpenAI.\n\nAnalysts agree that the ruling will speed up Apple's move towards AI-powered search services. It recently announced that it would bring OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot to its devices.\n\nIn a shift away from exclusive deals that would help Apple ward off regulatory scrutiny, the company has said it is also in talks with Google to add the Gemini chatbot and plans to add other AI models as well.\n\nApple is also revamping Siri with AI technology, giving it more control to handle tasks that had proven tricky in the past such as writing emails and interacting with messages.\n\nWhile those efforts are expected to make little money in the coming years, they could help capitalize on the new technology.\n\n\"Apple could see this as a temporary setback, especially since it earns a lot from the Google search deal, but it is also an opportunity for them to pivot to AI solutions for search,\" said Gadjo Sevilla, analyst at Emarketer.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Priyanka G in Bengaluru and Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Anil D'Silva)",

        "title": "3 Moves to Make as Investors Pivot Away From Tech and Into The Dow",
        "content": "The latest decision by the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady is not doing any favors to the stock market overall. The decision to do nothing is stoking fears of a recession, sending broad market indices lower in the process. That said, tech continues to lead the way, and the relative safety of the Dow is coming into sharper focus. As I write this, the Nasdaq Composite is down 2.3%, with the Dow falling by a relatively modest 1.2%.\n\nThat’s a continuation of recent trends that have seen investors trim their positions across the tech sector in favor of safety. Renewed recessionary fears suggest investors will continue to head in that direction and seek the relative safety of the Dow.\n\nIn turn, share prices should rise on increasing demand. That raises the question of which moves investors should make as the pivot into greater relative safety continues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Can of Coca-Cola, a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is considered to be a defensive stock and is rising as I write this. The stock has gained over 7% in the last 20 days and remains under its consensus target price. Part of the recent price surge is due to the aforementioned pivot but also Coca-Cola’s sponsorship of the Paris Olympics.\n\nCoca-Cola’s CEO noted that the company recently upped its guidance, which could surprise some. He noted that while the low-end consumer in both the United States and China continues to come under pressure due to inflation and other factors, pricing for premium products has more than made up for the shortfall.\n\nAnalysts continue to rally behind Coca-Cola following a recent earnings beat in which better-than-expected margins outpaced the negative effects of higher SG&A expenses. Coca-Cola continues to prove it is an earnings machine capable of operating in just about any environment, and it is likely to see increasing demand in the coming weeks for just that reason.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nIt’s a great time to consider moving more heavily into McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock. It’s certainly a contrarian position, given McDonald’s second-quarter sales fell for the first time in almost four years.\n\nMcDonald’s has been hard hit by inflation. The company raised prices, and consumers fought back, opting to avoid the golden arches at rates not seen for years. McDonald’s has responded by reintroducing value meals and remains a value leader in the consciousness of many.\n\nThat said, second-quarter earnings came in at $2.97, well below the $3.07 expected on Wall Street. McDonald’s blamed the weakness on increasing prices throughout its supply chain, among other factors. Regardless, that poor performance has sent McDonald’s shares much lower, and they now are flirting with low target price territory.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn my mind, that creates the opportunity to establish a position or increase it. Investors will continue to receive dividends and we’ll have to wait and see how effective McDonald’s turnaround strategy will be.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been playing catch-up in relation to artificial intelligence (AI). It is a relative laggard amongst the tech giants when it comes to AI. The company only recently revealed its plans for its AI services known as Apple Intelligence at the June Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Although it was far later to the game than its competition, that sent stock prices higher.\n\nThey have recently stumbled due to the greater tech sell-off.\n\nThen, on August 1, Apple released its third-quarter earnings report. That report showed the company is essentially flat, with a slight bump in sales over the last three and nine months, respectively.\n\niPhone sales are down slightly in each of those periods, which is of paramount importance to Apple.\n\nThe iPhone 16 is slated to be released in September. It remains to be seen whether AI functionality will be included in the release. Regardless, Apple could see a spike in sales, especially given the expectation of rate cuts at the same time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Top S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy on Market Dip: AAPL, MU",
        "content": "Wall Street has suffered a setback over the past few trading sessions as a weakening labor market and contraction in manufacturing activity raised apprehensions about a looming recession. Also, the surging Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar caused a “carry trade” and a market meltdown.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 3% on Monday and registered the largest percentage drop since Sep 13, 2022, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY also declined 2.9% in yesterday’s trading session. The broader index, in reality, declined 6.1% over the past three trading days, its largest three-day percentage drop since June 14, 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, closed at 38.57 on Monday, which is much above its long-term average of 20. However, astute investors shouldn’t shun equities completely amid the market mayhem. Instead, they should place bets on fundamentally sound stocks to meet their short-term and long-term obligations. After all, this is a temporary blip, and the market is all set to bounce back.\n\nNotably, the S&P 500 historically has rebounded a month, three months, and one year later following three successive falls of 1% or more, which it did in the last three trading sessions, per Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nS&P 500’s 3+ Days of 1% Decline Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Dow Jones Market Data\n\nJanus Henderson Investors research shows that during presidential election years the S&P 500 has posted an average annual return of 9.9%  (read more: 5 Growth Stocks to Buy for an Imposing Election Year Rally).\n\nMoreover, the service side of the economy is humming, and the Federal Reserve is widely expected to trim interest rates as early as fall, which bodes well for the stock market.\n\nService Sector is Expanding\n\nImprovements in new orders helped the service side of the economy to expand in July. The ISM’s non-manufacturing PMI increased to 51.4% in July from June’s reading of 48.8%, the lowest since May 2020.\n\nThe PMI’s reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, which could easily nullify recession anxieties. This is because the service sector accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.\n\nFed Rate Cut Soon\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell recently assured that the central bank will dial back on its aggressive monetary policy since monthly price pressures from year-ago levels have begun to subside and could decline further toward the Fed’s target of 2%.\n\nMost market participants expect a greater likelihood of a 50-basis-point (bps) reduction in interest rates in September instead of an earlier projection of a cut of 25 bps. Needless to say, interest rate cuts increase consumer outlays, reduce borrowing costs and boost economic growth (read more: Fed's September Rate Cut Bets Rise: NVDA, GOLD, PHM to Gain).\n\nStory continues\n\nHere’s Why AAPL, MU is Worth a Buy on the Dip\n\nSince activity in the service sector is growing despite Wall Street turbulence, things are looking good for tech behemoths such as Apple Inc. AAPL and Micron Technology, Inc. MU in the long run. Interest rate cuts are a good omen for such tech players as their cash inflows aren’t hampered and can be utilized for research and development.\n\nSpectacular growth in artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year has been a blessing in disguise for Micron Technology, while Apple too recently joined the AI bandwagon (read more: Here's Why Apple is a Bullish Stock in a Tough August).\n\nWhile Apple is expected to benefit from planned iPhone sales discounts in China, Micron Technology is expected to do well due to the revival in DRAM demand. Also, let’s admit that these stocks were pretty pricey, but thanks to the dramatic fall in their prices recently, investors should essentially buy the stocks at a discount.\n\nApple shares down: Zacks rank (Buy)\n\nShares of the iPhone maker slumped 4.8% and 4.1%, respectively, on Monday and in the last five trading sessions. However, AAPL’s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 8.2% and 8.3%, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company presently has a Growth Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe average short-term price target of AAPL by brokerage firms increased 6.4% from the company’s last closing price of $219.86. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron Technology shares dip, but strong growth score\n\nShares of the provider of semiconductor memory solutions fell 2.5% and 16.2%, respectively, on Monday and over the past five trading sessions. However, MU’s expected earnings growth for the current quarter and year is 200.9% and 126.1%, respectively.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 company currently has a Growth Score of A. The average short-term price target of MU by brokerage firms surged 77.2% from the company’s last closing price of $92.70.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) illegally sustained search and text advertising monopolies.\n\nThis ruling is a notable triumph for the Department of Justice, led by Jonathan Kanter.\n\nAntitrust regulators accused Google’s parent company of preserving its monopoly in online search and advertising by paying $26 billion to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics, and other smartphone manufacturers over several decades for prominent placement on browsers and mobile devices.\n\nThis lawsuit was in addition to two DOJ antitrust cases against Google, alleging that the company illegally fortified its monopolies.\n\nAlso Read: Google Antitrust Crusade Was Spearheaded By Jonathan Kanter, Who Is The Attorney Taking On Tech Giants Like Apple And Amazon\n\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin reiterated Alphabet stock a Buy rating with a price forecast of $210.\n\nIn the long term, Alphabet’s strategic position is best-in-class, the analyst writes.\n\nThe company’s $237 billion in global ad revenue for 2023 accounted for 38% of worldwide digital ad spending, eMarketer reports. In digital markets, which tend to favor dominant players, Alphabet has emerged as a clear winner, Martin highlights.\n\nThe analyst views Alphabet’s breakup as beneficial, noting its parts are ‘worth’ more individually than as a whole.\n\nAccording to Martin, the EU will likely mandate Alphabet to spin off its third-party network ad business.\n\nYouTube would be valued at $455 billion-$643 billion if separately traded.\n\nThe analyst writes that if Alphabet is broken up, its shares would likely appreciate for several reasons.\n\nInvestors value pure-play assets more because they can better manage risk exposure than conglomerates.\n\nIncreased transparency from separate entities would meet materiality standards, offering more detailed data to investors, Martin adds. Employee retention might improve as staff receive stock in the company they can influence directly.\n\nA breakup would also increase capital allocation accountability to Wall Street.\n\nAdditionally, by reducing its size through spin-offs, Alphabet could lower regulatory risks and potential fines, as regulators often target “Big Tech” based on market cap.\n\nMartin expects the company to report EPS of $7.62 in FY24.\n\nPrice Action: GOOG shares are trading higher by 0.31% to $161.13 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nRead Next:\n\nBoeing Poised for Free Cash Flow Surge Post-2024, Optimism Fueled by Production and New CEO: Goldman Sachs\n\nPhoto by DenPhotos on Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for GOOGL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Feb 2022 MKM Partners Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Mizuho Maintains Buy Feb 2022 Piper Sandler Maintains Overweight\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\n\nStory continues\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google Parent Alphabet's Breakup Could Boost Stock Value, Citing Higher Investor Appeal For Pure-Play Assets: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

The legendary investor’s company now holds 400 million AAPL shares worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nApart from Apple, BRK.B also reduced its stake at Bank of America BAC to $41.1 billion. Roughly 72% of Berkshire’s holdings are concentrated in only five stocks: Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca Cola KO and Chevron.\r\n\r\nThe sharp sell-off is unlikely of Buffett who is known to hold onto stocks for a very long time. The reduction in stake led to an increase in Berkshire’s cash balance to roughly $277 billion, a move partially to lower capital gain tax as mentioned by Buffett in May. \r\n\r\nHowever, Buffett's followers know that he loves cash in hand as substantial cash allows the company to do whatever it wants. Hence, the question is, should an investor follow Buffett’s move to sell off Apple shares or should pile up more at current prices?\n\nApple Stock Overvalued, Underperforms Sector\n\nThe Value Style Score of D suggests that AAPL is overvalued at this moment.\r\n\r\nApple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 28.37X compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 24.49X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nPrice/Earnings Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn terms of performance, Apple shares have gained 9.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.3%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Apple shares are trading below the 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.\n\nApple Shares Trade Below 50-Day Moving Average Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past month, Apple shares have declined 7.6%, outperforming the sector’s drop of 14.1%. We believe the dip presents a significant opportunity for investors to pile up on AAPL shares, given the iPhone maker’s growing focus on leveraging AI in its devices.\n\nYTD Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL’s Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple has been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of Generative AI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nStory continues\n\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware and capable of handling complex tasks. \r\n\r\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nServices Business: Cash Cow for AAPL Stock\n\nAlthough Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged as the company’s new cash cow. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content as well as the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. \r\n\r\nNew updates include the U.S. national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ to boost user experience.\n\nSolid Liquidity Supports AAPL’s Dividend\n\nApple’s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Jun 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $153.04 billion compared with term debt of $98.31 billion. \r\n\r\nApple returned nearly $32 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.9 billion) and share repurchases ($26 billion). \r\n\r\nAAPL’s board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL’s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+, Apple Pay and Apple Arcade. \r\n\r\nAn expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple’s investment profile attractive. Its strong liquidity position will help AAPL stock to sustain its shareholder-friendly initiatives.\r\n\r\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become known for launching products that make a splash. That led to large revenue and profit growth that fueled share price gains, creating a lot of wealth for long-term shareholders. The business has a market capitalization of over $3 trillion, putting it in rarefied company.\n\nNarrowing the time frame, how much money would you have if you had invested $5,000 in Apple shares five years ago?\n\nWealth creator\n\nApple's stock, selling for about $50 five years ago, closed Monday at $209 after a pullback following the news that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) sold about half of its stake in the company during the second quarter. Notably, share prices and returns take into account the 4-for-1 stock split in 2020. That translates into a share price gain of 310% during this time, easily outpacing the S&P 500 index's 76.9% gain.\n\nYou also would've collected dividends during this span that would have boosted your total return to 346.5%, more than triple the S&P 500's 97.9%. Combining the price gain and dividends, your initial $5,000 investment would've more than quadrupled to over $22,000.\n\nWhile you could have sold and locked in nice gains, Apple investors' patience has been handsomely rewarded. For instance, selling after three years would've resulted in a 52% return and you would've received over $7,600 in proceeds. That means you would've missed large returns over the past couple of years.\n\nIs further patience warranted? Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, well known for his longtime investing horizon, seems willing to take profits.\n\nApple's shares sell at a 35 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a premium to the S&P 500's 29 multiple.\n\nHence, the market has high expectations for the company's profitability growth. I'm cautious given Apple faces more intense competition for its core iPhone product, which accounts for about half of its sales. In the latest quarter, iPhone sales fell 0.9% to $39.3 billion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Google monopoly ruling could help Apple defense in antitrust case",
        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - Apple could be the winner after Alphabet's Google lost its fight with the U.S. antitrust enforcers earlier this week, with a ruling that supports the iPhone maker's defense in its own antitrust court battle with U.S. prosecutors, legal experts said.\n\nA federal judge mostly sided with state and federal antitrust enforcers in the blockbuster case on Monday that ruled Google's search business was an illegal monopoly, but threw out a claim by several U.S. states that one of Google's ad tools was designed to give the company an advantage over Microsoft's Bing.\n\nThat piece could help Apple's defense in its own anti-monopoly case, experts said.\n\nThe ruling underscored Supreme Court precedent that companies almost never have a \"duty to deal\" with their rivals, said Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.\n\n\"Any case, including Apple, in which a duty to deal is a major portion, is going to get a close look,\" he said.\n\nThe states had claimed Google thwarted competition by failing to offer key features for rivals' ads through Search Ads 360, a tool for managing marketing campaigns across multiple search engines.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed with Google that it was not required to spur competition by accommodating its rival.\n\n\"Their claim requires grappling with a host of questions that the court is ill-equipped to handle,\" the judge said.\n\nThat part of the ruling is good for defendants, said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School and former commissioner of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\"It also is a reminder that the case is hardly finished,\" he said, adding that the case and appeals could take years.\n\nTo be sure, Apple could ultimately lose billions of dollars because of the Google case if the judge bans the search juggernaut from paying the iPhone maker and others to be the default search engine on their devices.\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\nBut the Google ruling could give Apple a boost in its case where the Justice Department says it hampered the development of third-party apps and devices.\n\nThe company last week asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that putting reasonable limitations on third-party developers' access to its technology did not amount to anti-competitive behavior, and that forcing it to share technology with competitors would chill innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe judge in Apple's case need not follow Mehta's ruling, though Apple may try to use it to persuade him.\n\nThe Justice Department will have to show Apple's interactions with developers were more like Google's payments to device makers, Hovenkamp said.\n\n\"In order to win, the government is going to have to point to some kind of agreement, because then the standard becomes more aggressive,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "We know the Google antitrust ruling is huge, but we don’t know what it really means yet",
        "content": "Yesterday’s Google antitrust ruling was historic.\n\nIt may be kind of obvious to most people that a company handling 90% or more of search queries in the U.S. is a monopolist, but it’s nonetheless a big deal for a judge to rule as such—and to confirm that Google was therefore breaking antitrust rules when it shored up that outsized position by paying billions to Apple, Samsung and other players to make Google Search the default on their devices.\n\nThis, and U.S. judge Amit Mehta’s finding that Google’s monopolistic position has allowed it to charge excessive prices for search text ads, constitute the biggest outcome in U.S. tech antitrust history since the Microsoft ruling nearly quarter of a century ago. It will most likely have a big impact. But we are far from knowing what that impact will be, because Mehta is yet to lay out how Google must fix things—and this next part of the proceedings could come within six months, or it could be delayed for a long time by Google’s promised appeal.\n\nSo, for now, we have to play the conjecture game.\n\nGiven the fact that exclusive default-search payments are at the core of the case, it is quite possible that Mehta will demand their end. That would represent a hit to the bottom lines of the companies Google has been paying; Apple alone has been making as much as $20 billion a year out of this scheme. As my colleague Jason Del Rey wrote yesterday, Firefox-maker Mozilla in particular faces an existential threat in this scenario, as it is almost entirely funded by payments for making Google its default search engine.\n\nBut it’s very unclear how things might change for consumers as a result of yesterday’s ruling.\n\nMehta may merely tell Google to start sharing its search data with rival search providers, which could promote competition in the sector without users seeing much that's different.\n\nIt is possible that people will be presented with a search engine choice when firing up their browser for the first time—Google already does this in Chrome in Europe, to comply with new antitrust laws there. It could be that Apple will start offering its own search engine in Safari, though this would cost billions to develop, and it’s just as likely that there would be an opening for Microsoft’s Bing on the iPhone, or perhaps the search engine that’s being developed by new Apple partner OpenAI.\n\nWhatever happens will come at a time when search is already in flux—new entrants like OpenAI and Perplexity, and indeed Google itself, are starting to use AI to give people more definitive-seeming answers to their search queries, rather than presenting them with lists. (Disclosure: Fortunerecently struck a revenue-sharing deal with Perplexity.) I suspect that, years down the line, people will be furiously debating how much of an effect the Google antitrust ruling really had in the grand scheme of things, just as they’ve argued about the true impact of Europe forcing Microsoft to proactively give people a choice of browser on their Windows PCs back in 2010.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat is, unless Mehta takes the nuclear option and decides that Google must divest Chrome or even Android. This sort of effect is not up for much interpretation, though my gut feeling is that it’s unlikely.\n\nHowever, there is one thing we can say for sure: This precedent-setting ruling will add fuel to the other big antitrust lawsuits that are underway, involving Meta, Apple, Amazon—and again Google, which the Justice Department is suing over its ad-tech practices. In those contexts, it’s a big endorsement for the department’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, and his aggressive approach to tackling Big Tech. (Kanter was a Biden appointee, though this Google search case dates back to the Trump era.)\n\n“This landmark decision holds Google accountable. It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans,” Kanter said in a statement.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street sees ‘buying opportunity’ amid AI pullback",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence stocks, a hallmark of the recent bull market run, have lost steam over the past month.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) are all down more than 15% over the period amid a broader market sell-off that's seen the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) decline more than 10% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid more than 8%. Even as investors have begun to question recent earnings results from the group, some strategists don't think this is the end of the AI run.\n\n\"We keep our overweight to U.S. equities, driven by the AI mega force, and see the selloff presenting buying opportunities,\" BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a research note Monday night.\n\nRecession fears have driven the market lower as investors speculate over whether the Federal Reserve is keeping monetary policy too restrictive. BlackRock describes these concerns as \"overdone.\"\n\n\"We think growth will be supportive of risk assets and believe markets are pricing in too many Fed rate cuts,\" the team wrote.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel, who holds the most bullish year-end S&P 500 target on Wall Street at 6,000, isn't backing down either. In a note to clients on Monday, Emanuel noted that the recent spike in the CBOE Volatility Index(^VIX), provides the opportunity for \"patient buying.\" Quick spikes in volatility, as seen on Monday, usually end with stocks higher a year later, per Emanuel.\n\nHe likens the current moment to the large drawdowns seen in tech stocks during the \"1994-99 Boom bull market.\"\n\n\"The rationale for AI, in a world where the global workforce is aging rapidly and efficiency will be critical to drive productivity enhancements, is greater than ever,\" Emanuel wrote. \"We view the current 'AI Air Pocket' as an opportunity to gain exposure to a long term secular theme.\"\n\nStill, if investors have been staying out of the large tech names because valuations have risen to an uncomfortable level, whether the recent drawdown has done enough to create an attractive buying opportunity is up for debate.\n\nThe equity research team at Goldman Sachs points out that while the basket of large tech stocks, including — Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, Meta (META), Microsoft and Nvidia — is down 13% since July 10, earnings estimates have been moving higher. Since June 30, 2025 earnings estimates for all of those companies except Microsoft have risen.\n\nThis has brought a contraction of valuation multiples for the group of tech stocks, but they still trade slightly higher than the 10-year median average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The mega-cap tech stocks have dropped sharply, but their valuations continue to reflect AI optimism despite investor concerns about the likely timing,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Monday night.

        "content": "When investing in the stock market, you don’t need much money to get started. Consistently investing small amounts like $100 per month can be a smart strategy, especially if you focus on high-quality, blue-chip stocks with a history of weathering market storms and delivering compounding returns over the long term.\n\nWhile the current market sell-off may cause short-term losses, these proven businesses have the power to recover and reward patient investors who steadily build positions over time. By spreading out your investments and taking a long-term perspective, you can minimize risk and position your portfolio for growth.\n\nSo, without further ado, let’s dive into our list of the top seven stocks to buy if you can only invest $100 monthly. While investing is not guaranteed, these blue-chip names have the potential to be core holdings in your portfolio for years to come. You can buy one or more each month using fractional shares.\r\n\r\nHere are the stocks to buy with $100 per month:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) logo, stock trade and chart on smartphone. Business and finance market.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is probably one of the best stocks a beginner investor can buy in the long run. By owning Berkshire, you get exposure to a collection of great blue-chip companies with high-quality businesses while benefiting from the firm’s immense flexibility to reallocate capital as market conditions change.\n\nFor instance, Berkshire has been selling stocks for seven straight quarters, including trimming its massive Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake by nearly 50%. I believe it’s a prudent move by Warren Buffett to take some profits off the table ahead of a potential market correction. You simply don’t get this strategic agility with an index fund or exchange-traded fund.\n\nAnalyst Cathy Seifert notes that Buffett may be preparing for an economic downturn, and with $277 billion in cash, Berkshire is positioned to weather this storm and capitalize on potential opportunities.\n\nAflac (AFL) the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office building\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAflac (NYSE:AFL) provides supplemental insurance in the U.S. and Japan. The company delivered solid earnings results in the first half of 2024, with adjusted earnings per share up 11.5% year-over-year to $3.49 for the six months.\n\nAflac has been one of the most consistent and stable stocks over the past many years, and its performance has only improved. While it may be in the supplemental insurance business, Aflac’s financials are incredibly sticky and have consistently improved. For the long-term investor, I think it represents an attractive place to put your money to work.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts seem to agree, and management is pleased with profitable growth in both the U.S. and Japan. However, I would caution that potential near-term headwinds in the Japanese market could create some bumps for Aflac’s stock in the coming months and quarters.\n\nOverall, though, dollar-cost averaging into Aflac seems like a solid long-term strategy if you’re looking for a stable compounder to invest each month. The company’s 43-year record of consecutive dividend increases is also hard to ignore for income-oriented investors.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nWaste Management (NYSE:WM) provides environmental services for waste management. If you want a reliable company to invest in monthly, give WM a look. The company has been executing well lately, with revenue up 5.5% year-over-year in the second quarter to $5.4 billion. Adjusted operating EBITDA also grew an impressive 10.3%. I like what I’m seeing here.\n\nZacks Research analysts recently trimmed their Q3 EPS estimate slightly, but they still expect solid full-year earnings of $7.11 per share for 2024. The long-term future looks bright, too, with the Zacks consensus calling for fiscal 2025 EPS of $7.67.\n\nThere was an interesting insider transaction recently, with VP Michael J. Watson selling $859,000 worth of shares in early June. While insider selling isn’t the best sign, Watson still owns over $9 million in company stock, so he’s well-aligned with shareholders.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) the exterior of a T-Mobile (TMUS) branded store\n\nSource: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a leading wireless network operator in the United States. The company has been on an absolute tear lately, delivering impressive growth and profitability while its main rivals struggle.\n\nIn Q2 2024, T-Mobile beat earnings estimates with EPS of $2.49 versus the $2.27 expected, and revenue also topped forecasts. Analysts have been raising their price targets after the strong results, with all 17 analysts covering the stock rating it a “buy.” The stock is up about 6% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500’s 4% loss.\n\nT-Mobile’s 5G network leadership, “Un-carrier” customer-centric strategy, and smart capital allocation continue to drive industry-leading growth. In Q2, it reported the highest postpaid phone net additions in company history. Cash flow is also surging, with Q2 free cash flow up 54% year-over-year.\n\nWhile some may worry about T-Mobile’s debt load, I think the company’s strong and consistent execution can continue powering the stock higher.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust that owns over 15,000 commercial properties across the United States and Europe. The company has been facing some headwinds lately, with its stock price up just 1.3% year-to-date, likely due to broader concerns in the real estate sector.\n\nBut if you’re looking to invest a modest amount each month, what better stock to buy than one that pays you monthly dividends? Realty Income’s current dividend yield of nearly 5.3% is among the highest. And these dividends have been rising consistently. Stocks to Buy With $100: Realty Income dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe Motley Fool recently posted that Realty Income’s positives outweigh its negatives and could now be a good entry point for long-term investors. The company’s 32-year track record of annual dividend increases is also hard to ignore. Realty Income looks like one of the best-positioned REITs to deliver reliable income and bounce back as the economic picture improves. For patient investors, collecting that monthly dividend could pay off. Thus, I think it is one of the top stocks to buy with $100 per month.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation with many iconic brands. Despite facing some challenges in the recent quarter due to declining demand in North America, PepsiCo remains one of the most consistent companies in recent decades and has continued to grow well.\n\nIn Q2 2024, PepsiCo’s revenue narrowly missed estimates at $22.5 billion, but its core EPS of $2.28 beat expectations. The company saw slower demand in its Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods segments, leading it to revise its full-year organic revenue growth forecast to approximately 4%. However, PepsiCo’s international business performed well, with 5.5% organic revenue growth.\n\nAnalysts have mixed opinions on PepsiCo. While some note the near-term headwinds from cautious consumer spending, others believe PepsiCo’s strong brand portfolio and global presence position it well for the long run. PepsiCo’s business is resilient and should hold up well even if the U.S. economy is in recession.\n\nIf you walk down any snack aisle, it will be hard to ignore PepsiCo’s products. It makes sense why this company has so much staying power. PEP stock has declined a bit due to the broader downturn for retailers, but I think this is a solid long-term bet you can put your money into each month. PepsiCo is hard to lose with in the long run, and you can also sit on its 3% dividend yield as you wait for it to recover.\n\nHoneywell International (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nHoneywell International (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving various industries. The company has been delivering strong results lately, with Q2 2024 organic sales up 4% year-over-year and earnings per share of $2.49, beating guidance by 7 cents. I believe Honeywell is one of the most well-rounded companies, with significant contracts in the military and emerging technology sectors, providing stability and consistency. The stock also offers a solid 2.1% dividend yield.\n\nWhile some analysts have raised concerns about margin pressure from Honeywell’s mix shift towards more long-cycle businesses in the near term, the overall consensus remains bullish, with an average price target of $227, implying an 14% upside. Honeywell’s exposure to attractive long-term trends like automation and aviation makes me believe it’s a reliable bet for the long haul. It deserves a spot in your portfolio if you’re investing steadily over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AAPL Stock Alert: Buffett Dumps 55% of Apple Shares. Should You?",
        "content": "Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a vital constituent of many portfolios. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) also comes under this category. However, Buffett’s decision to dump 55.8% of Berkshire’s Apple stock in the first half of 2024 raises eyebrows. This move contrasts with Buffett’s previous praise for the tech giant. Apple stock remains a strong long-term buy despite the sell-off due to its solid fundamentals and prospects.\n\nIndeed, Apple’s AI advancements and product ecosystem continue to drive its growth. Despite regulatory challenges and slowing sales in China, Apple’s innovative edge keeps it competitive. The company’s Q3 fiscal 2024 showed solid financial performance, as revenue and EPS hit new records. Buffett’s sale might seem alarming but one should compare Buffett’s actions against Apple’s long-term value and market lead.\n\nIn short, Apple’s AI strategy and solid performance make it a buy despite recent sell-offs. Moreover, Apple has a track record of delivering solid value through dividends and share buybacks, further solidifying its investment appeal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple’s AI Strategy and Product Innovation\n\nApple’s AI strategy is core to its growth. The introduction of Apple Intelligence (a suite of AI-driven features) marks the company’s focus on product innovation. Apple Intelligence includes advancements like a more powerful Siri and new AI capabilities across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. These features boost the user experience and derive product upgrades. In this line, the upcoming iPhone 16 series is particularly in focus.\n\nMoreover, AI integration into Apple’s ecosystem is a considerable growth driver. The refreshed Siri, capable of summarizing emails, transcribing calls and generating custom content, adds immense value. This positions Apple as a leader in AI technology in consumer electronics. AI-powered features are expected to spur a solid upgrade cycle, with analysts predicting strong demand for the iPhone 16.\n\nFurther, Apple’s financials support its investment in AI. The company’s Q3 2024 highlighted a 5% year-over-year revenue increase to $85.8 billion, with EPS up 11% to $1.40. These figures underscore Apple’s ability to generate consistent growth and profitability amid market challenges. Services revenue, a growth area, reached an all-time high, contributing considerably to overall financial health. Apple’s focus on innovation extends beyond AI. The company has a diverse product lineup, including the new MacBook Air and iPad Pro, showcasing catchy technology and user-centric design. Hence, these products, powered by Apple silicon, offer unparalleled performance and security, further solidifying Apple’s market lead.\n\nStory continues\n\nAddressing Counterarguments and Buffett’s Investment Strategy\n\nBuffett’s considerable reduction in Apple holdings raises questions about the stock’s potency. His actions indicate diminishing confidence in Apple. However, it’s vital to comprehend Buffett’s broader investment philosophy to counter market dynamics. Buffett’s several factors, like portfolio rebalancing, might lead to Buffett’s sale of Apple shares.\n\nInterestingly, Buffett has historically praised Apple’s fundamentals. He labeled the company as an “even better business” than American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). His move to sell a high portion of Apple stock might be strategic. This is to take advantage of high valuations and prepare for potential tax changes. Buffett mentioned that selling some Apple shares could benefit Berkshire shareholders if capital gains taxes rise.\n\nMoreover, investment strategies vary. What makes sense for Berkshire Hathaway might only apply to some investors. Apple’s slowing growth in China and regulatory challenges are valid concerns. However, these issues are expected to affect Apple and many companies. Apple’s strategic initiatives, such as expanding its AI capabilities and enhancing product features, aim to minimize these adversities. The company’s diversified revenue streams, including solid performance in services and wearables, provide a buffer against regional sales declines.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIn short, Apple stock remains a compelling long-term buy. One should consider Apple’s continued innovation, particularly in AI, and its strong financial performance. Looking ahead, one should also monitor Apple’s AI advancements and product launches. The upcoming iPhone 16 series, with its boosted AI features, could drive considerable upgrades and boost sales. Expanding services like Apple TV+ and Apple Pay also increase the company’s revenue diversification and growth potential.\n\nIndeed, one should also scan Apple’s lead in emerging markets. The company’s efforts to expand its presence in regions like India and Southeast Asia may push its top and bottom-line growth. Apple’s current valuation and market conditions are vital for Apple, as it is considering new positions or adding to existing ones.\n\nWhile the stock may counter short-term volatility, its long-term valuation prospects remain strong. Finally, the company’s strong cash flow and balance sheet enable continued investment in advancements (like AI).\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Inflows into ETFs of $472 million were outweighed by outflows from individual stocks at -$1.4 billion.\n\nInstitutional investors, on the other hand, bought the dip with +$14 billion in net buying (+2.9 standard deviations above the 12-month average) during market hours and -$6.7 billion in Market on Close (MOC) trades.\n\nThere was also strong demand for S&P ETFs, JPMorgan said, indicated by a $430 million inflow into Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO), SPDR® S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY), and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV), which were +7.6, +1.2, and +2.6 standard deviations above their respective 12-month averages.\n\nIn contrast, retail investors were significant sellers of Nasdaq 100 ETFs.

        "title": "Rate Cuts Incoming? These 7 Stocks Could Skyrocket",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve is telegraphing a possible September rate cut that will supercharge the stock market. If inflation continues to fall, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that “a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table” when the committee next reconvenes in mid-September, leading to the formation of some good stocks for rate cuts.\n\nIf the Fed does cut rates it will prompt the first decrease in lending rates in four years. Lowered borrowing costs will prompt increases in economic activity at all levels. Businesses will have access to cheaper capital that will prompt borrowing to stimulate growth which in turn drives the economy higher in aggregate. Consumers will respond similarly to lower rates. That should stimulate spending across all sectors, sending shares higher.\n\nThat isn’t to say the effects will be felt equally across all sectors of the market. Certain shares tend to fare better in a rate-cut environment. Tech, financial, and consumer discretionary shares tend to perform better for a multitude of reasons. Let’s look at some of those shares which are set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a well-respected real estate income trust (REIT) stock that is truly worth buying. Generally speaking, REITs focused on commercial property and the residential sector do particularly well as rates fall: Rate cuts alleviate substantial pressure in those firms. Realty Income is a commercial REIT that rents commercial properties to industry-leading firms on a long-term basis.\n\nSo, it already enjoys strong performance due to its ability to contract with high-performing firms. Realty Income also operates those contracts under the net lease structure. That means most expenses associated with its properties fall on the lessee and not Realty Income.\n\nREITs like Realty Income have gone largely underappreciated for the past few years as high bond yields have made their dividend income less attractive. That has shifted more recently as bond yields correct. Realty Income should strengthen even more as September approaches and the positive effects of rate cuts become more apparent to potential O investors. None of that even considers the monthly dividend paid by Realty Income. Reinvestment periods are more frequent and that is but one more reason to consider O stock currently.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is sort of an obvious pick among stocks set to skyrocket on incoming rate cuts. Tech stocks are generally seen as strong investments as borrowing costs fall. They tend to rely heavily on financing to expand and cheaper lending makes those investments more attractive overall. Amazon, as one of the best tech stocks, benefits as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon currently has more than $135 billion in debt. That debt has an effective interest rate of 1.91% and results in a quarterly interest payment of $2.576 billion. Amazon, like everyone else, benefits from the ability to lower that payment as rates fall.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has more than $85 billion in cash on hand currently. It could find a way to pay off its debt if management decided it was a pertinent strategy. Earnings are expected to grow by approximately 30% on average over the next few years so Amazon’s debt is not a problem. Regardless, it will become more manageable as soon as rate cuts occur.\n\nAmazon will also benefit from a surge in discretionary spending that usually occurs when rates fall. Consumer confidence rises and retailers including Amazon benefit.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is going through a patch of trouble that isn’t necessarily reflected in its current stock price. Profit margins are as bad as they’ve been in 5 years and the company continues to cut prices which will only exacerbate its issues. Why then should investors consider TSLA shares?\n\nWell, for one, Tesla is well-positioned to benefit from upcoming rate cuts. As my colleague Larry Ramer noted, Tesla heavily subsidizes the loans used to purchase its vehicles. As rates fall those loans will perform better, improving the bottom line.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that vehicle purchases generally rise in a falling rate environment. Consumers, bolstered by lower lending rates, tend to go out and purchase vehicles more often.\n\nBeyond that, R&D investments also become cheaper. Tesla continues to develop its humanoid robot known as Optimus. Elon Musk is very optimistic about its potential effects on the company and suggests that it could make Tesla a $25 trillion dollar company in the future. However, it has not yet met expectations which is very typical of Tesla projects overall. Anyway, lower rates will cheapen lending used to further research and develop Optimus which is another reason to consider Tesla at the moment.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to be one of the biggest stories in the stock market today. Its recent decline from $130 to adjust above $100, has irked investors.\n\nPundits had worried that the shares would fall below $100 but at the time of writing, that doesn’t look to be the case. Instead, Nvidia shares jumped by nearly 13% in the 24 hours before this article was written. That sent prices above $117 reinstalling confidence in the AI infrastructure hardware narrative.\n\nNvidia is also a beneficiary of incoming rate cuts for the simple fact that AI spending should increase as rates fall. It’s logical to assume that AI hyperscalers will be upping their investment in Nvidia chips as a result of rate cuts.\n\nNvidia’s revenues are expected to double between this year and 2027. So, even though Nvidia has been volatile this year overall growth is nowhere near over. The growth and return on AI stocks is likely to come in stages. Those stages will not be even but Nvidia will continue to be the best AI hardware play nonetheless among stocks for rate cuts.\n\nJP Morgan (JPM) JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinancial stocks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) generally perform well during rate cuts. JPMorgan Chase is a massive lending center after all: It benefits from a rush of demand as lower rates prompt businesses to invest and drive lending higher.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is the largest U.S. bank and the 5th largest globally as measured by assets. It’s also highly aligned with the business sector and should see greater lending demand than rivals like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) which are more consumer-oriented.\n\nThe company isn’t necessarily a stronger performer overall. But recent consolidation has made it a bigger behemoth and that matters. Investors will be looking to the financial sector and banks in particular as rate cuts occur. JPM shares will be top of mind for the sheer scale of the firm. As a result, it should appreciate in price. Don’t be surprised if share prices continue to rise after an already strong first half in 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is poised to continue its strong performance following rate cuts. 2024 has not been easy for the iPhone seller and tech giant. Most of its 20% returns this year occurred following its AI announcements in June. It continues to deal with the effects of inflation and high rates of discretionary spending for high-priced items including the iPhone. Those effects have been felt globally, particularly in China where sales have slumped dramatically.\n\nDiscretionary spending increases as rates fall. That implies that Apple’s flagging iPhone sales will benefit dramatically if rates fall.\n\nInvestors continue to wonder when high AI capital expenditures will pay off for the tech giants. Apple. Those expenditures have served as a drag on prices of late. AMD’s strong earnings suggest that a clear answer in either direction will take time to emerge and that recent concerns about mega firms are overblown.\n\nApple should benefit significantly from the application of AI to iPhones and the concurrent drop in rates that should prompt increased discretionary spending and boost stocks for rate cuts like AAPL.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has historically performed well as rates come down. The stock performs well for a simple reason: people tend to take out home improvement loans at higher rates as interest rates fall.\n\nNow is arguably a good time to establish a position in Home Depot given that it trades below consensus target prices. Some investors would argue that Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) makes a better trade given its lower valuation. However, Home Depot has always traded at a richer valuation than Lowe’s. It is the dominant home improvement company and with that comes higher prices.\n\nFurthermore, Home Depot is enacting a $500 million cost-cutting initiative which should result in stronger earnings. In turn, that should help to justify HD stock’s richer valuation relative to its main competitor.\n\nIn short, there is a blend of macroeconomic and internal factors at play which should catalyze Home Depot stock to move higher in anticipation of incoming great cuts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- The Wall Street indices are set to rebound Tuesday after the previous session's slump, following on from Nikkei's bounce, while Alphabet's Google lost an antitrust case in the U.S.\n\n1. Futures rebound after sharp selloff\n\nU.S. stock futures rose Tuesday, rebounding after the previous session’s sharp losses on concerns that the U.S. economy was heading towards recession.\n\nBy 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 240 points, or 0.6%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 50 points, or 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 175 points, or 1%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices suffered a brutal start to the new week, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 1,000 points, or 2.6%, and the broad-based S&P 500 index falling 3%, their worst sessions since September 2022.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 3.4%, tumbling deeper into correction territory.\n\nResults from industrial bellwether Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are due later in the session, and will give more insight into the health of manufacturing and the consumer. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is also expected to report, and will be in particular focus as it is at the center of the market's artificial intelligence excitement.\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) surged 10% premarket on strong quarterly results and a guidance lift, while Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) rallied over 13% on better-than-expected revenue in the second quarter.\n\n2. Google loses US antitrust case\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google violated antitrust law, a U.S. Federal Judge ruled on Monday, as the tech giant lost its legal battle against the Department of Justice, the first big win for federal authorities taking on Big Tech's market dominance.\n\n“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Judge Amit Mehta in Washington ruled on Monday.\n\nThe judge concluded that Google has \"violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States general search services and general text advertising-through its exclusive distribution agreements.\"\n\nThe ruling, which can be appealed, marked a major win for the DoJ, who had argued that Google's agreements with companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), to make Google the default search engine on smartphones violated antitrust laws.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine potential fixes, possibly including a breakup of Google parent Alphabet, and also offers encouragement to the U.S. antitrust authorities prosecuting the powerful Big Tech companies.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Harris set to unveil running mate\n\nKamala Harris is set to unveil her vice presidential running mate later Tuesday, her first major decision as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate as she attempts to win the White House in November.\n\nHarris has narrowed her list of candidates to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Reuters reported, citing sources.\n\nHarris became the Democratic Party's standard bearer after President Joe Biden ended his re-election campaign last month, gathering sufficient delegates to be her party's nominee, and prompting the Democratic National Committee late on Monday to confirm she had officially secured the nomination.\n\nHarris is expected to appear with her running mate at an event in Philadelphia late Tuesday.\n\n4. Nikkei rebounds, but still in bear market\n\nMost Asian stock markets rebounded Tuesday, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index leading the way.\n\nThe Nikkei surged 10% Tuesday, helped by some bargain buying, as traders piled into heavily discounted stocks with strong fundamentals, and which are likely to benefit from lower interest rates in the coming months.\n\nThat said, the Nikkei still remained in bear market territory after tumbling just over 12% in the prior session, its worst day since the 1987 Black Monday crash.\n\nStill, a recovery in Japanese markets was still a “little time away,” with markets likely to trade flat in the near-term before gaining enough confidence for a recovery, Citi analysts said in a note.\n\nThe near-term outlook for Japanese markets remains dour, with Citi forecasting risk-off trades to “dominate.” The brokerage recommended defensive sectors in the near-term.\n\nThe brokerage said that a brief U.S. recession, guarantees of stimulus support for the global economy and a less hawkish tone from the BOJ will be needed to spark a recovery in local markets.\n\n5. Crude rebounds from lows\n\nCrude prices rose Tuesday, rebounding from eighth-month lows as traders took advantage of battered levels to restock and as MIddle East tensions remain.\n\nBy 04:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.4% to $73.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $76.44 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over an escalation in the Israel-Hamas war, especially after Iran vowed retaliation over the killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran, have provided an element of support for the oil markets.\n\nHowever, sentiment remains very fragile amid fears slowing economic growth will dent demand, especially as underwhelming U.S. labor market readings ramped up concerns over a potential recession in the country.\n\nThe weak U.S. labor readings were preceded by dismal readings from China, especially on the country’s manufacturing sector, added to concerns over slowing demand in the world’s biggest oil importer.\n\nMore readings from China are due later this week, with trade data for July in particular focus as it will provide insight into the country’s oil imports.\n\nSaudi energy giant Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) reported a 3.4% decline in its second-quarter net income earlier Tuesday on lower crude volumes.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures, Nikkei rebound, Google's case - what's moving markets\n\nAustralia central bank rules out near-term rate cut on inflation risks\n\nAustralia's RBA rules out rate cuts in near-term\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Unprecedented $132 Billion Warning to Wall Street Can't Be Ignored Any Longer",
        "content": "When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, the whole of Wall Street pays close attention. Delivering an aggregate return of more than 5,180,000% in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) since becoming CEO in 1965, and effectively doubling up the annualized total return of the broad-based S&P 500 spanning almost six decades, has garnered Buffett quite the following.\n\nIn particular, investors typically wait on the edge of their seat for clues as to what the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has been buying or selling. These \"clues\" can be divulged when:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway files its quarterly Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- a 13F is a snapshot of what Wall Street's top money managers have been buying and selling. The company lifts the proverbial hood on its quarterly operating results. Buffett releases his annual letter to shareholders. Buffett speaks candidly with investors during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThe release of Berkshire's second-quarter operating results on August 3 offered a big clue as to what the Oracle of Omaha and his trusted investment advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have been up to. More specifically, it revealed an unprecedented level of selling activity in the company's 44-stock investment portfolio.\n\nBuffett and his team have been net-sellers of equities since October 2022\n\nLet me preface this discussion by making one thing clear: Warren Buffett is a long-term optimist on the U.S. economy and stock market. On numerous occasions throughout his tenure as CEO, he's spoken about the strength of the U.S. economy and the value of patience.\n\nBut just because he's a long-term optimist, it doesn't mean he'll overpay for time-tested businesses.\n\nDuring the June quarter, Berkshire Hathaway's consolidated cash flow statements show only $1.615 billion in equity security purchases -- some of which is tied to the company's continued purchase of Occidental Petroleum stock.\n\nComparatively, Buffett and his top aides oversaw the sale of $77.151 billion of equity securities. The lion's share of this selling activity is tied to Berkshire's largest position, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The $84.2 billion fair value estimate for Berkshire's stake in Apple, as of June 30, implies that nearly half of the company's holdings in the tech stalwart were disposed of during the second quarter. This follows the sale of more than 116 million shares of Apple in the first three months of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltogether, $75.536 billion in net equities were sold in the second quarter, which is the most Berkshire Hathaway has ever sold in a single quarter.\n\nFurthermore, it marks the seventh consecutive quarter that Buffett and Co. have sold more securities than they've purchased:\n\nQ4 2022: $14.64 billion in net-equity sales Q1 2023: $10.41 billion Q2 2023: $7.981 billion Q3 2023: $5.253 billion Q4 2023: $0.525 billion Q1 2024: $17.281 billion Q2 2024: $75.536 billion\n\nIn aggregate, $131.63 billion in net-equity sales have been undertaken since Oct. 1, 2022. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett's $132 billion warning has become deafening\n\nTo be fair, Warren Buffett has a logical scapegoat to justify Berkshire's record-breaking selling activity. During his company's annual shareholder meeting in May, the Oracle of Omaha opined that corporate tax rates were likely headed higher in the future. Thus, locking in some profits at a historically lower corporate tax rate would, in hindsight, be viewed favorably by his company's shareholders.\n\nWhile it's possible the extraordinary selling activity we've witnessed in Apple, and more recently Bank of America, is tax-based, the more likely explanation is that Buffett's roughly $132 billion in net-equity sales is a silent, yet deafening, warning for Wall Street.\n\nAlthough Buffett would never bet against America -- i.e., you'll never seen him buying put options or short-selling stocks -- he's not been shy about holstering his cash when value is few and far between on Wall Street. In other words, the long-term mantra the Oracle of Omaha preaches doesn't always align with his actions over shorter timelines.\n\nIf there's a valuation model that demonstrates just how pricey stocks are right now, it's the S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is also commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or Cape ratio. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nUnlike the traditional P/E ratio, which divides a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share and is easily the most-popular valuation metric, the Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the prior 10 years. Examining a decade's worth of earnings history helps to smooth out one-off events that can adversely impact traditional valuation models.\n\nAs of the closing bell on August 2, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E stood at 34.48. This is down modestly from a peak of 37 in recent weeks, but still represents one of the highest readings we've observed during a bull market rally, when back-tested to 1871!\n\nIncluding the present, there have only been a half-dozen occasions in more than 150 years where the Shiller P/E ratio has topped 30 during a bull market. The previous five instances were all followed by plunges of 20% to 89% for Wall Street's major stock indexes.\n\nThough the Shiller P/E isn't a timing tool and won't help investors decipher when stock market corrections will begin, it does have a flawless track record of eventually forecasting major downside in the stock market.\n\nBuffett wants no part of the \"casino,\" but will pounce when the time is right\n\nThe unprecedented selling activity we've witnessed from Buffett and his team through the first-half of the year was, arguably, telegraphed in February by the Oracle of Omaha himself. In his annual letter to shareholders, he spoke candidly about the dangers of \"casino-like behavior\" on Wall Street:\n\nThough the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today's active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\n\nThis is another instance of Buffett warning investors of the dangers of irrational exuberance on Wall Street without (key word!) telling investors to sell their stock or avoid the market altogether.\n\nBut what Buffett does have working in his and his company's favor is the ability to respond to large-scale market opportunities when the pendulum swings in the other direction. Nabbing a sizable stake in Bank of America (via preferred stock, initially) in 2011 following the financial crisis is just one example of how Berkshire's investment team has used its treasure chest to take advantage of short-lived periods of fear on Wall Street.\n\nFollowing a quarter that featured historic levels of equity sales, Berkshire's cash pile, which includes cash equivalents and U.S. Treasuries, hit an all-time high of $277 billion. The options available to Buffett and his top aides are seemingly limitless.\n\nIf history has taught us anything, it's that Warren Buffett will deploy Berkshire Hathaway's cash hoard when wonderful businesses are trading at fair prices. Although it could be some time before we see this capital put to work, Buffett's long-term faith in the American economy and stock market remains unwavering.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Magnificent Megacap Stock Instead",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is considered one of the greatest investors in American history due to his track record with Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Specifically, Berkshire stock has compounded at roughly 19.8% annually since Buffett took control of the company in 1965, nearly doubling the performance of the S&P 500.\n\nIn recent years, one of the most widely discussed aspects of his business has been its sizable stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire began buying shares in 2016. Whether the original purchase was made by Buffett or his understudies is unknown, but Buffett likely controlled the position as it grew in size over the years, and he is likely responsible for trimming the position in recent quarters.\n\nQ4 2023: Apple accounted for 49% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. Q1 2024: Apple accounted for 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. Q2 2024: Apple accounted for 30% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\n\nIn May 2023, Buffett said, \"Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business.\" That statement is seemingly at odds with the recent selling spree. CNBC estimates that Berkshire's stake in Apple declined to 400 million shares in June 2024, a 55% reduction from 905 million shares in December 2023.\n\nHowever, Buffett's conviction in another megacap company has not wavered. He has repurchased shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock in each of the last three quarters, spending a collective $5 billion on buybacks. The message is clear: Buffett believes Berkshire is undervalued.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple has cultivated immense pricing power by pairing trendy hardware with proprietary software and services, creating a closed ecosystem that other manufacturers cannot replicate. Indeed, the average iPhone sells for three times more than the average Android smartphone. Apple has a strong presence in smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and smartwatches, and the company also operates the leading mobile app store and it has one of the fastest-growing advertising businesses in the U.S.\n\nApple reported lackluster financial results in the June quarter, despite beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 4.8% to $85.8 billion and GAAP net income rose 7.6% to $21.4 billion. There were a few highlights. The company continued to repurchase stock, so earnings per share increased 11%. Apple also reported 14% sales growth in services, which come with much higher margins than its hardware products.\n\nHowever, sales in China fell 6% and operating income slipped 10% during the quarter, as promotions failed to overcome waning demand for iPhones. Indeed, IDC estimates that quarterly iPhone shipments in China declined 3%, despite an acceleration in the broader market. As a result, Apple lost its spot among top five smartphone companies in the region, while local competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi gained share. That trend is problematic because China accounted for 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended September 2023).\n\nStory continues\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 10% annually through fiscal 2025. That makes its current valuation of 33.5 times earnings look outrageously expensive. I say that because it gives Apple a PEG ratio of 3.4, well above the three-year average of 2.5. That may explain why Buffett has aggressively sold Apple in recent quarters, and it also leaves room for continued selling in future quarters.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns subsidiaries in a diverse range of industries, including insurance, railroads, energy, utilities, manufacturing, and retail. The core insurance business generates investable cash with which Warren Buffett has earned great returns. As evidence, Berkshire's book value per share -- a good measure for changes in intrinsic value -- compounded at 12% annually over the last five years, nearly keeping pace with the 13.1% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nBerkshire has another important quality in its resilience. Its subsidiaries have not only been hand selected by Buffett, a consummate investor with a knack for identifying competitively advantaged businesses, but also the diverse nature of those subsidiaries means Berkshire is not overly reliant on a single sector or industry. That has helped Berkshire outperform the S&P 500 during difficult market environments, as shown in the chart below.\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Berkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (24%) October 2007 (57%) (54%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (27%) Average (41%) (34%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nBerkshire reported reasonably good financial results in the June quarter. Revenue rose 1.2% to $93.7 billion and operating earnings increased 16% to $11.6 billion. The shining star was the insurance segment, where operating earnings from underwriting and fixed-income investments climbed 56%. Meanwhile, earnings generally declined across other segments.\n\nAs a caveat, GAAP net income dropped 16% to $30.3 billion during the quarter. However, Buffett has cautioned investors to ignore that figure because it includes gains and losses (both realized and unrealized) on stocks. In the June quarter, Berkshire recorded $28 billion in unrealized losses versus $24 billion in unrealized gains in the same quarter last year. That discrepancy explains the decline in GAAP earnings.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Berkshire to grow operating earnings at 12% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 22 times operating earnings look a little expensive, though Buffett clearly believes the stock is undervalued. \"With our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" Buffett wrote in his most recent shareholder letter.\n\nInvestors looking to strengthen their portfolio with a defensive stock should consider buying a small position in Berkshire Hathaway today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaway Stock (NYSE:BRK.B): Don’t Panic Following Halving of Apple Stake",
        "content": "Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) may have shocked some over the weekend when it was disclosed that it had cut its massive Apple (AAPL) stake in half as it released its latest round of quarterly earnings results. With a massive cash mountain that’s since grown to be even more towering, there are many unanswered questions when it comes to Berkshire, Apple, and the road ahead. Despite the giant question marks, I remain bullish on Berkshire Hathaway stock.\n\nAs you’d expect, the news sent shares of Berkshire and Apple nosediving on Monday (down 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively), a move exacerbated by Monday’s blow-up in the Japanese stock market. Despite the volatility spike, investors likely have nothing to panic over as Berkshire raises more cash that it’ll likely deploy once it finally sees better opportunities.\n\nBerkshire Raises Even More Cash after Historic Apple Share Sale\n\nBerkshire’s swelling cash pile (currently at a record $277 billion) and continued prudence make shares an even better defensive bet, in my humble opinion. To some, Berkshire’s record pile of cash is a “problem.” Sure, not being able to find opportunities to score a solid return relative to the risk is a problem.\n\nHowever, I’m sure you’d agree that it’s far less of a problem than being caught fully invested in the face of a painful stock market correction or crash without enough dry powder to take advantage of the bargains to be had on the way down.\n\nIn any case, Berkshire already had ample financial firepower before it sold off its latest chunk of AAPL shares. Further, some investors may be inclined to wonder if the magnitude of the recent Apple share sale is a red flag that the broader stock market is looking at a serious drawdown going into year’s end. Though it’s impossible to tell what Buffett is thinking in real-time, I think many investors are overreacting (maybe even panicking) in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe latest slate of tech earnings has been worrisome, as has negative momentum in the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) and the latest wave of fear rippling from Japan. And while the latest round of AAPL stock selling may be far more sizeable than many may have expected, the Oracle of Omaha already had a chance to address the Apple questions during Berkshire’s 2024 shareholder meeting.\n\nWhat to Make of the Apple Stock Sale\n\nWarren Buffett (and the late Charlie Munger) have had nothing but good things to say about the iPhone maker. Heck, at the latest Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett went as far as to say that Apple “is an even better business” than some of the other “wonderful” holdings in the Berkshire stock portfolio, as Apple CEO Tim Cook watched the meeting from special seats close to the front.\n\nThough the latest round of selling is a heck of a lot larger than the first sale made earlier this year (back then, Berkshire trimmed just 13% of its Apple stake), investors probably shouldn’t treat the paring as a sign that Apple is no longer a wonderful business. They shouldn’t assume that its Apple Intelligence product will fail to hit the mark or that the market is dancing on a knife’s edge. In fact, Buffett mentioned tax considerations as a reason for taking profits on a portion of Berkshire’s Apple stake.\n\nSome may be inclined to think it’s more than just taxes, given how massive the latest round of selling has been. However, I’d argue that the taxation reasoning still makes sense.\n\nWith recent chatter from the Biden administration pointing to the potential for capital gains taxes to go up in the U.S. (to a proposed 44.6% rate, which is even higher than Canada’s recent hike to 33%) for the wealthy, taking profits well ahead of time seems smart. Should Kamala Harris win the U.S. presidential election, the window to book gains at the old rate may close, perhaps sooner than expected.\n\nBerkshire Can Have Its Cake and Eat It, Too\n\nIn any case, there’s nothing stopping Berkshire from having their cake and eating it, too, by selling Apple here and buying back at a later date. By selling before any capital gains tax hike has a remote chance of happening, Buffett won’t have to risk taking as large a hit to the chin by selling later.\n\nFurther, nothing is stopping Berkshire from buying back into Apple at a later date, perhaps after the stock trades at more reasonable valuations. After the Apple Intelligence-driven rally, AAPL stock traded at close to 34 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the highest the multiple had been in recent memory. Indeed, Apple had become historically expensive, as the AI hype drove shares above $230 per share.\n\nEven with the latest round of selling, Apple remains the largest holding in the Berkshire stock portfolio, comprising around 28.4% of it at the time of writing. That’s still a massive stake that allows Berkshire to continue riding the firm higher as it moves into the age of generative AI.\n\nArguably, having one stock comprise nearly 30% of the portfolio is still excessive, given that Berkshire shareholders have expressed their concerns to Buffett at previous shareholder meetings over the company’s heavy concentration in Apple.\n\nIs Berkshire Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, BRK.B stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of three analyst ratings, there are two Buys and one Hold recommendation. The average BRK.B stock price target is $462.33, implying upside potential of 11.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $450.00 per share to a high of $472.00 per share.\n\nSee more BRK.B analyst ratings\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nBerkshire Hathaway may have alarmed some with the magnitude of its latest Apple stake paring. Despite the size of the sales, I view Buffett’s previous taxation explanation as still sound.\n\nAdditionally, with AAPL stock still trading at the high end of its range, I’d argue it’s only prudent to play with the house’s money at this juncture. Finally, such a big sale also reduces Berkshire’s single-stock risk, something that had been brought up by Berkshire shareholders in the past.\n\nSo, if you’re not overinvested in Apple, have no shareholders to appease, and won’t be affected by changes to tax policy, I’d argue it makes very little sense to follow Buffett and Berkshire by dumping AAPL stock, especially now that a chunk of the Warren Buffett premium was wiped off AAPL stock during Monday’s session. If you really want to follow Buffett’s style, buying Berkshire stock on the dip seems like a far better idea.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Apple, the biggest loser in the Google search ruling could be Mozilla and its Firefox web browser",
        "content": "“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nWith those words from United States District judge Amit Mehta on Monday, Google suffered a historic antitrust case loss at the hands of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mehta, the judge presiding over the trial, ruled that the tech giant has illegally maintained a monopoly through the billions of dollars in annual payments it makes to partners to secure the default search engine position on popular web browsers and mobile phones. With those dominant positions locked in, the argument goes, other competitors in the search and search advertising businesses have no chance of competing effectively.\n\nThe ruling immediately prompted speculation about the impact to Apple, which receives as much as $20 billion from Google every year in exchange for putting the search engine front-and-center on its iPhones via the Apple Safari web browser.\n\nBut while Apple would certainly take a big hit if the ruling is upheld, Apple is a large, diversified company with many sources of revenue. That's not the case for another partner of Google's located in the fallout zone of Monday's ruling: Mozilla, the non-profit tech org that makes the Firefox web browser.\n\nWhen users of Firefox type a search term into the browser, the query is automatically routed to Google's search engine. The arrangement is vital for Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation's 2021-2022 financial statement, which is the most recent published, $510 million out of its $593 million in revenue came courtesy of Google's search payments.\n\nIf that number $510 million were to go away entirely, Mozilla will have a serious problem on its hands.\n\nMozilla is putting on a brave face for now, and not directly addressing the existential threat that the ruling appears to pose.\n\n\"Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune on Monday. \"We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps...Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.\"\n\nFor Mozilla, which first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a community-driven project to challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the web browser market via Internet Explorer, Monday's ruling is the latest setback in a quest to find relevance in a market dominated by Big Tech companies. Mozilla laid off about 60 staffers earlier this year and saw its CEO step down.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can be sure that critics of the judge's ruling will highlight the potentially devastating impact on Mozilla to make the case that the antitrust ruling will have unintended consequences on smaller tech industry players. Others might argue that Mozilla hasn't done enough with those spoils to differentiate its Firefox browser, or that it could cut a deal with another search engine like Bing if its Google deal goes away completely.\n\nEither way, Google will appeal the suit so a long battle may ensue. And there's another big domino to fall: the judge will rule on the remedy or remedies — essentially, the business-model penalties — that Google will face.\n\nEvercore ISI research analyst Mark Mahoney tacked them off in a research note on Monday evening:\n\n\"The exact remedy is key, and so far, it’s hard to pick a winning horse among a range of outcomes,\" he wrote. \" i) forbidding payment from Google altogether, ii) a cap on the amount of distribution agreement fees, iii) pushing Apple to implement a “choice screen”, or iv) something else? In any case, we expect at least another 6 months to a year before we would know the exact remedies (or longer if the judge decides to stay the remedies phase pending GOOG’s appeal).\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Monday, recovering mildly after Wall Street logged a series of bruising losses amid growing concerns over an economic slowdown.\n\nAn element of bargain buying also aided stocks, particularly those in the technology sector, after a sharp drop in valuations over the past few weeks.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.9% to 5,263.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 1.2% to 18,224.25 points by 19:07 ET (23:07 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.5% to 39,053.0 points.\n\nRecession fears spark deep losses, S&P and Nasdaq at 3-mth lows\n\nConcerns over a drastic slowdown in economic growth, following a string of underwhelming purchasing managers index and labor market readings, saw Wall Street tumble from near record highs over the past two weeks.\n\nLosses came to a head on Monday, with the S&P 500 sliding 3% to 5,186.33 points, while the NASDAQ Composite tumbled 3.4% to 16,208.38 points, with both indexes at three-month lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.6%% to a two-month low of 38,703.27 points.\n\nWeak economic data fueled fears that the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates high for too long, and that any cuts by the central bank now would be insufficient in helping the economy gain a soft landing.\n\nStill, markets did increase their expectations for a 50 basis point cut in September, and were pricing in at least 100 bps in rate cuts this year, CME Fedwatch showed.\n\nTech steadies from bruising losses\n\nLosses on Wall Street were driven chiefly by extended selling in technology stocks, amid a mix of factors.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was among the worst performers on Monday on news that Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRKa) had halved its stake in the iPhone maker. The stock rose slightly in aftermarket trade.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 2.4% after tumbling over 6% on a report that the firm’s latest artificial intelligence chip will be delayed due to a design flaw.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose slightly after tumbling 4.5%, as a court ruled the firm had violated antitrust law with its search engine.\n\nQ2 earnings set to continue\n\nSome major earnings are still due in the coming days. Industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) and ride sharing giant Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) are set to report on Tuesday.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) is also due on Tuesday, and is set to offer more cues on demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nMedia giants Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) are due on Wednesday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nUS stock futures rise after recession fears spark bruising losses\n\nCiti hires Singapore executive from DBS to lead wealth in Asia South\n\nTwo of Jeffrey Epstein's close advisers can face victims' claims\n\nView comments",

Has It Worked? What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\n\nApple shares slipped almost 5% on Monday after a judge ruled that Google’s payments to device makers — made in return for its search engine getting preferential placement — were illegal. The decision handed a win to the Justice Department in its first major antitrust case against Big Tech in more than two decades.\n\nFor Apple, the move jeopardizes a revenue stream that has helped bolster sales in recent years. But the iPhone maker has already been moving away from its dependence on traditional internet searches. With Apple revamping its Siri digital assistant to handle queries more deftly — and integrating AI chatbots into its software — it’s betting that AI technology will eventually take over.\n\nThat underlines the government’s struggle with the technology industry: It moves so quickly that by the time a serious reckoning comes, the industry is already restructuring itself around the next innovation.\n\nApple is weaving OpenAI’s ChatGPT capabilities into its software and expects to do the same with Google’s Gemini chatbot. Over time, the company could steer consumers toward AI and Siri instead of the web browser.\n\nThat would give Apple the opportunity to reach new, nonexclusive agreements with AI providers — including Google — that don’t run afoul of the US government. Still, it will likely take many years for Apple to make serious money from AI.\n\nFor Google, the decision is a bit of a mixed blessing, given the hefty amounts that it’s paid Apple to make its search engine the default option.\n\n“In the short term, it actually could save them a lot of money,” said Ari Paparo, an advertising entrepreneur who used to work at Google.\n\nMonday’s decision didn’t mandate the ways Google could satisfy the government, but Judge Amit Mehta scheduled a hearing next month to discuss timing of a separate trial on that topic. It’s unlikely that the court could force Apple to drop Google as a search partner altogether as one of the remedies, but it could potentially change the agreement’s terms — and level the playing field.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne theoretical scenario would be Apple presenting different search engine options to consumers when they turn on their new device for the first time. Such a system could work similarly to a menu on Apple devices in the European Union that presents a choice of web browsers.\n\nWith that approach, Google would still remain an option, but customers could also pick alternatives such as Microsoft Bing or DuckDuckGo. Currently, users need to delve into the iPhone settings app to change their default search engine.\n\nIn his decision, Mehta said that the lucrative Google agreement has disincentivized Apple from launching its search engine “when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so.”\n\nJohn Giannandrea, an ex-Google executive who oversees AI at Apple, has a search team working for him. But they’ve been more focused on search capabilities within Apple’s software, rather than the ability to do Google-style web queries.\n\nEven so, Apple’s interface is set to change in the coming months. The company will be rolling out Apple Intelligence, its new suite of artificial intelligence features, which could eventually transform the way people use their iPhones and other devices.\n\nThe changes include a new “Type to Siri” approach that makes it easier to use the virtual assistant without having to speak to it. That will allow users to send queries to AI engines from anywhere in the iPhone, iPad or Mac operating systems.\n\n--With assistance from Julia Love.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Retailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Big Tech Traders Brace for More Swings as Selloff Turns Violent",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- For months investors have faced a dilemma — pay through the nose for technology giants trading at eye-watering multiples, or wait for a cheaper entry point and risk missing out on the year’s biggest bull run.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice New York City’s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing The 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk Paris Spent €1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked? Africa’s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\n\nThose that chose to sit on the sidelines got a big opportunity to pounce Monday amid a rout that saw the Nasdaq 100 Index fall as much as 5.5%, extending a three-day slump into the double digits. And while many loaded up on shares of Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. at steep discounts to where they traded just days earlier, they were undoubtedly the minority. Most were content to bide their time, unconvinced that the selloff is over.\n\n“I’m waiting for a better opportunity to buy,” said Dan Cook, chief strategy officer with Apex Trader Funding. “I want to see an indication that the pressure has relieved a bit.”\n\nIt was a sentiment echoed by numerous investors amid growing fears of a US recession and concerns over heavy spending on artificial intelligence. While most said they were optimistic over the long-run, few said they were diving head long into the selloff.\n\n“Until we get the next positive driver, the path of least resistance could be down,” Cook added.\n\nWhere that driver will come from, however, remains unclear. Six of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies that have fueled much of this year’s gains have already reported earnings, leaving traders waiting several weeks before AI-darling Nvidia reports on Aug. 28. What’s more, in the wake of last week’s Federal Reserve meeting in which policymakers stood pat, the next gathering won’t be until September.\n\nResults so far have painted a mixed picture of the sector. Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Tesla Inc. all sank in the wake of their reports, which underlined concerns over issues including their growth prospects and spending plans. However, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple both rose following their results, while overall the group demonstrated positive trends for earnings stability and demand even as profit growth is set to slow in the second half of the year.\n\nSo far this season, 80% of companies in the S&P 500 tech index have topped earnings expectations, though fewer than 60% have for revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Last quarter, 90% beat on earnings and 56% did on revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 finished Monday’s session down 3%, well off the 5.5% decline at the start of trading, but still its second-worst day since 2022 (the other coming last month).\n\nWhile dip buying helped soften the blow, plenty of damage was done. Even after paring a drop that at one point sent Nvidia down 15%, the stock closed down 6.4%, erasing $168 billion in market value amid a report that its upcoming Blackwell chip will be delayed. Its shares have now fallen 26% from their June peak.\n\nApple tumbled as much as 11% on Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. cut its stake in the iPhone maker by nearly half. The stock closed down 4.8%.\n\nWhile the selloff has brought valuations down across the board, they’re far from bargain levels. The Nasdaq 100 is priced at 24 times profits projected over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that’s down from 28 times a month ago, it’s still above the benchmark’s 10-year average at nearly 22. Nvidia is priced at 31 times estimated earnings, while Apple and Microsoft Corp. are trading around 29 times.\n\n“Valuations aren’t screamingly cheap, but they are defensible,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “A lot of big tech are showing really strong growth, margin expansion, above-average earnings growth. They still deserve pretty healthy multiples, especially if we enter a more normalized rate backdrop.”\n\nThis earnings season has shown that while Big-Tech earnings remain strong, investors are growing more skeptical about heavy spending on AI computing infrastructure and questioning when those investments will begin paying off.\n\nDespite Monday’s carnage, there were some bright spots. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rallied to close up 1.8% amid bets that it’s poised to benefit from a potential Nvidia setback. Chip equipment makers including ASML Holding NV and Lam Research Corp. also rose.\n\n“The market could be still very volatile, but you know, those six or seven or eight things that make up this perfect storm, maybe a couple of them go away and investors get back on the playing field,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management.\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too Made-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown Retailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America Forty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google's antitrust loss could put billions at risk for Apple",
        "content": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) suffered a staggering shot to its search and advertising business on Monday, as District of Columbia's Judge Amit Mehta ruled in favor of the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit against the tech giant.\n\nIt may also cost Apple (AAPL), big time, too.\n\nHere's how: The ruling could force Google to make dramatic changes to its largest business, but it could also force Google to cancel a long-term revenue sharing agreement with Apple that requires the iPhone maker to use Google as the default search engine across its various devices.\n\nThe deal, called an Internet Services Agreement, has been in place since 2002, and has been adjusted over the years as new technologies, such as the iPhone, have been introduced. The gist of the deal is that Apple uses Google as its default search engine for its Safari browser, Spotlight Search, and Siri.\n\nIn return, Google pays Apple 36% of the search revenue generated on Apple devices using Google’s services. While Apple doesn’t reveal exactly how much it makes from the deal, court documents pegged the number at an estimated $20 billion in 2022, double what Google paid in 2020.\n\nApple couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe revenue from Google and Apple’s agreement is likely realized under Apple’s Services business segment, which is where it lists third-party advertising licensing agreements. In 2022, Apple saw $78.1 billion in Services revenue. If the $20 billion estimate is accurate, that means the deal accounted for roughly 25% of Apple’s Services revenue for the year.\n\nApple’s Services business is one of its fastest growing segments, and seen as a bulwark against the company’s slowing iPhone sales. The company has expanded the segment significantly over the years, adding its Apple Music+ and Apple TV+ platforms to the business. But the Google deal still makes up a massive chunk of the Services segment’s revenue.\n\nFrom a company-wide perspective, Apple generated $394.3 billion in revenue in 2022, meaning the Google agreement accounted for 5% of the company’s annual revenue for the year.\n\nLosing the ISA wouldn’t just hurt Apple, though. According to court documents, Google performed internal modeling in 2020 that found it would lose 60% to 80% of search volume on Apple’s iOS devices if its search engine was replaced as the default option\n\nLosing that search volume would cut into Google’s bottom line to the tune of $28 billion to $32 billion. With Google bringing in $182.5 billion in revenue in 2020, that would slice $15% to 17% off of the company’s bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle is sure to appeal the DOJ’s win, but if Mehta’s ruling stands Apple and Google could be in for some serious financial pain.

        "title": "‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks shed over $600 billion during selloff—Nvidia hit hardest",
        "content": "Big Tech stocks are having another no good, very bad day. After sending the market to record highs in the first half of 2024, megacap tech names have been among the biggest losers in a global selloff that began in earnest last week and continued Monday.\n\nThe “Magnificent Seven”—a movie-inspired moniker that refers to Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—became Wall Street’s hot catchphrase after the group accounted for half of the S&P 500’s total gains last year, according to a report from Morgan Stanley. Shares for all those companies were down at least 3% or more at close Monday, however, with the group losing more then $600 billion in collective market cap.\n\nEven before weaker-than-expected data on the U.S. economy last week reignited recession fears on Wall Street, Big Tech stocks were cooling down. Investors—eyeing a potential Fed rate cut, which has yet to materialize—shifted some of their tech winnings to more value-oriented sectors in what the Wall Street Journalcalled “a stock-market rotation of historic proportions.”\n\nGeopolitical tensions, meanwhile, have recently weighed heavily on chip stocks, including AI darling Nvidia. The chipmaker’s shares dropped 7% Monday, worst among the Magnificent Seven, but have still more than doubled year to date.\n\nThe tech behemoths had to blow out estimates for Q2 earnings calls, Baird’s Ted Mortonson previously told Fortune, to have any hope of quelling the selloff. That didn’t happen, with Amazonin particular missing on revenue and issuing a weak sales outlook last week.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have heard a lot about the Magnificent Seven’s heavy investment in AI, but much less about how it will impact these companies’ top lines in the near term. Regulatory pressure has been ramping up, too, including a ruling from a federal judge on Monday that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over search on Android and Apple iPhone devices.\n\nThe biggest factor driving Big Tech’s losses on Monday, though, was a meltdown on Japan’s Nikkei 225 index, which carried over to U.S. markets at the opening bell. The markets made a partial recovery midday, but information technology overall ended 3.78% down at close, per Bloomberg, the worst of any sector.\n\nWarren Buffett sells half his stake in Apple\n\nApple’s losses were in the spotlight after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed Saturday that it sold almost half its position in America’s largest company during the second quarter.\n\nLike many analysts, Infrastructure Capital Advisors CEO Jay Hatfield emphasized that Buffett’s move was not cause for panic over Apple’s viability. Hatfield noted his firm, however, thought Apple was overvalued at its recent high above the $237 mark. The iPhone maker’s shares dropped almost 5% Monday to take the stock below the $210 mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat value problem was enough for the Oracle of Omaha to dump Apple’s stock—a move long anticipated by Berkshire analysts. It’s not, Hatfield said, an indictment of the U.S. economy.\n\n“The notion that we’re going into recession because he sold Apple is patently ridiculous,” Hatfield said.\n\nAnd even if an economic downturn does materialize, many analysts say Apple—and the rest of the Magnificent Seven—enjoy incredible market dominance and massive free cash flows that can make them relative safety nets for investors. Monday’s selloff doesn’t change that.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Contrarian Stock Picks to Buy Against the Market Consensus",
        "content": "Heightened volatility on Wall Street means contrarian stock picks can be a game-changer for savvy investors. A contrarian investing strategy involves buying overlooked assets with the expectation that they will eventually increase in value. This article highlights three picks that may defy current trends and offer significant upside potential. While many follow the herd, those willing to explore less-traveled paths often discover hidden opportunities.\n\nWarren Buffett is widely recognized as one of the most successful investors of all time. His investment philosophy, which often goes against prevailing market trends, epitomizes contrarian investing. His conglomerate holding companyBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has recently sold about half of its holdings in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, among others. In other words, he has gone against investors who have been cheering mega-cap tech shares despite high valuation levels.\n\nYet, contrarian investing is not for the faint-hearted; it demands a sharp eye for undervalued assets and the ability to ride out market fluctuations. However, for those who master this approach, the rewards can be substantial. With strong fundamentals offered by these shares, investors can position themselves for potentially impressive returns. With that in mind, here are three intriguing contrarian stock picks for patient and discerning investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaxter International (BAX) The logo for Baxter International Inc (BAX) is displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe begin exploring top contrarian stock picks with  Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), a global heavyweight in the medical technology (medtech) sector. The company has a diverse portfolio of healthcare products in critical care, kidney care and surgical settings.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Baxter reported a 2% year-over-year (YOY) revenue increase to $3.6 billion, slightly surpassing estimates. Adjusted EPS was 65 cents, reflecting a 10% YOY growth. However, Baxter’s focus on essential, low-priced medical supplies has limited its pricing flexibility, affecting profit margins.\n\nTo enhance profitability, the company plans to divest low-margin businesses, including its Kidney Care segment, valued at over $4 billion. Recent FDA approvals for innovative products like the Novum IQ infusion pump and Dose IQ Safety Software are expected to drive future growth. Despite positive indicators and management raising EPS guidance for the year, concerns about profitability and strategic restructuring have led to a 9% decline in BAX shares year-to-date.\n\nNevertheless, the stock offers a 3.3% dividend yield and trades at attractive valuations of 11.9 times forward earnings and 1.2 times sales. Analysts project a 22% upside potential with a 12-month median price target of $43.00, positioning Baxter as a strong contrarian investment opportunity in the recovering medical technology market. Baxter will report its second quarter 2024 earnings on August 6.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext on our list of contrarian stock picks is Nike (NYSE:NKE), a powerhouse in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Despite its strong global brand and innovative products, Nike faced challenges in its recent fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings report.\n\nThe company posted $12.6 billion in revenue, a 2% YOY decline that missed expectations. Management cited difficulties in the Chinese market, a slowdown in lifestyle sales and inconsistent consumer trends as contributing factors. On a positive note, adjusted EPS came in at 99 cents, reflecting a remarkable 50% increase from the previous year. Despite these headwinds, Nike has demonstrated resilience, reporting an 11% YOY decline in inventories and expanding its gross margin by 110 basis points to 45%.\n\nWhile management anticipates a mid-single-digit revenue decline for fiscal 2025, analysts believe actual sales could exceed this guidance due to robust consumer confidence. Additionally, Nike is reinvesting nearly $1 billion in consumer-facing initiatives, including marketing efforts for the Paris Olympics.\n\nAs a result, NKE stock has plunged 32% since January. Currently, it offers a 2% dividend yield. Shares now offer better value relative to historical averages, trading at 23.9 times forward earnings and 2.2 times sales. Meanwhile, analysts have set a 12-month median price forecast of $91.00 for NKE stock, projecting a potential 23% upside.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stands out as a compelling contrarian stock pick in the oil and gas industry. Despite declining prices, continuing geopolitical tensions and a shift toward renewable energy, Occidental’s diversified assets, particularly in the Permian Basin and offshore Gulf of Mexico, position it for potential outperformance.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Occidental reported a 17% YOY revenue decline to $6 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS was 63 cents compared to $1.09 in the prior-year quarter. However, the company is strategically enhancing free cash flow and shareholder returns. Recently, it completed the CrownRock acquisition. The move is expected to improve operational efficiency and bolster further growth. Additionally, Occidental announced the sale of certain Delaware Basin assets for $818 million, with proceeds aimed at debt reduction. The company also focuses on transitioning to alternative energy and carbon management through direct air capture (DAC) investments and other innovative technologies.\n\nDespite a 3% YTD decline, OXY stock offers a 1.5% dividend yield. The shares are changing hands at attractive valuations of 16.6 times forward earnings and two times sales. Wall Street analysts project a 27% upside potential, with a 12-month median price target of $73.00, making Occidental a compelling contrarian investment in the energy sector. Occidental will report its second quarter 2024 earnings on August 7.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Best 6G Stocks to Buy in August 2024",
        "content": "6G is the sixth generation of cellular technology. The tech will be a massive leap forward from 5G, its predecessor, and will have ultra-high speeds (up to 500 times faster than 5G).\n\nBut it won’t just be about speed. 6G technology will have near-instantaneous response times and the ability to support billions of connected devices concurrently.\n\nDue to these benefits, 6G, which is expected to be here by 2030, will dramatically change how we do things and our daily lives. Whether it’s meetings, social media, transportation and even agriculture, 6G will create a more efficient way of doing things.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe 6G market value is expected to reach around $40.5 billion in the next eight years. The industry was worth about $5.9 billion last year and is expected to grow to $40.5 billion by 2032. In other words, there’s a ton of promise for this industry.\n\nHere are the best 6G stocks to buy this August.\n\nInterDigital (IDCC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInterDigital (NASDAQ:IDCC) is a wireless technology company that has been developing digital cellular and wireless products and networks for decades. Currently, the company is laying the groundwork for migration from 5G to 6G by investing heavily in research.\n\nInterDigital is one of the best 6G stocks to buy right now by virtue of its impressive price trajectory over the last two years. At a time like this in 2022, shares exchanged hands at around $60 apiece. Right now, at $136, that’s a surge of nearly 130%. This year alone, the share price has popped 25%.\n\nThe latest bump in price is on the back of InterDigital’s second-quarter results. Not only did it raise its full-year guidance for 2024, it beat estimates and registered an increase in revenue and net and non-GAAP income compared to last year’s quarter.\n\nSK Telecom (SKM) The logo for SK Telecoms displayed on an office building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSK Telecom (NYSE:SKM) provides wireless telecommunications and internet services for mobile phones, wireless data, and information communication solutions. The company is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, and is the largest mobile operator in the East Asian country, with control of over 50% of the local market share.\n\nIn Feb, SK Telecom announced a joint deal with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to create new technology to speed up the arrival of 6G networks, expanding its footprint in the race to 6G.\n\nInvestors will know the company’s financial standing when it releases its second-quarter results on Aug 6. But based on its earnings for last quarter and analyst ratings, SK Telecom is among the best 6G stocks to buy this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetween January and March, the company’s consolidated revenue and operating income moved up 2.3% and 0.8%, respectively, compared to the same period a year prior. Even more impressive was its net income performance, which gained 19.6%. Sales from its AI segment increased 10%.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year, Bloomberg reported Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was recruiting engineers to work on 6G technology. One job listing from the Silicon Valley-headquartered firm was for a cellular platform architect who’d evaluate 6G and create prototypes. The iconic tech company is quietly working on 6G, which is exciting for Apple product users and the future of the technology.\n\nInvestors looking to bet on 6G cannot go wrong with Apple. For starters, it’s one of just six companies worldwide to cross the trillion-dollar market cap. It was also the first company to achieve a $3 trillion valuation worldwide.\n\nIn addition, Apple shares have risen 17% year-to-date. It booked $85.8 billion in revenue last quarter — 5% more than the previous year. Earnings per share clocked in at $1.40 — 11% higher than last year. This signals Apple’s solid financial health. It’s an ideal go-to for investors looking for only the best 6G stocks in the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Stocks With Room to Rally Even Higher",
        "content": "Last week’s market plunge could be a great opportunity to put new money to work. It may be difficult to tell what stocks will be in for next. However, if a recent downturn in a name tempts you, don’t let all the fear, panic, shock and horror expressed by pundits on television scare you from buying undervalued stocks.\n\nSome stocks are bubblier than others. But you don’t need to pull the trigger on the worst-falling knives in the market, as they continue falling far faster than the rest of the stock market.\n\nWe will examine a few seemingly undervalued stocks that may have been unfairly dragged down over these past few weeks, primarily due to market-wide jitters. With recession worries picking up after the latest unemployment numbers, it’s an uneasy time to be an investor. However, worrisome times tend to offer some of the best deals. These are the top undervalued stocks to consider right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of few Magnificent Seven companies that didn’t induce anxiety when it reported quarterly results this summer. With AAPL stock finishing Friday’s freaky session up 0.7% (it was actually up way earlier in the day), it seems like Apple is more of a safe haven trade, even as the rest of tech wobbles.\n\nUndoubtedly, Apple Intelligence is a compelling catalyst. And if personalized AI is the real deal and not just a trendy gimmick to convince those with aged iPhones to upgrade, I think Apple could be one of the better performers of the Magnificent Seven moving over the next 18 months.\n\nIndeed, the former AI underdog has a real opportunity to lead the pack higher as we head into the next inning of AI: personalization and processing on the edge (or on local devices). In the meantime, Apple should continue demonstrating its relative resilience amid the July-August sell-off.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) makes productivity software for software developers, project managers, quality assurance analysts, team members and other project participants. Given the switching costs of moving to a rival, the Atlassian ecosystem has a pretty sizeable economic moat surrounding it.\n\nMany software professionals are already well-versed in Atlassian’s tools and technologies. So, unless there’s something markedly superior out there (there isn’t, in my opinion), a transition isn’t worth it, especially as Atlassian continues innovating on AI.\n\nA wide moat won’t protect the firm from industry weakness, though. With so many layoffs sweeping through tech in recent quarters, it should come as no surprise to see TEAM stock fall under pressure after the release of some disappointing quarterly results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock cratered more than 17% in a day following a weak quarter and guide. The recent post-earnings slip is a buying opportunity for investors seeking entry into one of the best behind-the-scenes names in software.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Mobile phone with logo of American pharmaceutical company Moderna Inc. (MRNA) on screen in front of website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock has been crashing violently of late. Just last week, the stock imploded more than 28%. If that’s not a vicious sell-off, I don’t know what is. Undoubtedly, the mRNA vaccine superstar has recently been a rough ride for investors as demand for COVID-19 vaccines fell rapidly.\n\nWith the RSV vaccine falling short of efficacy expectations, Moderna needs something else to give its stock a booster. For now, an updated COVID-19 shot isn’t going to cut it.\n\nIn any case, I find the $33.3 billion mRNA innovator trading at a nice discount after last week’s crash, partially induced by its full-year sales guidance cut. At around 7.1 times price-to-sales (P/S), the stock looks oversold and potentially undervalued, especially after clocking in some decent second-quarter earnings overshadowed by the reduced guidance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in Apple The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks.

        "title": "The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data",
        "content": "Market whiplash\n\nLast week started out with disappointing results from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the middle of the week both Fed commentary which nearly confirmed a September rate cut and outstanding Meta (NASDAQ:META) results lifted markets, only to be undone on Thursday and Friday by weaker-than-expected jobs data.\n\nEarnings season continues to plod along, with more companies beating earnings per share estimates than the long-run historical average, yet the amount by which these companies are beating is less than usual. Mega tech results, closely watched for signs of continuing artificial intelligence demand, came in mixed. In addition to AI updates, there were other key metrics that investors were watching closely. For Microsoft, slowing cloud revenues caused investor's to punish the stock after the report.[1] Meta shares were rewarded after they reported strong ad revs and better-than-expected revenue guidance for Q3.[2] By contrast, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock took a leg lower after reporting waning ad revenues.[3] Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the wild card here, and although sales in China continued to bottom-out, better-than-expected revenues for the iPhone and Services segments led to an uptick after the report.[4]\n\nAccording to FactSet, the current consensus for S&P 500 earnings per share growth is for 11.50% year over year, an increase from 9.80% last week.[5] Thus far 78% of companies that have reported have surpassed analyst profit estimates, while only 59% have beaten on revenues.[6]\n\nThe FOMC meeting and economic data were also in focus this week. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell all but confirmed the first rate cut since 2020 would likely occur at the September meeting.[7] There is also a high probability of rate cuts at the November and December meetings as well according to the CME FedWatch tool.[8] An additional three cuts are expected in the first half of 2025.\n\nNow the question is becoming whether or not the Fed waited too long to cut rates as certain economic indicators show signs of weakening. On Tuesday, the June JOLTS report showed that job openings slowed for the month, and both hiring and quit rates decreased.[9] The cooling jobs data continued on Thursday when Initial Jobless Claims came in higher-than-expected for the week prior.[10] It all culminated with a disappointing June jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) of 114,000 were well-below expectations, unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate in nearly three years, and wage growth grew less than anticipated.[11] In response, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were all down more than 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe final (and busiest) peak week of the second-quarter season is up\n\nThis week concludes the final peak week for the second quarter earnings season with 3,908 companies expected to report from a smattering of industries. Big names include: Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Disney (NYSE:DIS), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Reddit (NYSE:RDDT), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and more.? The Final Peak Week of the 2nd-Quarter Season Begins Amid Souring Economic Data\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[12]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their second-quarter 2024 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Fifteen companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), CSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX), IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX), DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), MarketAxess Holdings (NASDAQ:MKTX), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT), NiSource Inc (NYSE:NI), Global Payments, Inc. (NYSE:GPN), Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK), Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) and Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD).\n\nCSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Monday Aug. 5, AMCProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Thursday July 18, AMCDateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nCSX is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Monday, Aug. 5, over two weeks later than usual, and the first time they've ever reported the second quarter in the month of August. This also appears to be their first Monday report in at least the last decade, as they usually favor a Tuesday or Wednesday report date.\n\nOn March 26, a massive container ship crashed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse and closing the port for the majority of the second quarter. Baltimore is the second-largest coal export port, and CSX has a major coal shipping segment which was negatively impacted by the closing of the port.[13] In the quarters prior to this disaster, CSX and its peers have been dealing with a global freight recession, which experts believe has bottomed, but freight rates will likely remain low in 2025 on the road to recovery.\n\nCaterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday August 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nCaterpillar is set to report second-quarter 2024 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. This also pushed results into the 32nd week of the year, while the industrials giant tends to report in the 30th or 31st week of the year. This would be the latest second-quarter report ever for CAT.\n\nCaterpillar tends to serve as a bellwether for global economic health as the world's leading manufacturer of machinery and construction equipment. Last quarter the company warned that sales were cooling as dealers tightened up on equipment inventories after a multi-month boom in demand.[14] Investor's will be looking for updates on machinery sales which could indicate something broader about the global economy.\n\nVF Corp. (NYSE:VFC)\n\nCompany Confirmed Report Date: Tuesday Aug. 6, BMOProjected Report Date (based on historical data): Tuesday, July 30, BMODateBreaks Factor: -2*\n\nVF Corp. is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2025 results on Tuesday, Aug. 6, a week later than anticipated. Since switching to a fiscal year end of March 31 in 2018, this is the latest they've reported first-quarter results, and the first time they've reported them in the 32nd week of the year.\n\nOn May 22, VFC announced they had tapped Spotify's Paul Vogel as their new CFO.[15] Vogel took his post on July 8, which could explain the later than usual earnings date. VFC like many other apparel companies has struggled this year to attract consumers that are increasingly more discerning with how they spend their discretionary dollars, especially as many of the brands they own (North Face, Vans, Timberland) tend to be on the middle-higher end.\n\nSecond-quarter earnings wave\n\nThis marks the final peak week of the second-quarter earnings season, with 3,908 companies expected to report.

        "title": "Nasdaq 100 Posts Its Worst Drop Since 2022 as Selloff Deepens",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 is set for its biggest opening drop in more than four years, with investors bracing for days of volatility amid rising concerns over a slowing US economy and overheated gains in the tech sector.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts\n\nContracts on the Nasdaq 100 fell as much as 6.5% before paring losses to about 4.5%. That puts the tech-heavy index on track for its worst open since the pandemic days of March 2020. S&P 500 futures were down 2.7% while those tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.6%.\n\nMegacap technology stocks bore the brunt of the selloff, with chipmaker Nvidia Corp. falling more than 9% and Apple Inc. down almost 8%. Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. declined at least 4% each.\n\nConcerns over health of the US economy took center stage after Friday’s data pointed to rising unemployment levels in July, triggering a closely watched recession indicator and stoking fears that the Federal Reserve hasn’t moved quickly enough to cut interest rates. Investors bid up haven assets such as the yen, while Cboe VIX August futures spiked.\n\n“With the summer low liquidity, the still heavy trend plays that need unwinding and the VIX sky-high, this selloff move could go on for a few days,” said Florian Ielpo, head of macro research at Lombard Odier Asset Management. Still, “the macro picture itself is not as bad as the market seems to think.”\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 dropped into a correction Friday as investors fret over elevated valuations and the high cash outlay for investments in artificial intelligence. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has already pulled back 22% from a peak, even before Monday’s open.\n\nNews that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slashed its stake in Apple by almost 50% in the second quarter further drove risk-off sentiment on the tech sector. Slow monetization of AI tools — a long standing concern among tech investors — persists as the first preview of Apple Intelligence failed to live up to the hype.\n\nThe AI supply chain was dealt with another blow amid reports that Nvidia’s highly-anticipated Blackwell chips will be delayed due to design flaws. The chips may be postponed by three months or more, which could potentially hit big tech firms from Meta to Microsoft, the Information reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Jitters\n\n“In these sorts of scenarios, investors need to be careful,” said Ben Barringer, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot. “When sentiment begins to sour, the falls become more extreme than perhaps they should be. The next few weeks is likely to be a volatile one for tech stocks as this new environment plays out.”\n\nTurbulence in Japan — where the central bank has started to raise interest rates as the Fed looks to cut — is also having ripple effects across global markets of various asset classes. This is due to moves to reverse carry trades, in which investors had borrowed at lower rates in Japan to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets elsewhere.\n\n“With yen carry trades now being unwound quickly, not only has the Japanese currency notably broken its depreciation trend against all major units, but risk assets that those trades were financed with are also being sold off,” wrote Asymmetric Advisors strategist Amir Anvarzadeh, in a note to clients.\n\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli.\n\n(Updates with fresh comments in fifth, ninth and last paragraphs)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama How to Calculate the Value of an MBA Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here’s Why Bulls are Wrong About Apple (AAPL) — And Probably Why Warren Buffett is Dumping the Stock",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe much-feared correction in mega-cap tech stocks is here as investors keep pulling out of AI winners to pile into small-cap stocks as possible rate cuts from the Federal Reserve near. Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming. However, Thill reiterated his view that in the back half of the year things will start to change and tech companies will start their rebound. The analyst cited a few software earnings that suggest no signs of “demand cracks.” He said that many semiconductor stocks are now in the overbought territory.\n\nBrent Thill said the selloff has made software stocks more “attractive.”\n\nBut Thill also sees a broader rotation ongoing in the stock market, where sectors like financials and industrials are benefitting amid investor exodus from tech.\n\nAsked what is causing a sudden rebound in small-cap stocks, Thill said that interest rate cut expectations and a broader rotation out of mega-cap stocks have a role to play here, in addition to the M&A activity which has increased significantly recently.\n\nThill thinks the AI “payoff” time is still years away and companies are still at the beginning of the AI spending curve.\n\nFor this article we compiled the biggest AI news updates and analyst rating upgrades/downgrades around AI stocks over the past few days. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Among the Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI initiative Apple Intelligence has started to make sense to Wall Street analysts. Recently, Baird raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $200, citing a potential upgrade cycle in iPhone because of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence.\n\nMarket's Huge Assumption About Apple\n\nBaird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Latest AI Stock News and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Elon Musk Says Warren Buffett Is 'Clearly Expecting A Correction' After Berkshire Sold Nearly Half Of Its Apple Stock\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has commented on Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.‘s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) decision to sell about half its stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nWhat Happened: Over the weekend, a user on X, formerly Twitter, shared the news of Berkshire accumulating a cash reserve of almost $277 billion on the platform.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nThe user humorously suggested that Buffett could make daring, all-in investments with this cash reserve, and acquire any of these companies: Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Adobe, and Hermes.\n\nIn response to the user, Musk said, “He [Buffett] is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills.”\n\nThe tech mogul also criticized the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, suggesting that the current rates are too high.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\n“The Fed needs to drop rates. They have been foolish not to have done so already,” he stated.\n\nHe is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills. \r\n\r\nThe Fed needs to drop rates. They have been foolish not to have done so already.\n\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 4, 2024\n\nWhy It Matters: Circuit breakers were triggered for Japan's TOPIX index, halting trading as the index dropped over 6%, leading to urgent stabilization measures on Sunday night.\n\nThe broader Asia-Pacific region saw declines, with the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index falling 2%, Japan's Nikkei 225 plummeting 5.60%, and South Korea's KOSPI index dropping 4%.\n\nSee Also:Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nThis continued a trend from Friday, when Japan's Nikkei 225 and TOPIX both fell over 5% and 6%, respectively. In the U.S., markets faced significant losses on Friday due to a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, with the Nasdaq dropping over 10%, and the S&P 500 and Dow decreasing by 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively. At the time of writing, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 0.81%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 1.43% and 2.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, Berkshire Hathaway’s second-quarter net earnings fell year-over-year due to a decline in investment gains, despite an increase in operating earnings. The company continued to offload its stake in Apple during this period.\n\nSee Also:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nIn the second quarter, net earnings experienced a 15.50% decline year-over-year, dropping from $35.91 billion to $30.35 billion. On the other hand, operating earnings—reflecting income from the company’s portfolio entities—increased by 15.48%, reaching $11.60 billion.\n\nGains from the investment portfolio saw a significant decrease of 27.52%, falling to $18.75 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire’s swelling cash position has also led to speculation on social media about potential investments, with some Tesla fans hoping that Buffett would invest in the electric vehicle maker’s stock.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast — No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -2.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.3%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.51 indicates a change of +13% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $94.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $390.32 billion and $418.87 billion estimates indicate +1.8% and +7.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "AI bubble has started to implode: Gavekal Research",
        "content": "Gavekal Research analysts suggested in a note Monday that the recent market turmoil signals the start of the AI bubble's implosion.\n\nInvestors have witnessed significant losses across stocks, currencies, and commodities, with the tech sector particularly hard-hit.\n\nAccording to Gavekal, multiple factors contribute to this decline, including the US economy seemingly stalling, Chinese economic disappointment, and the implosion of the yen carry trade.\n\nAdditionally, geopolitical tensions and political uncertainties in the US and Europe have exacerbated market instability.\n\nThe firm says that one of the clearest indicators of the AI bubble's burst is the discrepancy between tech companies' promises and their performance.\n\n\"A couple of quarters ago, tech companies were falling over themselves to tell investors how AI would soon boost sales and earnings into the stratosphere,\" Gavekal notes.\n\nHowever, recent earnings reports reveal that despite significant investments, AI has yet to deliver the anticipated financial returns. This revelation comes at a time when many tech giants are struggling to meet investor expectations.\n\nThey add that the market's confidence was further shaken by two major announcements: Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) slashing its holdings of Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) by half, and \"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announcing it will shed 15,000 workers, 20% of its workforce.\n\nThese moves raise questions about the health of the tech sector.\n\nGavekal states: \"Today, if the world is about to embark on a future of massive AI spending which justifies paying nine times book value for the global semiconductor index, why does Intel have to fire a fifth of its staff?\"\n\nThey add: \"If the US really has cut the legs out from under China's semiconductor industry, then why are shares in one of the US national semiconductor champions, which in recent years has benefited from massive government largesse, collapsing to an 11-year low?\"\n\nDrawing parallels to the 2008 financial crisis, Gavekal suggests that these developments could signal a broader downturn in the tech industry. The analysts argue that just as the 2008 crisis exposed the vulnerabilities of the banking sector, current events may reveal the overvaluation and unsustainable promises within the AI and tech sectors.\n\nUltimately, Gavekal believes its assessment leaves investors with a critical decision: either view the recent news as temporary noise or acknowledge a fundamental shift in the tech market's trajectory.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nAI bubble has started to implode: Gavekal Research\n\nBofA cuts Delta estimates on CrowdStrike outage\n\nWall St set to tumble as recession worries spook investors\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) has experienced its worst-ever daily selloff on Monday, amid panic selling triggered by fears of a possible US recession that is spilling over to European markets.\n\nAt the close in Tokyo on Monday, the benchmark index was down 4,451.28 points, or 12.40%, to 31,458.42.\n\nIt is the largest point fall ever, eclipsing the decline on 20 October 1987, the day after Black Monday in New York. It is the second largest decline in percentage terms, according to Nikkei data.\n\nThe panic selling extended across Asia, with markets in Singapore (^STI), Indonesia (^JKSE), Thailand (^SET.BK), and the Philippines (PSEI.PS) also experiencing drops of 2% to 3%. These declines triggered circuit breakers, temporarily halting trading for 20 minutes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks dip as Japan's Nikkei slumps\n\nJapanese finance minister Shunichi Suzuki expressed \"grave concern\" as the government closely monitors the market situation.\n\nAsian markets getting hammered this morning.

There are a lot of moving parts, but this is the essence of things: a looming slowdown in the US economy has cast doubts about global economic growth.\n\n\"The move has triggered a sell-off in the US dollar and a rally in the yen, the latter of which was boosted by the BOJ’s [Bank of Japan's] decision to tighten policy last week and a subsequent short-squeeze.\n\n“The rapid move in the yen is putting downward pressure on Japanese equities, but it’s also driving an unwind of a major carry trade – investors had leveraged up by borrowing in yen to buy other assets, chiefly US tech stocks. We are basically seeing a mass deleveraging as investors sell assets to fund their losses.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Disney, Airbnb, Bitcoin, Pershing Square\n\n“The rapidity of the move has caught a lot of investors off guard; there’s a lot of panic selling now, which is what causes these non-linear reactions in asset prices to pretty straightforward fundamental dynamics.”\n\nThe market rout has spilled over, with US treasury yields falling further, European stock indexes in the red, bitcoin dumped and the dollar losing ground mainly to the yen.\n\nLondon’s blue-chip index (^FTSE) was as much as 2.22% down, losing 196 points to hit 7,978.59 at the time of writing, with equities across the board falling into the red. It is the sharpest fall in London’s benchmark index since July last year.\n\nThe Dax (^GDAXI) in Frankfurt sank more than 2.6% while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris slumped 2.3%. Elsewhere, Milan (FTSEMIB.MI) plunged 3.1% and Madrid (^IBEX) gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency (BTC-USD) fell by 15% to $51,400, adding to a 13.1% drop last week.\n\nIt has suffered its worst fall since the so-called “crypto winter” when the FTX exchange imploded in 2022.\n\n#Bitcoin is down more than 16% in the past 24 hours. This is a stark reminder that Bitcoin is, by far, the asset class with the highest #volatility, which must be considered when constructing a portfolio that includes Bitcoin.\r\n(The Bitcoin Emergency Brake in the Blokland Smart… pic.twitter.com/5b6jDkNgEr\n\n— jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) August 5, 2024\n\nBig Tech stocks are heading for further losses when Wall Street trading begins.

At the time, it also marked the sharpest market downturn in the US since the Great Depression.\n\nThe Fed was forced to act, slashing interest rates and providing liquidity support, to help stabilise markets.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple and Nvidia led a sell-off in technology stocks on Monday as U.S. recession fears and Berkshire Hathaway's decision to cut its stake in the iPhone maker punctured a months-long rally in the sector.\n\nHigh-performing shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla fell as much as 12.2% in premarket trading.\n\nThe losses in the Magnificent Seven stocks were set to wipe out nearly $1 trillion from the combined market value of the companies.\n\nChip stocks, the big winners of Wall Street's picks and shovels trade for AI, also tumbled, with Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Super Micro Computer and Broadcom falling as much as 10.3%.\n\nThe share slide followed a weak U.S. payrolls report on Friday that pushed investors to safe assets and spurred bets that the Federal Reserve will have to soon cut interest rates to aid growth.\n\nOver the weekend, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had halved its stake in Apple - the conglomerate's top holding - in a stock-selling spree that raised worries about the outlook for the tech industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia shares took a hit from a report that the launch of its upcoming AI chips could be delayed by three months due to design flaws, which could impact customers such as Facebook-parent Meta, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft.\n\nAfter driving gains on Wall Street for more than a year, big technology stocks have come under pressure in the past few weeks also on signs that the payoff from hefty AI investments would take longer than some investors had initially hoped.\n\nShares of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet - the three biggest providers of cloud-computing services - fell as their earnings reports dashed big bets of hefty AI investments translating quickly into growth.\n\n\"Expectations have arguably become too high for the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Their success has made them untouchable in the eyes of investors and when they fall short of greatness, out come the knives,\" Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "ETFs in Focus as Buffett Cuts Apple Stake by Nearly 50%",
        "content": "In its second-quarter earnings report released recently, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge reduction in its stake in Apple AAPL. Previously holding 790 million shares, Berkshire now has 400 million shares, marking a nearly 50% decline. This move is notable given Warren Buffett's long-standing association with Apple shares.\n\nRecord Cash Pile Amid Selling Spree\n\nDespite reducing its Apple holdings, Berkshire Hathaway reported a record cash pile of nearly $277 billion for the second quarter of 2024. This marks an increase from about $189 billion in cash and equivalents reported in the first quarter.\n\nIn addition to Apple, Berkshire Hathaway also reduced its stake in its second-largest position, Bank of America, to $41.1 billion. The conglomerate sold off $75.5 billion in stocks during the second quarter, further shaping its investment portfolio.\n\nInside Apple’s Latest Earnings Results\n\nApple reported robust third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein it beat both earnings and revenue estimates.  The iPhone manufacturer returned to revenue growth and pinned hopes on AI for iPhone upgrades.\n\nThe tech giant is set to launch a host of AI-theme initiatives heading into the release of its iPhone 16 later this fall. The next model, the iPhone 16, is expected to be equipped with an AI chip, which would spur iPhone upgrades in the coming months, helping the company re-emerge from a sales slowdown that has hit its China business hard (read: Apple Beats on Q3 Earnings, Pins Hopes on AI: ETFs to Buy).\n\nWhat Probably Went Wrong?\n\nInvestors should note that Apple shares are lagging behind its other big tech peers due to its lack of dependence on artificial intelligence. And now, tech companies have been shelling out billions on AI initiatives have been showing lackluster results as investors are anticipating later-than-expected return on investment in AI. So, there has been an “AI fatigue” in Wall Street.\n\nProbably sensing that, Buffett cut his stake in Apple. The Apple stock has a downbeat Value Score of “D.” Apple has an expected growth rate of 8.32% for this year versus the underlying Zacks industry Micro Computers’ growth rate of 19.80%.\n\nFor the next year, Apple is likely to record a 13.10% growth rate versus the industry growth rate of 20.20%. If you are worried about Buffett’s recent move and Apple’s weaker growth momentum, you might stay out of Apple stock.\n\nPrice Target\n\nBut then, Apple has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on short-term price targets offered by 32 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $234.00. The forecasts range from a low of $180.00 to a high of $300.00. The average price target represents an increase of 7.16% from the last closing price of $218.36 recorded on Aug 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nHence, if you want to go by the bullish Zacks Rank, you might play Apple-heavy ETFs like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW. Since there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple’s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Moreover, the AI sector is seen as entering a new growth phase, reminiscent of the early days of the internet.\n\nThis earnings season has reinforced Wedbush's positive outlook, with strong performances and optimistic forecasts from major tech players.\n\nThey note that companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have shown robust cloud growth, and the AI monetization phase is gaining momentum.\n\n\"We focus on tech spending and the winners that will be front and center in this massive AI tech buildout,\" Wedbush emphasizes.\n\n\"We would strongly focus more on what is happening at the likes at Apple (bullish conf. call and outlook from Cook), Nvidia, Microsoft (Azure 2H accel), Alphabet, Amazon (AWS monster number), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) as barometers and see the forest through the trees despite this morning's carnage,\" they concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStory continues\n\nNow not the time to panic on the tech trade, bargain hunt after selloff: Wedbush\n\nElon Musk revives lawsuit against Sam Altman and OpenAI, filing shows\n\nTyson Foods beats Q3 estimates, shares rise on strong results\n\nView comments",

        "content": "While the current buzzword for the hottest tech stocks might be the \"Magnificent Seven,\" that could soon turn into the Terrific Three.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) have put a considerable amount of daylight between themselves and the remainder of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft, and Apple all have market caps in the range of $3 trillion, and all are among the leaders in the AI revolution in different ways.\n\nNvidia is the leading chipmaker, building the AI infrastructure that is powering new large language models and applications like ChatGPT. More than any other company, Nvidia has defined the current AI era, and its stock has been the biggest gainer based on market cap.\n\nMicrosoft has established itself as a leader in AI applications thanks to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft has invested an estimated $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker, and it has forged a close partnership with OpenAI, which has allowed it to deploy ChatGPT across a wide range of products, including Azure, its Office suite, GitHub, and Bing, and the AI-based Copilot, as well as other AI tools already driving meaningful growth for Microsoft.\n\nFinally, Apple has been somewhat late to the AI party, but the iPhone maker can't be ignored when it comes to a new technology like AI. That's because Apple has an installed base of active devices of 2.2 billion, meaning that it controls the connectivity to AI for billions of users. Apple is also releasing Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools like a writing assistant, which is expected to be available to consumers shortly. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple stack up against each other\n\nAs the descriptions show, all three of these companies have their own strengths in AI, and all three stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 in the AI era. However, Nvidia has been the clear winner during that time, as the chart below shows. NVDA data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia is also the most expensive stock of the three based on its trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 65, compared to Microsoft at 37 and Apple at 33.\n\nHowever, Nvidia is also the fastest-growing of the three stocks and is expected to grow revenue by 98% this year, compared to Microsoft at 16% and Apple at 8%.\n\nBecause of that, Nvidia' forward P/E is much lower, at just 40, bringing it more in line with that of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nWhich is the best AI play?\n\nOf the three stocks, Nvidia's future is the most closely tied to AI. Its revenue more than tripled over its last four quarters as it's become the de facto supplier of GPUs and other components needed for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's also moving fast to release new products and stay on the cutting edge of AI and ahead of the competition. The company just announced a suite of services and computing platforms to help build the next generation of humanoid robots.\n\nAdditionally, the company recently launched its new Blackwell platform, which can process trillion-parameter large language models at as much as 25 times less cost and energy than Nvidia's previous Hopper architecture.\n\nNvidia has executed nearly perfectly since the beginning of the generative AI era, and the company looks like a good bet to continue to dominate the market for AI hardware.\n\nWhile Microsoft and Apple both have their own strengths in AI, they don't have the same level of exposure to AI that Nvidia does, and they haven't demonstrated the same ability to develop new AI technology.\n\nIf you're bullish on AI, Nvidia looks like the best stock of the three to own today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett's Selling Over $3.8 Billion Worth of Bank of America Stock in 2 Weeks Is an Ominous and Unmistakable Warning for Wall Street",
        "content": "Among Wall Street's billionaire investors, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is, arguably, in a class of his own. In a world where investors are using advanced charting software and artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to gain a competitive edge, Buffett and his team have relied on old-school fundamental metrics and detective work to locate amazing businesses.\n\nSince taking the reins as CEO in 1965, the aptly dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a nearly 5,200,000% cumulative return for Berkshire's Class A shareholders (BRK.A). It's no surprise why professional and everyday investors often wait on pins and needles for details of which stocks Buffett and his team have been buying and selling. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nAlthough Berkshire Hathaway's Form 13F -- the document that tells investors what Wall Street's top money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter -- is due out in a little over a week, investors don't always have to wait a full three months for clues as to what Buffett and his team have been up to. For instance, when Berkshire holds a 10% or greater stake in a public company, it's required to file Form 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every time shares are purchased or sold.\n\nRecent Form 4 filings from Berkshire point to an ominous and unmistakable warning to Wall Street from the Oracle of Omaha and his trusty investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.\n\nWarren Buffett has sold shares of Bank of America stock for 12 consecutive trading sessions\n\nFor years, banking giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) has maintained its standing as the second-largest holding in Berkshire's 44-stock, $395 billion investment portfolio, behind only tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nThe cyclical nature of financial stocks -- i.e., the fact that they can take advantage of economic expansions lasting substantially longer than recessions -- coupled with their robust capital-return programs, makes them attractive to the Oracle of Omaha. Bank of America, in particular, is the most interest-sensitive among America's largest money-center banks. It's enjoyed an outsized benefit to its net-interest income following the Federal Reserve's most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades.\n\nHowever, Buffett's love affair with Bank of America appears to be in question. Four recently filed Form 4s with the SEC show that Berkshire Hathaway's brightest investment minds have sold shares of BofA stock for 12 consecutive trading sessions (July 17-Aug. 1). Altogether, 90,422,124 shares of Bank of America stock were sold, totaling proceeds of roughly $3.82 billion.\n\nThere are a number of legitimate reasons for Buffett and his investment crew to have reduced Berkshire's stake in Bank of America by about 9% in two weeks.\n\nProfit-taking is one possible answer. During Berkshire's most recent annual shareholder meeting, Buffett opined that corporate tax rates were liable to climb in the future. The prospect of higher corporate tax rates coerced the sale of more than 116 million shares of Apple during the first quarter, along with a nearly 50% reduction in the tech goliath in second quarter, and may be encouraging a reduction in BofA during the third quarter.\n\nBank of America's interest sensitivity might also explain 12 consecutive business days of selling activity. Just as BofA enjoyed an outsized benefit from rising interest rates, the expectation of a rate-easing cycle kicking off in September could lead to its net-interest income shrinking faster than its peers.\n\nBut more than anything, 12 straight days of selling Bank of America stock appears to signal that value is getting tougher to come by on Wall Street. With BofA now trading above its book value, which is something of a rarity over the last 15 years, it may simply not be as attractive to the Oracle of Omaha and/or his team. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett wants no part of the Wall Street \"casino\"\n\nBelieve it or not, Buffett's mammoth sales in both Apple and Bank of America were somewhat telegraphed earlier this year when the Oracle or Omaha published his annual letter to shareholders. While this letter is often used to promote a long-term ethos and praise Berkshire's \"forever\" holdings, it also served as a cautionary tale for the investing community.\n\nIn his 2023 letter to shareholders, Buffett spoke of casino-like behavior that he wants no part of. Said Berkshire's chief:\n\nThough the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today's active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\n\nWhile I can't read minds, this sounds like a roundabout admission that stocks are pricey. In his nearly six decades as CEO, Buffett has emphasized patience in waiting for amazing businesses to fall to attractive price points. The $277 billion (and growing) in collective cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on Berkshire's balance sheet (as of June 30) points to the lack of value the Oracle of Omaha and his crew are seeing.\n\nTo add to this point, Warren Buffett has been a net-seller of equities for seven consecutive quarters, as of June 30, 2024 (dollar figure represents net-selling activity for a listed quarter):\n\nQ4 2022: $14.64 billion Q1 2023: $10.41 billion Q2 2023: $7.981 billion Q3 2023: $5.253 billion Q4 2023: $0.525 billion Q1 2024: $17.281 billion Q2 2024: $75.536 billion\n\nFor those of you without calculators handy, this equates to $131.6 billion in cumulative net-selling activity since Oct. 1, 2022.\n\nThe reality for Buffett, along with investors as a whole, is that the stock market is historically pricey. S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\n\nThe S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is also commonly known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (Cape ratio), recently hit a level that's been observed only a handful of times over the last 153 years.\n\nWhereas most investors are probably familiar with the traditional P/E ratio, which divides a company's share price into its trailing-12-month earnings per share, the Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings from the prior 10 years. Using 10 years of earnings history smooths out the effect of one-off events that could otherwise adversely affect valuation models.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2024, the Shiller P/E ended at 35.13. There have only been six occasions since the beginning of 1871 where the S&P 500's Shiller P/E surpassed 30 during a bull market rally. Following the five prior incidences, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and/or Nasdaq Composite all plunged by 20% to 89%. Although the Shiller P/E ratio offers no assistance forecasting when big declines will occur on Wall Street, this valuation metric has a flawless track record of portending trouble for Wall Street.\n\nWarren Buffett's willingness to back away from the proverbial casino and meaningfully pare down his company's leading stakes in Apple and now Bank of America strongly suggests he's struggling to find value. This is a concern investors would be wise not to ignore.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Chipmakers crushed on US recession concerns",
        "content": "Shares in chipmakers plummeted significantly on Monday amid a global market sell-off, with Japanese stocks plunging by more than 12% due to growing concerns over a potential U.S. recession.\n\nThe fears spurred investors to flee from riskier assets, betting that a series of swift rate cuts might be necessary to support economic growth.\n\nSafe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc saw substantial gains as investors unwound crowded carry trades, leading to speculation that some were selling profitable positions to cover losses elsewhere. The intensity of the sell-off triggered circuit breakers across Asian exchanges.\n\nSemiconductor stocks, many of which enjoyed substantial gains in recent years driven by the AI boom, fell sharply in premarket trading Monday. The AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was down 9% at the time of writing, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged 5%, 4% and 4.6%.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 6.5%, Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) tumbled 7.6%, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) dipped 5%.\n\nBut the sell-off extends much beyond chipmakers, with Nasdaq 100 Futures futures tumbling 4.7%, and S&P 500 futures falling 2.8%, reflecting the global nature of the market turmoil.\n\nEUROSTOXX 50 futures declined 2.1%, while FTSE futures slipped 1.2%. Japan's Nikkei dropped a staggering 12.4%, reaching seven-month lows, a level of decline not seen since the 2011 financial crisis.\n\nThe MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 4.2%. Chinese blue chips, however, were relatively resilient, dipping only 0.5%, helped by a rise in the Caixin services PMI to 52.1.\n\nJapanese 10-year bond yields fell sharply by 17 basis points to 0.788%, the lowest since April, as markets re-evaluated the likelihood of another rate hike from the Bank of Japan.\n\nU.S. Treasury bonds were in high demand, with United States 10-Year dropping to 3.767%, the lowest since mid-2023. United States 2-Year decreased to 3.818%, and the yield curve could soon invert, a pattern historically associated with recessions.\n\nThe weak July payrolls report has led markets to price in a 78% chance that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September by a full 50 basis points. Futures suggest a total of 122 basis points in cuts for the year, with rates expected to be around 3.0% by the end of 2025.\n\n\"We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,\" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note, adding that the risk is somewhat mitigated by the Fed's ability to ease policy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street bank now anticipates quarter-point cuts in September, November, and December.\n\n\"The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks. If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September,” analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan was more pessimistic, assigning a 50% probability of a U.S. recession.\n\n\"Now that the Fed looks to be materially behind the curve, we expect a 50bp cut at the September meeting, followed by another 50bp cut in November,\" said the bank’s economists.\n\nThe significant drop in Treasury yields has overshadowed the U.S. dollar's typical safe-haven appeal, dragging the currency down 1.1% against a basket of major currencies. The dollar fell 2% against the yen to 143.10, while the euro dropped 1.9% to 156.35 yen. However, the euro held steady against the dollar at $1.0934.\n\nInvestors also increased bets that other major central banks would follow the Fed's lead and ease policy more aggressively, with the European Central Bank now expected to cut rates by 67 basis points by Christmas.\n\nIn the commodity markets, gold traded relatively flat at $2,431.62.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmakers crushed on US recession concerns\n\nStocks trampled, Nikkei tumbles past Black Monday milestone\n\nEuropean stocks plunge on recession fears\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway's Massive $277M Cash Hoard Rekindles Tesla Investment Chatter: Fund Manager Says 'Two Worlds Seldom Collide'\n\nWarren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.‘s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) second-quarter 10-Q report filed with the SEC showed that the investment holding company’s cash position swelled to $277 million. The cash buildup sent social media into a tizzy, with some Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) fans fervently hoping that the investment guru would divert some of it into the electric-vehicle maker’s stock.\n\nWhat Happened: “Buffett is a value investor. $TSLA is a growth stock,” said The Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black in a post on X. Black, who is a Tesla bull, was referring to Buffett’s investment rationale of picking up quality stocks trading at bargains, which is the premise behind value investing.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Don’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\n\nGrowth stocks, on the other hand, are expected to generate above-market returns and these stocks trade at elevated price-earnings multiples. Their high valuations are justified only by the returns they can generate in the future.\n\nDespite Tesla stock’s secular decline seen since late 2022, it still trades at an elevated forward P/E multiple of 84.75, according to the Yahoo Finance database.\n\nSource: Benzinga Pro data\n\nSee Also: America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\nNever The Twain Shall Meet: “The two worlds seldom collide,” said Black in the post, referring to Buffett’s ideology and Tesla’s stock characteristic. Clarifying further, the fund manager said Buffett first bought Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock when it traded at less than 12 times earnings and BYD Co. Ltd (OTC:BYDDY) (OTC:BYDDY) stock when it was trading at less than 10 times earnings.\n\nTesla “isn’t his type [of] stock,” said Black.\n\nIncidentally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has in the past resented that Buffett and his trusted late lieutenant Charlie Munger had overlooked Tesla as an investment option. Musk has mentioned an unsuccessful meeting with Munger in 2009 regarding a potential Tesla investment.\n\nEvery time Berkshire’s massive cash position is being discussed on social media, the world’s richest man has indirectly nudged Buffett to take a stake in Tesla. Buffett, while giving Tesla a snub, has admired Musk. “Elon is a brilliant, brilliant guy and I would say that he might score over a 100%,” Buffett said at one Berkshire shareholder meeting. “He dreams about things and his dream have got a foundation.”\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla ended Friday’s session down 4.24% at $207.67, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHere’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "AI market darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has cooled off, dropping roughly 15% since peaking at a $3.3 trillion market cap just a few weeks ago. Despite the recent stumble, the stock has gained over 100% over the past year. Volatility is normal for any stock that rises so much in a short amount of time.\n\nBut Nvidia's current dip isn't an automatic buying opportunity. Question marks are starting to pile up as the company prepares to announce second-quarter earnings in a few weeks.\n\nHere are the risks investors should consider before buying the stock today.\n\nIs Nvidia's market share under attack?\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) race began in early 2023 with the viral arrival of ChatGPT. Nvidia's GPUs, which can optimize for AI applications using proprietary software, quickly established a dominant market share. Industry estimates have pegged Nvidia's AI market share as high as 70% to 95%. Research from TechInsights estimates Nvidia accounted for 98% of total data center GPU revenue in 2023.\n\nNvidia's financials back that up; revenue growth accelerated to nearly 300%. Technology CEOs like Elon Musk openly pleaded they couldn't get Nvidia's chips fast enough. Such high demand has done wonders for Nvidia's pricing power, too. Gross profit margins have expanded significantly to over 75%: NVDA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nBut it's hard staying on top when everyone is coming for your crown, and many of these big chip spenders may not enjoy being at Nvidia's mercy. It's known that competitors like Intel and AMD are pushing alternatives, and big technology companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are building custom AI chips.\n\nAlphabet may have struck the first known blow to Nvidia's dominance. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently disclosed that it used 2,048 of Alphabet's TPU v5p chips to build the AI that will run on iOS devices. For its server AI model, Apple deployed 8,192 TPU v4 processors. These tensor processing units (TPUs) are purpose-built to train AI models. Apple didn't say it didn't use Nvidia chips, but omitted Nvidia when describing its hardware and software build.\n\nHeading into earnings with sky-high expectations\n\nApple's tie-up with Alphabet is significant for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, Apple's AI project is critically important, and the company chose Alphabet's chips despite the perception that Nvidia was the de facto industry leader and go-to chip vendor. It's just one instance, but it's now fair to question whether Nvidia's AI moat is as wide as initially thought.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, analysts' revenue estimates remain very optimistic despite potential competitive pressure. You can see that estimates for 2024 and 2025 are as high as ever: NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nThird, genuine competitive pressures would likely threaten Nvidia's gross profit margins, which (as you saw in the first chart) have expanded beyond 75%. Over the past five years, Nvidia's gross margins have averaged 63%. Even if Nvidia retains the lion's share of the AI chip market, it may no longer do so at any price. Prices may have to come down to compete.\n\nHow should investors approach Nvidia today?\n\nThe potential downside in both revenue and gross margins should concern investors. I'm not saying that Nvidia can't or won't remain the leading AI chip company. But it's becoming increasingly plausible that deep-pocketed competitors can win business. Many of these big technology companies building custom AI chips are currently Nvidia's largest customers!\n\nMaybe the broader demand for AI chips will be so great that Nvidia can grow while ceding some of its market share. The risk is that it can't, that Nvidia's AI revenue could peak and then moderate or even decline as other AI chips flood the market. Q2 earnings could easily be another blowout quarter. Investors will want to pay close attention to management's full-year guidance, which should reveal future sales momentum.\n\nNvidia could prove volatile as Wall Street chews on these questions. Investors may want to consider waiting to see how Q2 earnings look before aggressively buying shares. At the very least, consider dollar-cost averaging your Nvidia investments. That's a smart way to manage uncertain markets or falling stock prices. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can lower your average cost per share over time. This method helps you buy more when prices are low, offering a strategic advantage in volatile markets.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $657,306!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "'Warren Crushed Apple' Says Jim Cramer As Buffett Cuts Stake In Tech Giant By Nearly Half: Here's How Much Dividend Income Berkshire Forgoes\n\nBerkshire Hathaway‘s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) 10-Q report for the second quarter showed the Warren Buffett-led firm significantly reducing its stake in tech giant Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nWhat Happened: Berkshire said the fair value of its Apple holding at the end of the second quarter was $84.2 billion, down about 38% from $135.4 billion at the end of the first quarter. Looking at the reduction from the perspective of number of shares, the math works as follows:\n\nBerkshire had 789.37 million shares of Apple at the end of the March quarter (according to 13F filing) Apple’s average stock price for the June quarter was $186.14 and the stock ended the quarter at $210.62. The $84.2 billion worth of stake Berkshire disclosed in the 10-Q for the second quarter suggests Berkshire may have been left with 399.77 million shares (taking the closing price for the quarter).\n\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nThe math suggests a 49.36% reduction in Apple stake by Berkshire in terms of the number of shares.\n\nApple, which reported quarterly results Thursday, said its board declared a quarterly cash dividendof25cents per share, payable onAug. 15to shareholders of record as of Aug. 12. The 390-million shares Berkshire is estimated to have sold would have fetched the Buffett-led firm a dividend income of $97.5 million.\n\nIf Berkshire held onto the 789.37 million shares it owned at the end of the March quarter, it could have reaped a dividend windfall of a little over $197 million.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nCramer Explores Motive: Commenting on Berkshire’s action, CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer said Buffett’s decision may have been prompted by Apple’s China weakness. “Warren crushed Apple and the story is being viewed as ‘China risk,” he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Cramer apparently doesn’t subscribe to the idea. “Did anyone bother to read or see how well Apple did in China this q? Probably their relative best. Again, not defending this market or the stories, just offering a non-panicked perspective,” he said.\n\nApple reported a 6.54% year-over-year drop in Greater China revenues in the June quarter, and sequentially, the drop was a steeper 10%. CEO Tim Cook clarified on the call the weakness was due to macro conditions and domestic competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncidentally, when Berkshire trimmed its Apple position by 13% in the March quarter, Buffett said the move was to raise cash during times of economic uncertainty and to foot its federal tax bill.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDon’t miss out on the next Nvidia – you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.

        "title": "These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) is one of the three major performance-tracking indexes in the U.S. stock market, alongside the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Unlike its two peers, however, the Dow Jones is a much smaller index, tracking just 30 of America's largest companies. These companies come from most major sectors, except separately tracked areas such as utilities and real estate.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dow Jones has lagged behind the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite in the past decade. The good news, though, is that many of the companies within the index still are great investments on their own. ^IXIC Chart\n\nInvestors looking to add high-quality companies to their portfolio should consider the following two Dow Jones stocks, which have the ability to soar this year and beyond.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) may be almost synonymous with e-commerce at this point, but its business has expanded impressively over the years. The modest online bookstore has become a true big tech giant with its hands in many pots.\n\nAmazon has been able to fund its research and development and enter into new industries because of the cash flow its e-commerce business generates. In the first quarter, net sales from its North American and international segments were a combined $118.2 billion. That's more than Target generated in its last four quarters combined.\n\nAdd in the revenue from its successful cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Amazon brought in more revenue in the first quarter than Meta Platforms' last four quarters combined. The only company that tops Amazon's revenue is Walmart. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nRevenue is great, but you could argue that profit is even better, and that's where AWS comes into the picture.\n\nCloud services are a much more profitable business than e-commerce because many of the costs are fixed, and once a platform reaches a certain size, it benefits from the economics of scale. This seems to be the case for AWS, the world's most-used cloud platform and undisputed market leader with a 31% market share (Microsoft Azure is second with 25%).\n\nAs Amazon adds artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to AWS and continues to be a platform where companies can create their own generative AI and machine learning models, it should hold its top spot for quite some time, though Azure has been gaining ground.\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is around 3.28, which sits below its five-year average. That isn't necessarily \"cheap,\" but long-term investors can justify it, considering Amazon's potential growth areas.\n\nStory continues AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\n2. Apple\n\nAfter spending much of the past year away from the top spot, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has regained its title as the world's most valuable public company. While many top tech companies have seen huge stock price surges fueled by AI hype, Apple was noticeably exempt. In the past 12 months, it has underperformed the S&P 500.\n\nIt's no secret that Apple's finances are tied to the success of its iPhone sales, and that's been a thorn in its side recently, as global smartphone sales have slumped over the past few years. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite the seemingly stagnant past couple of years, there's light at the end of the tunnel. To begin, global smartphone sales are projected to rebound this year, which comes at a great time as Apple introduces its Apple Intelligence features in its next generation of hardware.\n\nThe second encouraging sign is the growth of Apple's services segment, which set a revenue record in the first quarter, generating close to $23.9 billion. Services offer higher margins than hardware products as well as provide more reliable revenue because a lot of it is subscription-based.\n\nServices may never overtake hardware as Apple's cash cow, but they're becoming a great complement to the ecosystem that many Apple loyalists (myself included) find themselves in.

        "title": "72% of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is Invested in These 5 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "How much does Warren Buffett like dividends? We shouldn't draw any conclusions from the fact that Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend. The correct answer to the question is that Buffett likes dividends a lot.\n\nWe can be confident in this answer, by the way. Why? Roughly 72% of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in just five dividend stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has ranked as Berkshire's largest holding for years. Although Buffett has sold a significant portion of his stake in Apple this year, including a notable reduction of nearly half recently, it's still Berkshire's top individual stock holding by far.\n\nTo be sure, Apple isn't known primarily as a dividend stock. Its forward dividend yield is a paltry 0.45%. However, the iPhone maker has paid and increased its dividend every year since 2012.\n\n2. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC) remains Buffett's second-biggest position, at least for now. That could soon change, though, with Buffett selling big chunks of his BofA position in recent days.\n\nWhile the legendary investor appears to have soured on Bank of America to some extent, he's probably still sweet on its dividend. BofA's forward dividend yield stands at nearly 2.6%. The financial services company has increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years.\n\n3. American Express\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP) could soon take the No. 2 spot away from Bank of America. However, it's currently Berkshire's third-largest holding.\n\nBuffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that American Express paid $302 million to Berkshire in 2022. He mentioned Amex again in his latest shareholder letter, saying that the company would increase its dividend payout by around 16% in 2024. He was close: The actual increase was 17%. American Express' dividend yields 1.1%.\n\n4. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nBerkshire has owned shares of The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) longer than any other stock. It's also one of the conglomerate's biggest positions. Buffett thinks that Coke is a \"truly wonderful business\" that Berkshire will \"maintain indefinitely.\"\n\nThat's good news for Berkshire's dividend income. Coca-Cola's forward dividend yield tops 2.9%. The company is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) is Buffett's fifth-largest holding. Although Buffett trimmed his position in the oil giant in the first quarter of 2024, the move followed a large purchase of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett doesn't own many high-yield dividend stocks, but Chevron is one of the few. Its forward dividend yield is a little shy of 4.1%. Chevron has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years.\n\nAre any of these stocks good picks for investors now?\n\nBuffett hasn't bought additional shares of any of these top five dividend stocks lately. However, I think two are good picks for investors right now.\n\nFirst, Apple could be poised for strong growth soon. The company's new generative AI capabilities only work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and newer models. There's a good chance, in my view, that a multi-year surge of iPhone upgrades could be on the way as customers buy new smartphones to take advantage of the artificial intelligence features.\n\nSecond, Chevron looks like a great choice for income investors. The company's dividend yield and track record of dividend hikes are impressive. I also like Chevron's potential growth opportunities in carbon capture and storage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRKa) results on Saturday showed that it sold about half its stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating profit.\n\nBerkshire sold approximately 390 million Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the second quarter, on top of 115 million sold from January to March, as the iPhone maker's stock price rose 23%.\n\nBerkshire still owned about 400 million shares worth $84.2 billion as of June 30.\n\nIn a note on Saturday Wedbush noted that Berkshire has sold Apple stock over the past year and in 1Q sold more than 10% of its stake \"so it's not a shock that the sales continued in 2Q although the magnitude is the headline grabber.\"\n\nWedbush noted that Berkshire still has Apple as its number one position and is more than double its next largest position in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) at roughly $41 billion.\n\n\"While the bears will clearly run with this news and narrative coming off a brutal Friday sell-off in tech stocks, we strongly caution that Buffett is a core believer in Apple and we do not view this as a smoke signal for bad news ahead (and its still the #1 Berkshire position by a wide margin),\" the note said.\n\n\"Apple just delivered a 9.7/10 June quarter in our view with strong September guidance into an AI driven iPhone 16 super cycle and that bull thesis is firmer today than before earnings.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBuffett a 'core believer' in Apple - Wedbush\n\nThis is the mother of all risks, Piper Sandler warns\n\n10 learnings from this earnings season\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Upgrade for PayPal; downgrades for Etsy, Lululemon",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nArm Holdings - Monday\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, HSBC downgraded Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to Reduce with a $105 price target.\n\nTLDR: HSBC cautious on AI PC narrative. Earnings may see pressure via smartphone weakness. 10% Free-Float liquidity level may present share price downside protection.\n\nWhat’s the full story? HSBC cut its FY25/FY26 EPS forecasts by 3% and 2%, respectively, due to a lack of smartphone restocking momentum and a weaker AI PC CPU narrative. The research team finds it difficult to justify a further re-rating beyond the new target price of $105.\n\nThey have rolled forward their valuation to FY26e, applying a lower target PE multiple of 51x (down from 63x) to the FY26e EPS of $2.06. This target price implies a 29.5% downside, leading to a downgrade of the stock from Hold to Reduce. However, the research team also acknowledges potential share price downside protection given the limited liquidity of only a 10% free float.\n\nLastly, the bank noted the AI PC narrative is not as bullish as previously expected despite higher royalties, and smartphone uncertainty poses a potential short-term risk to earnings.\n\nReduce at HSBC means “When the target price is more than 20% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Buy; when it is between 5% and 20% above the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Buy or a Hold; when it is between 5% below and 5% above the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Hold; when it is between 5% and 20% below the current share price, the stock may be classified as a Hold or a Reduce; and when it is more than 20% below the current share price, the stock will be classified as a Reduce.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Arm Holdings opened the regular session at $146.58 and closed at $141.48, a decline of 4.84% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nAffirm Holdings - Tuesday\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, BofA upgraded Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) to Buy with a $36 price target.\n\nTLDR: Management fiscal goals are achievable. Partnership expansion and credit-risk management are going well.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Bernstein SocGen has upgraded Affirm citing that GAAP profitability may be closer than consensus expectations. The research team maintains their estimates and price objective, noting that the fourth-quarter print and guide could serve as a positive catalyst. They also believe that fiscal 2025 forecasts are achievable. Additionally, a lower interest rate regime is expected to support revenue less transaction costs (RLTC), which is considered the most crucial P&L metric.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analysts are optimistic about new and expanded partnerships, particularly with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and highlight that credit risk remains well-controlled. This bullish outlook is underpinned by the belief that these factors collectively position Affirm Holdings for a promising financial trajectory.\n\nBuy at BofA means “Buy stocks are expected to have a total return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Affirm opened the regular session at $28.38 and closed at $27.45, a gain of 2.31% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nPayPal - Wednesday\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Bernstein SocGen upgraded PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to Outperform with a $64 price target.\n\nTLDR: Bernstein’s first PayPal upgrade in 3 years. Valuation is attractive and management has been executing.\n\nWhat’s the full story? The research team at Bernstein SocGen is making a tactical upgrade on PayPal to “Outperform” status, marking the first such upgrade in nearly three years. Their decision is based on several positive factors.\n\nFirstly, PayPal has demonstrated improved transaction gross profit performance, driven by growth in its branded services, pricing initiatives by Braintree, and successful monetization of Venmo.\n\nSecondly, the company’s product momentum and overall execution, under the new management team, are expected to sustain gross profit growth at a moderate single-digit level, even amidst competitive pressures.\n\nAdditionally, PayPal’s strategic optionality in the ecommerce and digital commerce space, along with its attractive valuation (trading at 14x 2025 price-to-earnings ratio), positions it as an appealing investment opportunity.\n\nOutperform at Bernstein SocGen means “Stock will trail the performance of the relevant index by more than 10 pp.”\n\nHow did the stock react? PayPal opened the regular session at $64.96 and closed at $65.87, a gain of 3% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nEtsy - Thursday\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Oppenheimer downgraded Etsy Inc (NASDAQ:ETSY) to Perform with no price target.\n\nTLDR: Recent strength/outperform limits valuation upside. Investment into cost-saving initiatives may dampen near-term financials.\n\nWhat’s the full story? The downgrade comes on the heels of recent strength. Despite Etsy reporting second-quarter results ahead of guidance due to a higher take-rate, weaker third-quarter guidance and the removal of the full-year Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) outlook indicate a lack of near-term visibility. Additionally, initiatives around gifting, seller classification, and a focus on the mobile app are not expected to impact fiscal year 2024 results.\n\nIn the long term, Oppenheimer sees potential for Etsy to leverage large language models to enhance search and discovery, though this will require significant time and investment, potentially conflicting with margin focus. While Etsy may eventually benefit from a cyclical recovery in its key categories, this is beyond management’s control.\n\nThe brokerage views Etsy as fully valued at 10x its fiscal year 2025 estimated EBITDA, compared to peers at 11x, noting that Etsy is growing 76% slower.\n\nPerform at Oppenheimer means “Stock expected to perform in line with the S&P 500 within the next 12-18 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Etsy opened the regular session at $63.03 and closed at $60.13, a decline of 7.86% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nLululemon - Friday\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) to Neutral with a $286 price target.\n\nTLDR: Goldman is negative on weaker execution and innovation. LULU brand to see further competitive pressure.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Goldman had previously maintained a positive outlook on Lululemon (LULU) despite a slowdown in US sales growth and visible execution missteps in the spring. The analysts believed that the company could drive a sequential reacceleration in the second half of the year through an improved assortment of colors, accessories, and sizes, as well as a strengthening innovation pipeline, including new fabric launches in women’s leggings. Despite some weaknesses observed in quarterly checks earlier in the month, the analysts had initially believed that trends were stable enough to maintain a constructive view on the stock.\n\nHowever, due to weaker execution and innovation, Goldman now has fading confidence in the near-term growth prospects for the brand in the US market. The analysts have observed limited signs of material innovation over the summer and were disappointed by the quick removal of the new Breeze through franchise, suggesting choppy near-term execution.\n\nAdditionally, LULU has become more promotional, raising concerns that the brand is training customers to expect regular discounts. Other signs of execution missteps were evident in store checks, and more cautious brand indicators were seen in proprietary HundredX survey data.\n\nGoldman no longer expects a second-half inflection in sales growth and believes the brand is more susceptible to competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors.\n\nNeutral at Goldman means “Goldman Sachs assigns stocks as Buys and Sells on various regional Investment Lists; stocks not so assigned are deemed Neutral.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Lululemon opened the regular session at $239.57 and closed at $236.00, a decline of 5.24% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Upgrade for PayPal; downgrades for Etsy, Lululemon\n\nHedge funds grow bearish amid economic slowdown jitters, Goldman says\n\nDelay to Nvidia's new AI chip could affect Microsoft, Google, Meta, the Information says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) was aggressively cutting his exposure to equities in the second quarter, new filings showed.\n\nThe company's financial statements indicated that a net amount of $75.5 billion worth of stocks were sold in the three months through June.\n\nBuffett was seen selling nearly half of its stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the second quarter, a move which contributed to an increase in Berkshire's cash reserves to $276.94 billion.\n\nHis Berkshire reported operating earnings for the second quarter of $11.6 billion.\n\nThe recent sales include Berkshire's systematic reduction of its investment in Bank of America, previously the firm's second-largest stock holding after Apple. Berkshire cut its stake in the bank to 12.15%, which was valued at over $35 billion as of the market close on Friday.\n\nThis sell-off occurred after Bank of America shares experienced a 75% surge from a low in late October up to the point when Berkshire initiated the sale in July.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Buffett highlighted the difficulty in deploying the company's cash, emphasizing a preference for investments with minimal risk and high return potential.\n\nBerkshire's quarterly filing also revealed that after cutting its Apple investment by 13% in the first quarter, the company proceeded to sell about 49% of its remaining Apple stock in the second quarter.\n\nThe news that Buffett sold $75.5 billion worth of shares in Q2 comes at a delicate time for the U.S. stock market, which experienced a massive selloff on Friday after a softer-than-expected jobs report.\n\nConcerns are mounting among investors as economic indicators suggested a more rapid deceleration of the U.S. economy than previously anticipated. Following the latest set of economic data, traders are increasingly viewing bad news as actually bad news.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is now in a challenging position. Several major Wall Street banks, including Citi and JPMorgan, are now calling for the Fed to implement bps rate cuts at upcoming meetings in September and November.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWarning: Warren Buffet is selling stocks.

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), led by Warren Buffett, significantly cut its investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), selling almost half of its shares in the tech giant.\n\nAccording to its recent earnings filing, the value of Berkshire's holdings in Apple dropped to $84.2 billion by the end of the second quarter, indicating a sale of nearly 50% of its position in the company. Despite this gigantic sell-off, Apple stock remains the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett hinted during the Berkshire annual meeting in May that the sales were partially motivated by tax considerations. He suggested that reducing the Apple position could be advantageous for Berkshire shareholders should capital gains taxes increase in the future.\n\nApple stock had a robust second quarter, surging 23% and setting a new record, buoyed by investor enthusiasm over the company's focus on artificial intelligence. This surge in stock price followed a decline in the previous quarter amid concerns that Apple was lagging in AI innovation.\n\nAt one point, Berkshire's investment in Apple represented half of its entire equity portfolio.\n\nIn addition to Apple, Buffett has been actively trimming positions in other major holdings.\n\nNotably, he has also begun to cut its stake in Berkshire's second-largest investment, Bank of America.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire sold nearly half of its Apple stake\n\nAbrdn finance chief Jason Windsor to replace Stephen Bird as CEO, Financial Times reports\n\nEarnings call: FCR reports solid Q2 with record rental rates and growth\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have seen enviable returns of 352% over the past five years",
        "content": "We think all investors should try to buy and hold high quality multi-year winners. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. For example, the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) share price is up a whopping 338% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. On top of that, the share price is up 20% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nOver half a decade, Apple managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 34% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Apple has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Apple, it has a TSR of 352% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Apple shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 35% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Apple that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of companies we expect will grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Apple Just Exposed a Massive Risk for Nvidia Stock",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) nearly $3 trillion valuation hinges on a critical assumption: The company's utter dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market is sustainable. Nvidia's market share has been estimated as high as 95%, and while competitors including AMD and Intel offer AI chips of their own, they've made little headway against the Nvidia juggernaut.\n\nHere's the problem: That assumption is probably not going to hold up in the long run. Nvidia has some important advantages, including a mature software ecosystem and best-in-class hardware, but cracks are starting to form. The biggest crack so far is Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) decision to avoid Nvidia's GPUs entirely while training its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence platform.\n\nNo Nvidia, no problem\n\nApple is late to the generative AI party, but it's now full steam ahead bringing AI features to its iPhones, Macs, and other devices. Apple Intelligence, which will go into beta later this year, includes AI-powered writing tools, image creation capabilities, a version of Siri that isn't embarrassing, and other useful features. None of this is groundbreaking, but these features will be deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem and available to the company's massive user base.\n\nApple has trained multiple AI models, including powerful server-based models that will run in the cloud and more compact models that will run directly on Apple devices. Training an AI model is computationally intensive, and Nvidia's GPUs have been the standard choice since the AI boom began. Apple notably took a different route.\n\nApple detailed the AI models that power Apple Intelligence in a recent research paper, and the big surprise is that the tech giant shunned Nvidia's GPUs entirely. The server-based models were trained on 8,192 TPUv4 AI chips from Alphabet's Google, while the on-device models were trained on a smaller number of TPUv5 AI chips.\n\nGoogle has been designing custom AI chips for years. The company's sixth-generation TPU, called Trillium, was announced in May. Google uses its custom chips to train its own AI models, and now Apple has chosen to do the same.\n\nApple's decision kills the argument that Nvidia's GPUs are the only game in town for AI training.\n\nA huge risk to Nvidia's profits\n\nThe AI chip market could grow fast enough for Nvidia's revenue to continue to rise at a healthy pace even if it loses market share. However, it's hard to imagine that Nvidia will be able to maintain its sky-high profit margins as competition chips away at its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia reported a net income of $14.9 billion on $26 billion in revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, ended April 28. It is highly unlikely that Nvidia will be able to maintain a net income margin above 50% in the long run. Competition will inevitably bring the company's profitability back down to earth.\n\nAI inference, the act of using trained AI models, doesn't necessarily require powerful GPUs at all. Intel's latest Xeon server CPUs, for example, can run some inference workloads, and PCs with dedicated AI chips are set to become the norm. AI training does require powerful accelerators, but Apple's choice to avoid Nvidia's GPUs is a strong sign that Nvidia's dominance of the AI training market is coming to an end.\n\nNvidia's AI growth story has been incredible, but Apple just delivered a serious blow to the AI king.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple's (AAPL) stock closed out the trading day Friday on a slightly positive note despite posting a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in its third quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\nWall Street was closely watching Apple's performance in China, one of its most important markets. The company has fought to regain market share from homegrown rivals including Huawei, but fell short of expectations in the region.\n\nApple saw revenue out of Greater China top out at $14.7 billion. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were anticipating revenue of $15.2 billion. Apple reported China revenue of $15.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall iPhone sales hit $39.2 billion versus expectations of $38.9 billion, falling short of the $39.6 billion Apple saw in Q3 2023.\n\nDespite the miss, Apple CFO Luca Maestri told Yahoo Finance's Josh Lipton that the company's sales are generally improving in the region. What's more, Maestri said Apple is seeing record upgrades in the country and that sales were better than in the first half of the year.\n\nFor the quarter Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $1.40 on revenue of $85.5 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $1.35 and revenue of $84.4 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Apple saw EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $81.7 billion in the same period last year.\n\nShares of Apple are up some 18.6% year to date despite a difficult start to the year, thanks, in part, to the impact of the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference in May, where it showed off its Apple Intelligence software. Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers remarks at the start of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nServices revenue hit $24.2 billion. Wall Street was anticipating revenue in the segment of $23.9 billion. Apple's iPad sales topped $7.1 billion compared to the $6.6 billion analysts were anticipating, on the strength of the company's new iPad Pro line.\n\nMac revenue reached $7 billion, climbing above the $6.8 billion the segment saw last year. Wearables sales, however, declined to $8 billion from the $8.2 billion Apple reported last year.\n\nApple is also preparing to launch its highly anticipated Apple Intelligence software later this fall. The software, which is powered by Apple’s generative AI technology, is set to hit iPhones, iPads, and Macs sometime in October, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nAnalysts are torn on the potential impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales in the year ahead, with some saying the software will kick off a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and others laying out more bearish expectations for the technology’s effect on Apple’s bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nImportantly, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones, which all but guarantees that any users desperate to get their hands on the technology will have upgrade to a new, more powerful phone as soon as it’s available.\n\nEither way, if Apple is going to turn Apple Intelligence into a hit, it’s going to need to ensure it has the capabilities that get customers excited to dive into the offering.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The violent rotation from Big Tech plunged the Nasdaq 100 Index into correction territory, wiping out more than $2 trillion in value in just over three weeks, as traders unwound bets that had been minting money for over a year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon’s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\n\nThe index closed down 2.4% on Friday, taking its loss since a July 10 record to more than 10%, passing the threshold that meets the definition of correction. The index closed at its lowest since mid-May on Friday, but remains up nearly 10% for the year.\n\nSubscribe to the Bloomberg Surveillance podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\n\nSeveral megacaps have seen concentrated selling, with both Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. down more than 20% from recent highs, putting them in bear-market territory. Meanwhile Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have each lost more than 10%. However, with the exception of Tesla, major big tech stocks remain higher for the year.\n\n“This is an amazing about-face, like we’ve crashed into a brick wall,” said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Co. “We had a heck of a straight line up, and those don’t last forever, especially since expectations got so high. You clearly can’t just own tech; you need some exposure to the more defensive areas.”\n\nAmazon and Intel Corp. were among the biggest decliners. Amazon fell 8.8% on Friday on heavy AI spending plans, while Intel plummeted 26% on a grim forecast, its biggest one-day percentage drop since at least 1982, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRed flags have been waving for the better part of the year, whether it is that tech stocks are too expensive, AI-fueled gains are overdone, or the market is too concentrated. With some high-profile earnings disappointments cementing those views, investors are now heeding those warnings, pocketing gains and plowing into previous laggards, like utilities, which have been leading the market over the past two sessions Treasury yields tumbling as traders bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates at its next meeting in September.\n\nThe Cboe NDX Volatility Index, which measures the 30-day implied swings in the Nasdaq 100 Index, briefly spiked above 28, its highest since March 2023. Volatility indexes for Apple and Amazon have also jumped of late. And the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is also at its highest in more than a year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rotation away from tech began in earnest after reading on June prices showed cooling inflation, stoking bets the Fed is ready to cut rates. The initial beneficiary was small-capitalization stocks, with the Russell 2000 rising nearly 4% since early July, compared with the Nasdaq 100’s steady decline.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech companies accounted for much of the S&P 500’s first-half advance, with the cap-weighted index beating its equal-weight cousin by the most since 1999. Valuations soared, with the S&P 500’s information technology index seeing its highest price-to-earnings ratio since 2002.\n\nThe tech rout picked up steam after Alphabet Inc. unveiled capital expenses that topped estimates by $1 billion in its July 23 earnings report, owing mostly to outlays for artificial intelligence. That was enough for investors, who have grown wary of seeing unbridled spending with only distant prospects for higher revenue, to head for the exit. Microsoft joined Alphabet and Amazon with a signal of heavy spending on AI.\n\n“I don’t think they’d be doing this kind of spending if demand wasn’t there, which bodes well for the long-term AI story,” said Stone, who said he had been adding to his Microsoft position amid the selloff. “However, there are all kinds of questions about the timing of AI demand, AI spending, and this kind of selling are the bumps in the road that come with that kind of thing.”\n\nThere have been some bright spots. Apple Inc. rose 0.7% on Friday, following a positive earnings report, and Meta Platforms Inc. rose earlier this week on its own results.\n\nRead this next: AI-Made Bioweapons Are Washington’s Latest Security Obsession\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\n(Updates with market close.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA The Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Long-Haul Warren Buffett Stocks That Every Investor Should Consider",
        "content": "At age 93, Warren Buffett presides over a vast stock portfolio currently worth nearly $400 billion. From humble beginnings, Buffett has created an equity portfolio that is the envy of the investment world. It is carefully tracked, meticulously analyzed and hotly debated by analysts, investors and media pundits. Many people try to replicate the Oracle of Omaha’s returns, though with decidedly mixed results.\n\nThrough his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), Buffett has developed an investing style focused on security analysis, sound fundamentals and risk avoidance. He owns primarily blue-chip stocks and takes a long-term buy-and-hold approach. Buffett has owned the same position in some stocks for more than 30 years. His patience, focus and wisdom have become truly legendary.\n\nHere are three Warren Buffett long-term stocks that every investor should consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat’s interesting about Berkshire Hathaway’s stock portfolio is how concentrated it is. Nearly half of the portfolio (45%) is invested in one stock: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Buffett owns nearly 790 million shares of AAPL stock, currently worth $177 billion. He owned more before trimming his stake in Apple stock during this year’s first quarter, as evidence pointed to a slowdown in sales of the signature iPhone. Apple is also one of Buffett’s newer holdings, having first started to acquire the stock in 2016.\n\nBuffett has been effusive in his praise of Apple, its products and the company’s CEO, Tim Cook. He has to be happy to see the consumer electronics giant get back on track after stumbling at the start of this year. In June, Apple unveiled its highly anticipated artificial intelligence strategy. And on Aug. 1, the company reported financial results for this year’s second quarter that beat Wall Street forecasts, with iPhone sales exceeding expectations. Apple stock is up 17% so far this year.\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuffett has owned shares of credit rating agency Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) since the year 2000. Berkshire Hathaway today holds 24.6 million shares of MCO stock worth $11.27 billion. Berkshire’s position has barely changed over nearly 25 years. Buffett clearly likes Moody’s business and competitive position in the marketplace. The company is one of only three credit rating agencies in the U.S., along with Standard & Poor’s (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch Ratings.\n\nCurrently, Moody’s comprises 2.9% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio, making it one of the larger holdings that’s not Apple. Buffett has steadfastly held onto MCO stock through many market downturns and despite the ratings agencies coming under heavy criticism during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Despite some ups and downs, Moody’s has continued to be a strong business. The company recently reported second-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts, with revenue up 22% and profits up 46% from a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nMCO stock is up nearly 20% on the year.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger storefront and logo\n\nRetail grocery store chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) is the type of blue-chip stock Buffett covets. The essential nature of the groceries it sells insulates Kroger from economic downturns. The stock has proven to be a steady gainer, having risen 151% in the last five years. The shares also trade at a reasonable valuation of 12 times future earnings estimates, meaning it’s not too expensive to own. And, KR stock pays a strong quarterly dividend of 32 cents a share, giving it a yield of 2.32%.\n\nBuffett owns exactly 50 million shares of KR stock worth $2.72 billion based on the current price. The position is relatively small, comprising just 0.7% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. But it’s larger than many positions Buffett holds. KR stock has been on an upswing lately. Since the end of June, the company’s share price has increased 10%. The stock has been marching higher since Kroger announced that it is pausing its $25 billion merger with grocery rival Albertsons (NYSE:ACI).\n\nYear to date, KR stock is up 21%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple's Multi-Year iPhone Upgrade Cycle and AI Features To Drive Upside, Analysts Say\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall maintained Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy and raised the price target from $265 to $275.\n\nThe analyst said Apple should be on the cusp of a multi-year replacement cycle for the iPhone after the iPhone maker delivered a solid third-quarter iPhone-driven EPS beat with continued services momentum.\n\nThe analyst noted that iPhone revenue of $39.3 billion beat the consensus of $38.6 billion, growing ~2% ex-forex (-1% year-on-year). Apple ended the quarter with channel inventory at the low end of its target range for iPhone and iPad, Hall highlighted.\n\nAlso, iPad and Mac revenue beat consensus revenue, reflecting new product launch benefits, with the latest iPads and Mac in the quarter all capable of supporting Apple Intelligence.\n\nHall highlighted Apple’s fourth-quarter revenue guidance for 5% Y/Y, including service revenue growth of 13% Y/Y, which implies 2% Y/Y product revenue growth.\n\nApple’s reminders about tough comparisons on Mac (Y/Y comps), Wearables (Y/Y comps), and iPad (Q/Q comps) imply that iPhone revenue should grow Y/Y in the fourth quarter, indicating strong demand, as per the analyst.\n\nHe said that Apple’s fourth-quarter gross margin guidance of 45.5%-46.5% (versus consensus of 45.7%) would mark a fourth-quarter record, even at the low end.\n\nThe fourth-quarter gross margin outlook supports the analyst’s view that iPhone revenue in the September quarter should be substantial given that the iPhone has the highest margins in the products portfolio, providing mix benefits and that the recent services gross margin expansion to the mid-70% range is durable.\n\nHall projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.54 billion and $1.60.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel reiterated a Sector Weight rating on Apple.\n\nThe re-rating reflected the third-quarter results that came in better than expectations, but guidance aligned with expectations.\n\nNispel said Apple outperformed expectations across all product categories, ex Mac, and beat on services.\n\nWhile the guide is cryptic, he noted it implies iPhone +~3% Y/Y.\n\nBased on his conversations with carriers, Nispel remained skeptical of a significant acceleration in the upgrade cycle and noted a much more gradual replacement rate than the bulls.\n\nNispel’s model continues to call for less growth than consensus, and he continues to see upgrade rate pressures and China competition, which limits his enthusiasm for Apple.\n\nNispel projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.10 billion and $1.58.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Matt Farrell reiterated a Neutral rating on Apple with a $225 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple delivered June quarter results slightly ahead of expectations, mainly due to strong growth in iPad and services, Farrell noted.\n\nThe analyst flagged that iPhone revenue was down 1% Y/Y in the June quarter despite the install base hitting new all-time highs.\n\nIn addition, Greater China’s revenue showed further improvement in the June quarter. Farrell said investors remain laser-focused on the second half of the iPhone ramp.\n\nStill, based on the September quarter commentary, the analyst’s iPhone revenue estimates remain unchanged for the back half of the calendar year. Management is very excited about the Apple Intelligence opportunity.\n\nHowever, it will roll out in stages across the globe, and Farrell is still cautious about the consumer entering the second half. The analyst continues to view shares as appropriately valued ahead of the upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\n\nFarrell projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.07 billion and $1.58.\n\nBofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained a Buy rating on Apple with a price target of $256.\n\nThe re-rating reflected the expected strong iPhone upgrade cycle in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, higher growth in services revenue, higher margins from more internally developed silicon, continuing capital returns, and AI features that can drive higher institutional ownership.\n\nAccording to Mohan, results from Apple indicate improving trends across the portfolio where growth accelerated in iPhone, iPad, and wearables and across regions.\n\nAs per the analyst, implied revenue guidance of $94 billion will be conservative, especially around services and iPhones. Mohan noted the potential for significant acceleration of units in the December quarter and overall in fiscal 2025 with the rollout of Apple Intelligence.\n\nMohan said there is potential for consensus estimates to be revised higher given the multi-year iPhone upgrade cycle, tailwinds to gross margins, and strong cash flows.\n\nMohan projected fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $94.75 billion and $1.61.\n\nPrice Action: AAPL is up 3.08% at $225.08 at the last check on Friday.\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for AAPL\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Equal-Weight Feb 2022 Tigress Financial Maintains Strong Buy Jan 2022 Credit Suisse Maintains Neutral\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for AAPL\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple's Multi-Year iPhone Upgrade Cycle and AI Features To Drive Upside, Analysts Say originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Apple recently released its Q3 earnings report, beating expectations and showing why it's still a top player in tech. Even though Steve Jobs passed away in 2011, his name will always be synonymous with Apple. During a 2012 interview on CNBC's Squawk Box, Warren Buffett shared a memorable phone call he had with Jobs about Apple's cash reserves a couple of years prior.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens. Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\n\"It was an interesting conversation because I hadn't talked to him in a long time,\" Buffett said. Jobs had called to get advice on what to do with Apple's massive cash pile. \"He said, ‘We've got all this cash. What should we do with it?' So we went over the options.\"\n\nBuffett told Becky Quick that companies usually have four choices for using cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions, or holding onto it. Jobs made it clear that Apple wouldn't go for big acquisitions needing a lot of cash.\n\n\"I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,\" Buffett recalled. When Buffett suggested stock buybacks if Apple thought its stock was undervalued, Jobs replied, \"I think my stock is very undervalued.\"\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nDespite this, Jobs chose not to follow Buffett's advice. \"He didn't do anything, and of course, he didn't want to do anything. He just liked having the cash,\" Buffett noted with a laugh. \"It was very interesting to me because I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash.\"\n\nBuffett admitted he wished he had bought Apple's stock back then. Once hesitant about tech investments, he has become a major shareholder in Apple through Berkshire Hathaway. His investment in Apple is now one of Berkshire's largest, showing his confidence in the company's future.\n\nTrending: America's construction sites are desperate for Robots — here’s how to invest in a house-printing startup who’s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\n\nOver the years, he has repeatedly sung praise for Apple and Tim Cook. During a 2020 Squawk Box interview, Buffett explained how valuable Apple is to Berkshire, saying, \"I don't think of Apple as a stock. I think of it as our third business.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a 2023 conversation with CNBC, Warren Buffett expressed his admiration for Tim Cook’s leadership at Apple. He described Cook as “one of the classiest CEOs” and emphasized his deep understanding of the business. Buffett remarked, \"Tim Cook has managed that company in an extraordinary way.\"\n\nHighlighting the strong connection between the Apple brand and its loyal customers, Buffett illustrated this loyalty with an example: \"If you're an Apple user and someone offers you $10,000, but the only condition is that they'll take away your iPhone and you'll never be able to buy another, you're not going to take it.\"\n\nSee Also: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nUnder Cook’s leadership, Apple has taken a more balanced approach to managing its cash reserves. Unlike Jobs, who preferred to hold onto cash, Cook has implemented a strategy that includes stock buybacks, dividend payments, and increased investment in research and development.\n\nIn May, Reuters reported Apple increased its cash dividend by 4% and also authorized an additional program to buy back $110 billion of stock, making it the largest buyback in the company’s history.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDon’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.

        "content": "Revenge Of The Rest: These Three S&P 493 Stocks Are Set To Pop\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nU.S. equities have been dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven,\" accounting for the majority of the gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index. The highly esteemed group comprises seven of the largest companies in the U.S.: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThese tech titans make up about a third of the index’s total value, overshadowing the performance of the other 493 companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has gained over 37% year-to-date, overshadowing the broader index's 15.8% returns over this period.\n\nCheck It Out: When today’s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them — here’s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding the potential overvaluation of the tech heavyweights have been racking investors, causing the S&P 500 index to decline by nearly 30 basis points over the past month.\n\nNonetheless, analysts are bullish on the remaining 493 stocks in the index.\n\n“So we’re seeing a diverging trend between the Magnificent Seven and the [S&P] 493 happening this quarter. The other 493 were basically in an earnings recession up until last quarter. We expect this earnings season is going to be the first quarter for the other 493 to post positive earnings growth since Q4 of ’22, whereas the Mag 7, their earnings growth is expected to decelerate for the second straight quarter and again in Q3. And by Q4 of this year consensus points to basically similar growth rates between the two and I think that will really be the catalyst for the rotation in the market to take place,” said Ohsung Kwon, U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America Securities.\n\nAmong the S&P 493, several dividend stocks stand out as potential winners in this expected market rotation.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, has been steadily investing in its 5G network. The company added 391,000 total broadband connections in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, marking the eighth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 broadband additions. Verizon's total broadband subscribers stood at 11.5 million as of the end of the second quarter, reflecting a 17.2% rise from the same period last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon pays $2.66 in dividends annually, yielding 6.64% on the current price. The company is currently on track to becoming a dividend aristocrat, as it has raised its dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years as of 2023.\n\n\"Our consistently disciplined approach to driving strong cash flow, operating the business, and serving our customers has once again put the Board in a position to raise the dividend,\" Verizon's Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg said in a news release, \"We continue to deliver value to our shareholders as we execute our network-as-a-service strategy.\"\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation’s 1%.

Don’t miss out on the opportunity to understand the art market dynamics.\n\nWalgreens\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), a leading pharmacy chain, had been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat until earlier this year when it slashed its quarterly dividend payouts by 48% to 25 cents per share. The company currently pays $1 per share in dividends annually, yielding 8.22% on the current price.\n\nBefore the dividend cut in January 2024, Walgreens was on track to becoming a Dividend King, having raised its dividends for 47 consecutive years.\n\nHowever, the company has been focusing on bolstering its growth prospects by expanding its health care services, including partnerships with primary care providers and investments in digital health initiatives.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to reduce our quarterly dividend payment to 25 cents per share, to strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position. This action reinforces our goal of increasing cash flow while freeing up capital to invest in sustainable growth initiatives in our pharmacy and health care businesses, which we believe will ultimately improve shareholder value,\" said Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, in a news release.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a global pharmaceutical giant, has been at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 with its vaccine development. As of December 2023, Pfizer currently pays $1.68 in dividends annually, yielding 5.35% on the current price. The company has increased its dividend for 15 years in a row.\n\nHowever, as COVID-19-related growth subsides, Pfizer's earnings have been declining. The company's net income amounted to $2.33 billion, or 41 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2024, marking a 98% decline year-over-year. This comes as the pandemic-driven momentum wanes, causing Pfizer's profit margins to dwindle.\n\nNonetheless, analysts expect the company's earnings to rise in the near term at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% per annum over the next five years.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "title": "Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip",
        "content": "When it comes to the Magnificent Seven and big tech stocks, one of the ones I like the least is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as I find its business model less appealing and a little more fragile when compared to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nEven so, it is undeniable that the Google parent company has its moats and an excellent operational track record.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nAs the company is far from bad, I believe this recent dip makes the stock even more attractive, which, if it maintains its prospects of growing by double digits a year, is very cheap.\n\nIs the business model threatened?\n\nLooking at the forward price-earnings of the main Magnificent Seven companies, it is clear Alphabet stands out as the one with the lowest indicator. While the search machine is trading at 21 times its next 12 months' earnings, companies like Microsoft and Apple are already over 30, not to mention Amazon and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which add further distortion to this comparison. Even Meta (NASDAQ:META), which in recent history had the lowest multiples, has overtaken the tech giant.\n\nNote that although Alphabet has never stood out as a company that is traded with a rich multiple, in many periods it was much closer to the other companies, and only in recent months has this gap opened up. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nGOOGL Data by GuruFocus\n\nOf course, there is a reason for this. Even though the market often acts in a dysfunctional way, this would hardly happen without a plausible justification, especially for one of the world's largest companies. The main reason for the stock trading at this level, while maintaining an expectation of double-digit sales growth, is the threat to its main business, Google Search.\n\nIn the second quarter, the search tool accounted for 57% of the group's revenue, while other initiatives such as YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud were closer to 10% each. Even with this dependence, credit must be given to Alphabet, which over the years has built up a complete and diversified business model. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: App Economy Insights\n\nAccording to some bears, Google's search model could be disrupted or slowed down by large language models. Today, the most common thing when you want to go to a restaurant or have a question is to go to the search engine and type it in. One of the narratives suggests this could easily be replaced by a question to your chatbot, be it GPT Chat, Alexa or Siri. If, instead of searching, many people start using these other methods, search becomes less relevant and directly impacts the company's revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nMy take tends toward skepticism. However long it takes for this narrative to materialize, instead of completely disrupting Google Search, it may only be something that will add obstacles, reducing growth rather than bringing about a stagnation or decrease in this line of revenue in the short and medium term. Artificial intelliegence will gradually become more popular, but to reach a considerable mass of the population that adopts it in their daily lives and replaces their habits of using Google search as a tool could take years.\n\nAs Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, even if this happens gradually, the company will be able to balance it with growth at other ends, whether in the cloud, through YouTube or a new line of revenue with Gemini. There is a range of options that bring an interesting vision and can help sustain this growth in the long run.\n\nStick with the fundamentals\n\nIn many cases, investors tend to turn something simple into something complex. While this can sometimes be necessary, especially in technology segments that are very dynamic and the outlook changes all the time, overcomplicating something and getting carried away with the narrative is a very common mistake.\n\nTrying to look at it pragmatically, in a stick with the fundamentals analysis, Alphabet is still an excellent company. In the breakdown of revenue, you can see that search revenue and Google Play advanced by 14% year over year, YouTube by 13% and Google Cloud by 29%. Alphabet is far from a dying business. Even with this growth, the miss in YouTube ad revenue disappointed the market, which together with the higher capital expenditures, caused the stock to fall post-earnings.\n\nBut it does not stop there. As well as having a growth rank of 10 on the GF Score, its profitability rank is also solid at 10. Its financial strength is also very good with cash on hand of over $100 billion. In terms of profitability, it is worth highlighting a net margin of 26.70% as well as a return on invested capital of 32.50%, which shows a cash cow business model and assertive capital allocation. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nHow about the future?\n\nAlphabet's capital allocation is very good as it has robust cash on hand, which could eventually turn into another successful acquisition like YouTube, or reinvestment in the business that is transformed to at least remain relevant in industries like search, AI and cloud. In the second quarter, the company made capital expenditures of more than $13 billion to cope with a robust infrastructure that supports the advancement of Google Cloud, Google Search and other businesses through data centers, but it put pressure on free cash flow.\n\nFurthermore, although there is a risk that search will be affected, this is not a trend that seems likely to occur in the medium term. As already mentioned, this depends on the mass replacement and adoption of a new tool by the population. In the short and medium term, this technological evolution could bring greater assertiveness to ads and searches, boosting this market as a positive trend.\n\nWhen it comes to competition, although Google has recently lost ground to Bing (Microsoft's search engine), Alphabet still has a virtual monopoly, with more than 80% of the search market according to Statista. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nSource: Statista\n\nIn this way, the future for search is partly cloudy, but it does not seem so uncertain that it can be labeled a dying business.\n\nEverything has a price\n\nIn addition to the multiples, which became even more attractive after the recent dip, other methods reinforce that Alphabet's stock is at a level that will remunerate shareholders well. If we run a reverse discounted cash flow model using earnings per share, projecting growth of 15% per year for the next 10 years and 10% for the following decade, we find the current share price by discounting at a rate of 12%. In other words, if the company manages to achieve greater growth than this, the annual return for the shareholder would be above 12%, making the stock a real compounder.\n\nThis becomes even more interesting when we look at the last five years, where the earnings per share compound annual growth rate has been 25.90%. Although the company does not need to maintain this level consistently, it is possible that positive surprises could happen along the way so that EPS growth could exceed the projected 10% to 15% per year. Alphabet's Value Shines After Dip\n\nIf we use more reasonable assumptions to try to find a fair price, it is still possible to find an interesting upside. With 18% in the first 10 years and 8% in the last 10, discounting by 11% (still a high and restrictive figure for a company of such quality), we would have a fair value of $212 per share, equivalent to an upside of 21%. I used EPS instead of free cash flow because of the recent history of high capex, which would negatively bias the reverse DCF model.\n\nAccording to the GF Value Line, the stock should be worth around $155, which currently qualifies it as fairly valued, showing that although Alphabet is much cheaper than its tech peers, it's still not a huge bargain.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAlphabet still has relevant moats and is not a dying business. For this reason, even though there is a certain cloudiness to some parts of its business model, the discrepancy between the premium for companies like Apple and Microsoft seems to have become very large, while there is a discount on the Google parent's shares that makes it more attractive, especially after this dip.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "These 5 Dividend Stocks Account for 74% of Warren Buffett's $399 Billion Portfolio",
        "content": "Warren Buffett loves dividend stocks. The top holdings in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio all pay dividends, but that's just one common theme among those blue chip stocks. They're also big names within their respective industries, and they are solid investments that any investor can justify putting in a portfolio and hanging on to for years.\n\nThe top five holds in Berkshire's portfolio are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Collectively, they account for about three-quarters of all of Berkshire's holdings. Here's how much they make up individually, their dividend yields, and what makes these stocks exceptional long-term investments.\n\nApple: 43.1%\n\nThe iPhone and iPad maker Apple needs no introduction. It's routinely one of the top stocks in the world in terms of market cap, and its position atop the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio remains fixed. It would be a seismic development for Berkshire to drastically reduce its holdings of Apple.\n\nBuffett has long been fond of Apple, once saying that it is \"probably the best business I know in the world.\"\n\nApple's dividend yields a modest 0.5%, but it has also increased that dividend over the years. And with Apple continuously generating incredibly large sums of free cash flow every year, there's little doubt that the dividend will continue to rise over time. In its most recent fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023, Apple reported free cash flow of just under $100 billion, and it spent just $15 billion on its dividend.\n\nFor buy-and-hold investors, it's hard to imagine a safer stock to own than Apple. While its growth rate has struggled lately, with the launch of phones that employ artificial intelligence capabilities, there could soon be another big growth catalyst coming for the business.\n\nBank of America: 10.1%\n\nBerkshire has recently been selling off some shares of Bank of America, but it still remains one of the company's top holdings. As one of the top bank stocks in the U.S., Bank of America is an incredibly sound investment to hang on to today.\n\nWhile there will be volatility depending on the state of the economy, it's a great way to bet on America, which Buffett always advocates for. If the economy is doing well, Bank of America will be in a good position to generate strong numbers as well.\n\nIts numbers have been solid. In its most recent quarter, which ended in June, Bank of America generated $25.4 billion in revenue (net of interest expense), which rose by 1% year over year. It also marked the 22nd consecutive quarter where its consumer banking business grew, with the addition of approximately 278,000 new customer checking accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America stock pays a dividend yielding 2.5%, which is higher than the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. With the stock trading at just 1.2 times its book value, it also makes for an attractive value buy for long-term investors.\n\nAmerican Express: 9.4%\n\nCredit card issuer American Express is the third-largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, slightly trailing Bank of America. Buffett is a fan of credit card stocks, and American Express' strong numbers make it a solid investment to buy and hold.\n\nIn July, it reported another strong quarter of growth, prompting it to raise its guidance for earnings per share. Revenue of $16.3 billion was up 9% organically, and the company's adjusted earnings grew by 21% year over year.\n\nSimilar to Bank of America, American Express is another example of how investors can bet on the success of the U.S. by investing in the credit card issuer's stock. American Express pays a more modest yield of 1.1%, but between its attractive growth numbers and decent dividend, it can give you multiple ways to make money from this investment.\n\nCoca-Cola: 6.7%\n\nSoft drink giant Coca-Cola is another big brand among the top holdings in Berkshire's portfolio. There are few things more iconic for consumers than the Coca-Cola logo, which is a staple in households all over the world. While it may seem like Coca-Cola's business should have peaked years ago, the company has been expanding into water, coffee, and other beverage businesses in order to grow its sales and profits. Today, the company has over 200 different brands in its portfolio.\n\nThe company's vast distribution network puts it in a great position to grow whatever new business line it chooses to focus on. The strength of its business gives the company a significant advantage over competitors. Despite its already massive size, Coca-Cola has managed to grow its top line by 39% in three years to $45.8 billion. With strong profit margins of 23%, it reported $10.7 billion of that as net income last year.\n\nCoca-Cola is the only Dividend King on this list, having raised its payouts for more than 60 consecutive years. And with a yield which is already fairly high at 2.9%, this can be an ideal stock for dividend investors to hang on to for not just years, but decades.\n\nChevron: 4.8%\n\nRounding out the top five on Berkshire's list is oil and gas giant Chevron. Although there's a push for greener, electric vehicles in the world, there's still a strong need for the company's fuel, and that could remain the case for years to come. Investing in Chevron gives investors a great way to take advantage of a business that can benefit from inflation.\n\nAs oil prices have risen, Chevron has seen its revenue and profits take off. While there can be volatility in its earnings due to its exposure to commodity prices, adding Chevron to your portfolio can be a good way to hedge some risk and add some valuable diversification with a top oil and gas stock. In each of the past three years, the company has generated a profit of at least $15 billion, reaching as high as $35 billion in 2022, when crude oil prices topped more than $100 per barrel.\n\nChevron's 4.1%-yielding dividend is close to three times the S&P 500 average. If you're a dividend investor seeking diversification, it can make for an excellent stock to hold in your portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Practically everyone building an artificial intelligence (AI) large language model relies on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) for its high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Big tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and others have been committing billions of dollars to Nvidia just to get their hands on the next batch of chips.\n\nBut Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), true to its roots, thinks differently.\n\nThe company revealed its long-awaited AI features in early June. It's calling the system Apple Intelligence, which consists of multiple generative AI models fine-tuned for various tasks, such as writing, summarizing, image generation, and interacting with iPhone and Mac apps. But those models weren't trained using Nvidia GPUs. They weren't trained using GPUs at all. Nvidia HQ. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBuilding the Apple Foundation Model\n\nApple used Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train its Apple Foundation Models, which power Apple Intelligence. A TPU is a special type of computer chip called an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC. Unlike a GPU, an ASIC chip is relatively limited in what kind of processes it can run. But it runs those processes extremely efficiently.\n\nApple used the fourth and fifth generations of Google's TPUs to train its foundation models. Google says the TPU v5p, released late last year, is 2.8 times faster than the fourth-generation design. And Google's TPU v4 was between 1.2 times and 1.7 times faster than the Nvidia A100. Some back-of-the-envelope math then puts the v5p chips on par with Nvidia's latest H100 chips. In May, Google introduced its sixth-generation TPU, which produces even more speed improvements.\n\nIn other words, when it comes to training a foundation model for generative AI, Google's own designs appear to be just as good as Nvidia's latest hardware. More importantly, they're more energy- and cost-efficient than using a GPU. As a result, Apple can end up with a foundation model for Apple Intelligence at a fraction of the price it would've cost to use Nvidia's chips.\n\nApple certainly isn't the only company using Google TPUs for training its AI, but the fact that one of the wealthiest companies in the world decided to go with TPUs over Nvidia should send a major warning to Nvidia investors.\n\nGoogle isn't the only one making AI chips\n\nNvidia relies on a small group of tech giants for a large part of its business. Google is one of its biggest customers despite the fact that it's spent a decade designing its own AI chips. Likewise, Nvidia's other biggest customers -- Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta -- are all designing their own custom silicon for training and running AI models.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai may have summarized the biggest reason these companies continue to purchase every chip they can from Nvidia on his company's second-quarter earnings call. \"When we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us.\" In other words, the potential loss from not spending heavily on AI chips and data centers is far greater than the cost of spending.\n\nBut ultimately, Google TPUs and other custom silicon may prove a more cost-effective way to continue scaling the AI businesses of these tech giants. And Apple's decision to use TPUs is a major testament to that.\n\nCustomer concentration is a major risk for Nvidia. During Q1, two customers accounted for 24% of its total revenue. As these customers work to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, the chip designer could see its revenue growth slow significantly over the next few years.\n\nConsidering the expectations for Nvidia are high, that makes the potential for more AI developers to use cost-effective ASICs instead of Nvidia GPUs a serious threat to the stock price. One bad quarter could send shares considerably lower.\n\nEven after the pullback in price, Nvidia shares trade for over 42 times forward earnings and an enterprise value-to-revenue multiple of around 34. Both are extremely high for a company of its size, and while it's managed to beat expectations amid the ongoing AI boom, the potential for a slowdown in sales and profits keeps getting stronger. Nvidia's AI dominance won't last forever, but investors are acting like it will, based on its current share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock index futures fell abruptly Friday, continuing recent weakness following weak earnings from tech giants as well as concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nAt 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), Dow Jones Futures fell 380 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 Futures dropped 59 points, or 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 Futures slumped 295 points, or 1.6%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after a softer-than-expected ISM report on U.S. manufacturing caused investors to fret about a possible recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, the NASDAQ Composite fell 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped almost 500 points, or 1.2%.\n\nIntel, Amazon disappoint; Apple earnings beat estimates\n\nSentiment was also hit by poorly received earnings from tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which overshadowed positive numbers from iPhone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nChipmaker Intel stock slumped over 20% premarket as its June quarter earnings missed estimates. The company also suspended its dividend and said it will cut 15% of its jobs as part of a turnaround plan.\n\nAmazon stock fell more than 8% after the e-commerce giant provided a softer-than-expected outlook on revenue, and warned that online sales were slowing as consumers grew more cautious over purchases.\n\nApple stock traded largely unchanged after the company reported stronger-than-expected revenue and profit in the June quarter.\n\nThis came on the back of slightly better than expected sales of its flagship iPhone, although device sales did fall from last year amid growing competition in top market China.\n\nPayrolls data due\n\nA round of economic data has spurred fears of a faster-than-expected economic slowdown amid fears the U.S. Federal Reserve has maintained its restrictive monetary policy for too long.\n\nThe focus now turns to the July official jobs report, with investors looking for further signs that the U.S. labor market is easing.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nCrude on track for more weekly losses\n\nCrude prices rose Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight week of losses given mounting concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nBy 06:30 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.3% to $76.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $79.72 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks have declined around 8% over the last four weeks as disappointing economic data from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia, Europe and the United States raised concerns of weak global economic growth, weighing on oil consumption.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe weak economic prints saw markets largely look past heightened tensions in the Middle East after the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran earlier in the week.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, made no changes to its production policies after an online meeting on Thursday, reiterating that it could pause plans to increase output from October.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures sink after weak tech earnings; payrolls due\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet cut stake in Crowdstrike before July global outage\n\nLyondellBasell Q2 profit tops estimates, revenue rises as seasonal demand improves\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThere’s a spending frenzy around AI, and this earnings season we’ve been getting more details on the pace of that outlay.\n\nMeta raised its capital expenditures forecast to the range of $37 billion to $40 billion. Microsoft spent $19 billion last quarter, including server farm leases. Amazon spent $30 billion so far this year and says it’ll kick it up a notch to close out 2024. Apple may be zagging, but clearly has a fresh AI focus of its own.\n\nWe’ve been told that generative AI is the next smartphone, the next internet — a transformational technology. That’s why these companies have ramped up spending in a generative AI-building arms race.\n\nThey’re spending because they believe in it, of course.\n\nBut is the spending also influencing that belief? Are the stakes now so high that even if the promise of generative AI doesn’t meet those lofty expectations, these companies, and their clients, will try to shoehorn it into products and processes where it’s not really needed?\n\nHistory is littered with “transformational” technologies that didn’t quite make the grade.\n\nDigital assistants, for example, like Amazon’s Alexa. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a former senior employee as saying, “We worried we’ve hired 10,000 people and we’ve built a smart timer.” Apple was reportedly spending $1 billion annually to develop a supposedly industry-changing vehicle before abandoning that effort earlier this year.\n\nOf course, a moonshot effort like the car was a sideline to Apple’s main business and hardly a lottery ticket for the company. It seems more so for Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, even Tesla, which are putting AI front and center in their pitch to investors. They’re motivated to make it work.\n\nAnd make it work quickly. Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn called the infrastructure build a “cycle of competitive escalation” in a recent piece, positing that the hyperscalers would move much more slowly, and perhaps rationally, if not on each other’s heels.\n\nThe ensuing digestion period has already likely begun, if investors’ impatient reaction to Microsoft’s earnings is any indication. Meta, on the other hand, “continues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI,” wrote JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth in reaction to its numbers.\n\nAs he pointed out, “Management continues to expect Meta AI to become the most used AI assistant by the end of 2024, & open source Llama 3.1 should support a faster pace of innovation, better social/advertiser experiences, & cost benefits.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIs that transformational? Expect to continue to hear that it is, or will be. It has to — because they’re writing the checks.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "Apple Sees Boost From AI Features After Uneven Third Quarter",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. predicted that its new artificial intelligence features will spur iPhone upgrades in coming months, helping the company reemerge from a sales slowdown that has hit its China business especially hard.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Reporter to Be Freed by Russia in Major Prisoner Swap Kamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat While ‘Pod Save America’ Tries to Unite Democrats, Its Staff Rebels Ackman’s IPO Dream Implodes From $25 Billion to Zero in Weeks Stocks Sink Before Jobs as Tech Hit on Earnings: Markets Wrap\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook, speaking on a conference call Thursday to discuss third-quarter results, said that upcoming Apple Intelligence features will provide a fresh reason for customers to buy new phones.\n\n“It will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle,” he told analysts on the call.\n\nThe remarks followed generally upbeat third-quarter results that were marred by sluggish sales in China. Apple returned to revenue growth in the period, which ended June 29, with an increase of 5% to $85.8 billion. That beat the $84.5 billion analyst estimate.\n\nBut sales from China fell 6.5% to $14.7 billion, missing the $15.3 billion projection from Wall Street.\n\nThe shares bounced up and down in late trading following the earnings report. By 6:30 p.m. in New York, they were up more than 1%. The stock had gained 13% this year through the close, lifted by investors’ hope that new artificial intelligence technology would help boost sales.\n\nThe China results rekindled fears that Apple is losing ground in one of its most important overseas markets. The company is up against fiercer competition in the region, and the government has reined in the use of foreign technology in some workplaces. Chinese economic growth also has worsened.\n\nApple attributed much of the decline to the impact of a strong dollar, saying that the underlying business in China is actually healthier than before. Three months ago, executives said the slowdown was less about an underperforming iPhone and more about weak sales of other products.\n\n“We do realize it’s a very competitive smartphone market, but we feel we are doing quite well within the context of the broader economy,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang.\n\nCook said during the call that Apple still has faith in the market. “I don’t know how every chapter of the book reads, but we’re very confident in the long term,” he said.\n\nSeptember Quarter\n\nApple said that total sales in the September quarter will grow at a similar level as the just-ended period, implying an increase of about 5%. Wall Street has projected a 4% clip. Services will be a highlight in the period, advancing in the double digits, executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings amounted to $1.40 a share in third quarter, exceeding the $1.35 analysts had estimated. The period ending in June is typically one of Apple’s slowest, coming at a time when many customers are waiting for the next iPhone to arrive in the fall.\n\nSales of Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone, came in at $39.3 billion. Though the number was down slightly from a year earlier, it edged past Wall Street expectations. Three months ago, the company declined to forecast iPhone revenue for the June period — a signal it was still unsure about the shaky smartphone market.\n\niPad Comeback\n\nApple’s iPad business benefited from the long-awaited release of new models. The company introduced major upgrades in May after a sluggish stretch for the tablet lineup. The new products included a pricier iPad Pro with an M4 chip, as well as a faster version of the iPad Air with a bigger-screen option.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company reported $7.16 billion in revenue from the category, up 24%. That beat the estimate of $6.6 billion. Apple previously said it expected the iPad to grow by a percentage in the double digits during the June period — something it easily accomplished. For several months, some customers and schools had been holding out on iPad purchases in expectation of the new models.\n\n“About half the customers who purchased an iPad were new to the product,” Maestri said.\n\nBeyond the new iPad Pro and iPad Air, Apple is working on versions of its entry-level iPad and iPad mini with faster processors. That could spur additional upgrades when they are released sometime in the coming months.\n\nApple Intelligence\n\nThe company also unveiled Apple Intelligence last quarter, showing off the new AI tools at its developers conference in June. But the technology — headed for the iPhone, iPad and Mac — isn’t expected to be released to customers until October. Apple also hasn’t yet explained how it plans to generate revenue from the features, beyond spurring demand for compatible devices. And the technology won’t be available in China at the outset.\n\nThe services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Music and the TV+ streaming platform, continues to be a growth driver. It generated $24.2 billion in sales last quarter, up 14%.\n\nWall Street was looking for services revenue of just under $24 billion. Still, that business is under pressure from regulators who are seeking changes to the App Store, which they see as an anticompetitive force in the industry. That could ultimately limit Apple’s ability to collect revenue from subscriptions and app downloads.\n\nMac revenue rose 2.5% to $7.01 billion, helped by the start of the back-to-school shopping season. That was in line with Wall Street predictions.\n\nApple hasn’t made major changes to the Mac since the end of last year, but did add the M3 chip to the MacBook Air laptop in March. The computer line could be in for a boost later this year when Apple kicks off a shift to the more powerful M4 chip. The company is planning to update every Mac line with the new processor, which can better handle AI tasks, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories — a once high-flying category that includes AirPods, the Apple Watch, the company’s TV set-top box, Beats headphones and HomePods — continued to struggle. That business brought in $8.1 billion in sales, down 2.3%. Still, that was better than the $7.8 billion estimate.\n\nApple only made minor changes to its most recent smartwatch lineup, and a patent dispute forced it to remove a blood-oxygen feature from some models. The company also hasn’t updated its AirPods in several quarters.\n\nBut reinforcements are on the way: Apple is planning bigger displays for some watch models this fall, alongside a revamp to its low-end and mid-tier AirPods.\n\nThe upcoming iPhone 16 line should fuel a wave of demand. But the new models won’t include major design changes. The company’s iPhone 16 marketing pitch will be more about support for Apple Intelligence, faster processors, adding an Action button to the lower-end versions, and a camera-control button on the latest Pro models.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Apple reported Thursday third-quarter results that came ahead of Wall Street estimates, as a jump in services revenue helped offset softer iPhone revenue amid rising competition in China.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were trading marginally down in premarket trading Friday.\n\nThe company reported Q3 earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $85.8 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $84.45B.\n\nRevenue rose 5% as services revenue helped offset a slight decline in iPhone revenue.\n\nSales of its flagship iPhone handset device, which still makes up nearly half of total revenue, fell to $39.30B from $39.67B a year earlier, but beat estimates of $38.81B.\n\n\"Expectations for Apple's Q3 were fairly tepid, given that multiple new products, most notably the iPhone 16, are expected later this quarter,\" analysts at Third Bridge commented.\n\n\"It's worth noting that Apple is often considered a company that provides conservative guidance and focuses on execution.\"\n\nThe highlight of the report was the Services segment, which saw its revenue surge 14% to a record high of $24.21B, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.01B.\n\nMeanwhile, sales in China fell 6.5% to $14.72B as the iPhone has been facing rising competition in the region from local smartphone makers including Huawei.\n\nThe earnings call will dominate investor attention, with investors keen for details on guidance and Apple Intelligence.\n\n\"Overall numbers are ahead of expectations focus will be on GUIDE and Apple Intelligence commentary on the call but better China and stronger GMs are both better vs. buyside expectations,\" Evercore ISI said in a note following the results.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple said that revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter is expected to grow at a rate comparable to the 4.9% increase recorded in the April-June period, also above analysts' expectations.\n\n\"This was an upbeat conference call in our view as stronger September guidance is just the opening act for the main event which is an AI-driven super cycle starting with iPhone 16 launching in mid-September,\" said Wedbush analysts, raising their price target on Apple stock from $275 to $285.\n\nYasin Ebrahim contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple Q3 results beats estimates as services growth offsets softer iPhone sales\n\nAtlassian shares slump on Cloud revenue miss, analyst downgrade\n\nBlock stock jumps 6% after raising outlook, posting Q2 earnings beat\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Payrolls, slumping stocks, Apple, Amazon - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to end the week on a losing note as weak activity data has investors fretting about the possibility of a U.S. recession. Nonfarm payrolls will be studied for growth clues, while results from tech heavyweights Apple and Amazon will also be in the spotlight.\n\n1. Payrolls loom large\n\nFriday’s economic highlight will be the release of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report, as investors seek further clues on the health of the U.S. labor market and the broader economy.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\nThe unemployment rate, which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range on Wednesday, where it has been since last July, but also opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September.\n\nIn the accompanying statement the Fed softened the description of inflation and said the risks to employment were now on a par with those of rising prices.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that U.S. job openings fell modestly in June, while new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week.\n\nA weak U.S. ISM manufacturing report also added to fears of an economic downturn and led investors to worry that the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in cutting rates.\n\n2. Futures fall on recession fears\n\nU.S. stock futures fell Friday, as investors digested some disappointing earnings from the important tech sector while awaiting the release of the widely-watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nBy 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 225 points, or 0.5%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 48 points, or 0.9%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 295 points, or 1.6%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after a softer-than-expected ISM report on U.S. manufacturing caused investors to fret about a possible recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped almost 500 points, or 1.2%.\n\nInvestors will be focusing upon the official jobs report [see above] for more clues of the strength of the U.S. labor market, with risk sentiment ending the week on the back foot.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) released their earnings after the close Thursday [see below] and will be in the spotlight, as will Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) after the chipmaker said it would cut more than 15% of its workforce and suspend its dividend starting in the fourth quarter as it pursues a turnaround.\n\nStory continues\n\nStaying on the earnings front, oil majors Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) will be announcing their quarterly results Friday before the market open.\n\n3. Apple impresses despite Chinese woes\n\nApple reported Thursday third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, as a jump in services revenue helped offset softer iPhone revenue amid rising competition in China.\n\nThe tech giant’s stock rose 0.6% after hours, adding to gains of nearly 30% in the past three months, resulting in gains of around 13% over the course of this year.\n\nApple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than expectations.\n\nServices revenue rose 14% to record high of $24.21 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.01 billion.\n\nSales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected, although China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%.\n\nApple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei.\n\nDespite these difficulties, things could get better next quarter, as analysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September.\n\nThe company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June, and to operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices.\n\n4. Amazon reports slowing online sales growth\n\nAmazon stock slumped after hours after the online retail giant reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter, adding that price-conscious consumers were acting cautiously.\n\nAmazon’s online stores sales rose 5% in the second quarter to $55.4 billion, compared with growth of 7% in the first quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the company offered up third-quarter revenue guidance of $154-158.5 billion, short of expectations of $158.2 billion.\n\nCFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call that consumers \"are continuing to be cautious with their spending trading down.\"\n\n\"They are looking for deals,\" he added, noting that lower priced products were selling briskly.\n\nThis news has overshadowed generally positive results, with second-quarter profit and cloud computing sales beating analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon stock fell almost 7% after hours, but were still up over 20% year-to-date.\n\n5. Crude on track for fourth straight losing week\n\nCrude prices rose Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight week of losses given mounting concerns over slowing economic growth.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 1.1% to $77.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1% to $80.32 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks have declined around 8% over the last four weeks as disappointing economic data from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia, Europe and the United States raised concerns of weak global economic growth, weighing on oil consumption.\n\nThe weak economic prints saw markets largely look past heightened tensions in the Middle East after the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran earlier in the week.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, made no changes to its production policies after an online meeting on Thursday, reiterating that it could pause plans to increase output from October.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayrolls, slumping stocks, Apple, Amazon - what's moving markets\n\nStocks stumble on growth fears ahead of US payrolls\n\nSri Lanka needs to raise fiscal revenue to maintain stability, IMF says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Expects This Investment Holding to Balloon to $200 Billion of Berkshire's Portfolio. Hint: It's Not Apple.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett manages a massive portfolio for Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). As of this writing, Berkshire's equity holdings total around $400 billion.\n\nBy far the largest equity holding in the portfolio is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The Oracle of Omaha poured tens of billions of dollars into Apple stock between 2016 and 2018, amassing a huge stake in the iPhone maker. That stake is now worth around $173 billion.\n\nBut Buffett expects another asset held by Berkshire Hathaway to exceed $200 billion in value when Berkshire reports its second-quarter earnings, expected in early August. That is Berkshire's cash and cash equivalents balance, which Buffett invests almost all of in short-term Treasury bonds. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuilding a massive war chest\n\nBuffett hasn't seen a lot to like in the stock market recently. He's sold more equities than he bought for six consecutive quarters as of the first quarter this year. That includes two consecutive quarters of selling Apple shares, among others.\n\nIt wouldn't be a surprise if the August earnings report shows additional stock liquidation. And after selling $2.3 billion worth of Bank of America stock (and counting) in July already, he could make it eight quarters in a row.\n\nWhen you combine those stock sales with Berkshire Hathaway's cash generated from operations, it starts to add up fast. Berkshire's Treasury holdings ballooned from $109 billion at the end of the third quarter in 2022 to $189 billion 18 months later.\n\nBuffett knows the Treasury holdings are probably overkill. \"Your company also holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what conventional wisdom deems necessary,\" he wrote in his most recent letter to shareholders. He described the position as \"an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought to be fireproof.\"\n\nThe Treasury bill investment is intended to be a short-term investment, though. Buffett prefers bonds that mature in a few months over those that won't mature for years or decades. He learned that the hard way when he invested Berkshire's cash in 15-year bonds in the 1970s, amid rising inflation, only to regret it later as rising rates decimated the value of his holdings. Now, Buffett insists on safety over yield when it comes to short-term investments.\n\n\"We'd love to spend it,\" he said of the Treasury bills at this year's shareholder meeting. \"But we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and could make us a lot of money.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Berkshire grows bigger and bigger, those opportunities become fewer and farther between. Deploying tens of billions of dollars into acquiring a stock or an entire company -- especially one that fits Buffett's investment criteria -- isn't easy.\n\nShould investors buy Buffett's biggest holding?\n\nThe good news for investors is that they typically handle a portfolio that's worth less than the $600 billion in combined equities and treasuries Buffett's in charge of. That gives them a lot more room to maneuver.\n\nThat said, Buffett's growing investment in Treasuries and his inability to find a great investment for Berkshire shareholders suggests it's increasingly difficult to find a good investment opportunity regardless of the size of your portfolio. Nonetheless, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of about 57% since Buffett started selling more in equities than he purchased back in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nTo be sure, Berkshire has done just fine in that period. Its share price is up 64%, and operations are firing on all cylinders. But the company's Treasury bill holdings are just plugging along, offering yields around 5.3%. In all likelihood, Berkshire Hathaway would be worth even more as a company if Buffett hadn't sold any of its equity holdings over the past six quarters. Still, Buffett had plenty of good reasons to sell.\n\nIn that light, it makes sense that Buffett's top recommendation for investors is to buy an S&P 500 index fund. He recommends it even more than his own company's stock. While he believes there's a very good chance Berkshire will outperform the benchmark index over the next 10 years, he wouldn't want to bet his life on it, he told shareholders back in 2020.\n\nThat said, Berkshire stock looks like a great investment right now too. And long-term investors are probably best off limiting their exposure to Treasury bills unless they have short-term liquidity needs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Asian stocks slump on growth concerns; Nikkei hits 6-mth low in post-BOJ rout",
        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian stocks fell sharply on Friday, tracking an overnight rout on Wall Street on concerns over slowing economic growth, with a rout in Japanese markets deepening after the Bank of Japan struck a hawkish chord this week.\n\nWeak U.S. purchasing managers index and labor market data ramped up concerns over a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy, and that a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve could be potentially too late for the economy to achieve a soft landing.\n\nWeak earnings from majors such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also dented sentiment, largely offsetting a positive print from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). U.S. stock index futures fell sharply in Asian trade, with focus now turning to upcoming nonfarm payrolls data for more economic cues.\n\nNikkei hits 6-mth low in wake of hawkish BOJ\n\nJapanese markets were by far the worst performers among their Asian peers, with the Nikkei 225 index down nearly 5% to its weakest level since early-February. The broader TOPIX index shed 4.2%.\n\nJapanese stocks were already nursing sharp losses from Thursday, after the BOJ struck an unexpectedly hawkish tone during its end-July meeting.\n\nThe central bank hiked rates by 15 basis points and said it planned to raise rates further this year- presenting a clear end to the stimulative policies that boosted Japanese markets over the past year.\n\nA spike in the yen- on safe haven demand and on a hawkish BOJ- also weighed on Japanese stocks, particularly those with exposure to exports.\n\nToyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) (TYO:7203)- one of the biggest stocks on the Nikkei- fell 3.1% after its June quarter earnings slightly missed estimates, while the automaker also flagged slowing demand.\n\nAsian markets walloped by growth concerns\n\nBroader Asian markets all retreated, as risk appetite was battered by growing concerns over a global economic slowdown. Mixed technology earnings from the U.S. also sparked an extended rout in the sector.\n\nSouth Korea’s KOSPI slid 3.3% on deep losses in heavyweight chipmakers, following dismal earnings from Intel. Before that, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) had also clocked underwhelming earnings as artificial intelligence appeared to be providing only a limited boost.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 2.1% on losses in major Chinese internet stocks.\n\nAustralia’s ASX 200 index slid 2.4%, as mining stocks tracked deep losses in commodity prices, while concerns over slowing growth in China also weighed.\n\nBut Chinese markets logged relatively lower losses than their regional peers, given that they were already trading at five-month lows.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively, and were at their weakest levels since mid-February. Sentiment towards China remained weak following scant cues on stimulus from Beijing and a slew of weak PMI readings for July.\n\nFutures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a weak open, with the index set for a heavy degree of profit-taking after notching a record high above 25,000 points on Thursday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks slump on growth concerns; Nikkei hits 6-mth low in post-BOJ rout\n\nUS launches Nvidia antitrust probe after rivals' complaints, The Information reports\n\nPhilippine's Mynt gets valuation boost at $5 billion with Ayala, MUFG funding\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Markets Tumble on... Recession Fears? Plus AAPL, AMZN, INTC Earnings",
        "content": "Thursday, August 1st, 2024\r\n\r\nHere’s something we haven’t seen in a while. Markets sold off on fears of a recession today. After starting off across the board slightly in the green, the Dow slid -494 points, -1.2%, the Nasdaq -405 points, -2.3%, the S&P 500 and the small-cap Russell 2000 -1.37% and -3.03%, respectively. The Fed passed on cutting rates yesterday, and we now must wait through seven weeks of data before the next chance to cut. Will it be too late?\r\n\r\nEconomic Outlook Slipping Rapidly?\r\n\r\nWith Weekly Jobless Claims this morning coming in higher than expected — and higher than we’ve seen in a year — and a fairly paltry private-sector payroll headline from ADP ADP on Wednesday, it’s possible we’re seeing the hit to the labor market analysts feared with keeping the Fed funds rate at 5.25-5.50% for the past year. It will be a minimum of 14 months at this peak by the time of the mid-September meeting; incidentally, that’s almost exactly how long rates stayed above 5% back in 2006-2007, prior to the mortgage-led financial crisis.\r\n\r\nLet’s reiterate the last time we saw jobless claims at these levels was exactly one year ago. Thus, the drop we’re seeing here may be at least somewhat seasonal in nature. That said, both ISM Manufacturing and Construction Spending came in lighter than expected for the month today, with downward revisions for previous prints. But we’ll remain agnostic on the economy falling for now; the big Employment Situation report comes out tomorrow (Friday) morning.\r\n\r\nApple (AAPL) Surprises Higher in Q3\r\n\r\nThe world’s biggest gadget-maker, Apple AAPL, has outperformed estimates in both top and bottom lines for the company’s fiscal Q3 report. Earnings of $1.40 per share pushed past the $1.34 in the Zacks consensus, on $85.78 billion in quarterly revenues, easily outpacing the $84.43 billion expected, amounting to +5% growth year over year. Apple only has one earnings miss in the last five years.\r\n\r\niPhone sales also surpassed expectations in Q3: $39.3 billion versus $38.8 billion anticipated. Apple’s services segment also climbed to $24.21 billion, better than the $24.01 billion analysts were looking for, +14% year over year. AAPL shares are up +2% in today’s after-market, adding to the +17% gains the stock has made year to date. The conference call is slated for 3pm Pacific Time this afternoon.\r\n\r\nAmazon (AMZN) Mixed in Q2, Down -5% Late\r\n\r\nFellow “Mag 7” stock Amazon AMZN posted a beat on its bottom line in Q2 — earnings of $1.26 per share versus $1.05 anticipated — while coming up short on the top line: $147.9 billion, compared with the $148.6 billion estimate. This, despite +19% growth in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in the quarter. However, a weak revenue guide for Q3 of $154-158.5 billion (the previous Zacks consensus of $158.2 billion is now at the high range of AMZN’s sales outlook) is helping move shares down -5% in the after-market, cutting into the company’s +22% gains year to date.\r\n\r\nIntel (INTC) Misses in Q2, Stock Slides -17%\r\n\r\nThe world’s largest semiconductor company, Intel INTC, missed revenue estimates again — $12.83 billion versus $12.92 billion expected — on only its third earnings miss in the past five years: $0.02 per share versus $0.10 projected. But what seems to be sending shares even lower in late trading is the slashed guidance for Q3: the company now sees earnings of 3 cents per share on $12.5-13.5 billion is revenues — well off the Zacks consensus 29 cents and $14.28 billion, respectively. Thje company also plans to lay off 15% of its workforce, most by the end of this year. This isn’t a good sign for future employment numbers in the tech sector.\r\n\r\nDoorDash (DASH) Dashes Ahead +15% on Q2 Sales\r\n\r\nSan Francisco-based “last mile” delivery service DoorDash (DASH) posted strong revenue numbers in its Q2 quarter after Thursday’s close. The company brought in $2.63 billion on the top line, for a new record high revenue quarter, above the $2.54 billion expected and +23% year over year. Although earnings in the quarter recorded a bigger miss than expected, this was largely due to two one-time items for the quarter. Total Orders and Marketplace GOV (its total value of orders) also rose to record highs in the quarter, helping the company more than double its year-to-date gains.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "For the quarter ended June 2024, Apple (AAPL) reported revenue of $85.78 billion, up 4.9% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $1.40, compared to $1.26 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +1.59% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $1.34, the EPS surprise was +4.48%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China\n\n: $14.73 billion versus the two-analyst average estimate of $15.19 billion.

        "title": "3 Financial Stocks to Buy in August and Add on Dips",
        "content": "Investors continue to seek out top financial stocks to buy, as the macroeconomic winds appear to be shifting. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell all but served up a rate cut in September on a golden platter on Wednesday at the highly-anticipated Q&A session following the July interest rate session.\n\nAt this press conference, the chairman reiterated that the Fed is seeing signs that inflation is moving toward its target, and it may be time to start dialing down restrictive monetary policy. That means rate cuts, and the market appears to be implying it may mean more than one this year.\n\nFor certain financial stocks to buy, that’s a great thing for a number of reasons. Net interest margins should improve (the spread between the rate at which banks typically borrow and the rate at which they lend). And capital ratios and other metrics should get a boost as well. Additionally, valuation multiples for higher-growth fintech stocks should see a boost from such an environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this potentially lower-rate environment, here are three financial stocks to buy I think are worth focusing on right now.\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis past quarter was certainly a positive one for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). According to its CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan has exceeded market estimates and analyst expectations, but the company also issued general caution.\n\nDespite having interest concerns around where the economy could be headed, JPM stock flourished in its Q2 2024 numbers. The company reported $50.2 billion in revenue, surpassing the $42.23 billion consensus estimate number for the quarter. The bank also saw a $18.1 billion profit, exceeding its $17.3 billion forecast. This marks a significant improvement from 2023’s $14.47 billion figure.\n\nIn recent news, JPMorgan also released a generative AI product similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This tool aims to aid research analysts. The bank’s asset and wealth management employees received access to the LLM Suite for writing, idea generation and summarizing documents. Introduced earlier this year, around 50,000 employees now use it.\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) Mobile phone with website of US financial company Social Finance Inc (SoFi) on screen in front of logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the past 12 quarters, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI)  has been consistently impressing investors with its growth. In its most recent quarter, SoFi Money accounts increased by 61%, and debit transactions surged 150%. Despite trading under $10, SoFi’s revenue rose 35% in 2023, and its customer base grew 44%. The firm expanded services and projected 17.4% revenue growth through 2026. Though facing challenges, SoFi’s digital model attracts young users, ensuring long-term potential in a market dominated by banks with $9.5 trillion in assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi evolved from a student loan co-op to a major U.S. bank, growing rapidly despite smaller assets compared to big banks. New members reached 8 million from Q1’s 600,000. The company also saw a 38% rise in products sold, with the company selling over 12 million. This growth led to its first profitable quarter in Q4 2023, with continued profitability expected in 2024.\n\nSoFi’s three segments — lending, a fintech platform for businesses and personal financial services — saw increased product adoption in Q1. Financial services grew 42% year-over-year, driving high growth and profitability. I think this macro environment could certainly be conducive for continued growth moving forward.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters. financial stocks to buy\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) saw its stock decline over the past year, but potential rate cuts could drive a recovery. Lower rates may boost consumer spending and PayPal’s payment volumes. Despite recent sluggish stock performance, PayPal’s business remains strong, with the company’s Q1 report showing a 9% year-over-year sales increase, 14% rise in payment volumes, 18% EPS growth and an 86% increase in free cash flows. At just 1.9-times forward sales estimates, it’s an excellent buy.\n\nOwning companies with competitive advantages is smart, and PayPal has them. Its two-sided platform collects data from both merchants and consumers, enhancing fraud detection. This network effect strengthens its position: widespread acceptance attracts consumers, and merchants join to avoid losing sales.\n\nPayPal’s prospects improved after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was required to share its payment technology due to an EU settlement. This move opens competition opportunities for PayPal. Consequently, Mizuho Securities rated PayPal as “outperform” with a $90 price target.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in SOFI.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: “Forget AI...

        "title": "Apple Says US Smartphones Suit Has ‘No Relation to Reality’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said the US government’s antitrust lawsuit accusing the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market “bears no relation to reality” and should be tossed out by a federal judge.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Reporter to Be Freed by Russia in Major Prisoner Swap Kamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Ackman’s IPO Dream Implodes From $25 Billion to Zero in Weeks Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says Israel Says It’s Confirmed Hamas Number Two Deif Was Killed\n\nIn a court filing, Apple denied allegations that it is a monopolist and said it is not required to give software developers more access to iPhones than they currently have. The company has set the terms for access to its own platform and technologies, Apple argued in its filing, but hasn’t interfered or restricted third parties from dealing with its smartphone rivals. Those actions can’t be challenged under US antitrust law, the company said.\n\n“Apple faces robust competition from other smartphone manufacturers around the world, including Google and Samsung,” company lawyers argued Thursday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe complaint also fails to demonstrate that Apple’s conduct has harmed consumers — a key component of antitrust cases, the company said.\n\n“It is implausible to claim, as the government does, that Apple has deterred any customers from switching to Google or Samsung because of its policies with respect to ‘super apps,’ cloud gaming, smartwatches, or anything else,” according to the filing.\n\nIn March, the US Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general sued Apple for allegedly blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its popular devices. The suit alleges Apple used its power over app distribution on the iPhone to thwart innovations that would have made it easier for consumers to switch phones. Antitrust enforcers alleged the company has refused to support cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party digital wallets and non-Apple smartwatches, and blocked mobile cloud streaming services.\n\nFilings seeking to dismiss a lawsuit are common in antitrust cases, though they are rarely successful in cases brought by the government.\n\nUS District Judge Julien Neals, a Biden appointee who joined the bench in 2021, is likely to hold a hearing on Apple’s request to dismiss the case later this year.\n\nThe case is US v Apple, 24-cv-04055, US District Court, District of New Jersey.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products—and Broke Shopping in America How to Calculate the Value of an MBA Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship DC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Instead of Bank of America",
        "content": "Recent regulatory filings made by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) revealed that the holding company reduced its stake in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for the first time since 2019. Even the most favored of Warren Buffett stocks aren’t immune from a little profit-taking.\n\nOver three separate days in July, Berkshire sold 33.9 million shares of BAC stock for proceeds of nearly $1.5 billion and an average selling price of $43.56. According to WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire paid an average price of $25.68 for BAC shares. That indicates Buffett’s pre-tax profit was approximately $630 million.\n\nThat’s some gain, but then again, that’s what we’ve become accustomed to with Berkshire’s equity portfolio. Despite the sale, Bank of America remains Berkshire’s second-largest position accounting for 9.5% of its $398 billion portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBAC isn’t the only stock Berkshire should probably trim. However, I’m more interested in the Warren Buffett stocks the holding company should be adding to in 2024.\n\nHere are my three choices straight from CNBC’s Berkshire portfolio tracker.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 0.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio. It owns 10.0 million shares, or 0.1% of the Seattle company.\n\nBuffett often talks about how he missed an opportunity to buy Amazon stock early on in the company’s history. In 1994, when it was just a bookstore, he was given the opportunity to buy. He said no. He did again three years later in 1997 when it became public.\n\nIn 2019, before Berkshire bought Amazon stock, Buffett admitted that he missed the opportunity because, in his head, he couldn’t move from the bookselling business model to something more diversified and technologically driven.\n\n“I’d always admired Jeff,” Buffett told Yahoo Finance editor Andy Serwer. “I mean, I met him 20 years ago or so, and I thought he was something special, but I didn’t realize you could go from books to what’s happened there.”\n\nThanks to the company’s largest position, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Buffett knows a lot more about tech stocks, which should help him evaluate all the different revenue streams Amazon has and the potential new ones down the road.\n\nMitsubishi (MSBHF) Mitsubishi Motors Canadian headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF) is one of the five Japanese trading houses in which Berkshire first invested $6 billion in August 2020. He could not believe he could invest in these historic businesses.\n\n“I just thought these were big companies. They were companies that I generally understood what they did. Somewhat similar to Berkshire in that they owned lots of different interests,” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick in April 2023. “And they were selling at what I thought was a ridiculous price, particularly the price compared to the interest rates prevailing at that time.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHe boosted the holding company’s stakes in all five in April 2023. It now owns 8.6% of Mitsubishi, the largest ownership stake of the five; it accounts for 1.8% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio. The others account for 1.5%, 1.4%, 0.7% and 0.6%.\n\nHe said in 2023 he would consider buying more. That’s a smart move.\n\nA friend of mine from high school worked at the Canadian arm of Mitsubishi’s auto business after university. He stayed there for years and used to tell me about all the different businesses the parent company was into.\n\nIf there’s a business that Buffett understands backward and forward, it is the conglomerate, which is precisely what these trading houses are.\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) is one of the three big credit ratings companies along with S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch Group is owned 100% by privately held Hearst Corp.\n\nMoody’s is Berkshire’s eighth-largest holding accounting for 2.9% of the holding company’s equity portfolio. Its $11.3 billion stake represents 13.5% of Moody’s stock.\n\nBerkshire first bought MCO stock in Q4 2000. It owned 24 million shares as of Dec. 31, 2000. They were valued at approximately $617 million at the end of 2000. Today it owns 24.67 million, so it’s added about 670,000 shares over 24 years. That’s not much.\n\nIt reported Q2 2024 results on July 23. Revenues were up 22% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, while its earnings per share jumped 47% to $3.02. As a result, it raised its full-year EPS estimate to $11.20 at the midpoint of its guidance.\n\nIts stock isn’t cheap at about 42x its 2024 earnings but you have to pay for quality.\n\nFurther, based on its trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.09 billion and an enterprise value of $28.65 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 7.3%. Anything above 8% is value territory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and unlike the rest of its tech peers, the main story won’t be about AI growth.\n\nInstead, analysts and investors will be keeping an eye on iPhone sales out of China and whether Apple has managed to stem the tide of users flocking to that country’s homegrown rivals including Huawei.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are expecting Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.35 and revenue of $84.4 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Apple saw EPS of $1.26 and revenue of $81.7 billion in the same period last year.\n\nShares of Apple are up some 18.6% year-to-date, despite a difficult start to the year, thanks, in part, to the impact of the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in May where it showed off its Apple Intelligence software.\n\nBut the big question on investors’ minds is whether iPhone sales rose or fell in China. Apple has been contending with slowing phone sales in the region, with the company noting an 8% decline in sales in the second quarter, as homegrown competitors including Huawei and Xiaomi gain market share.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nAnd while some analysts, like JPMorgan’s Samik Chatterjee, believe sales in Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, rose in Q3, others including UBS Global Research’s David Vogt say sales likely fell some 6%.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Bloomberg say Apple will report Greater China revenue of $15.2 billion, down 3.1% versus the same quarter last year when Apple reported China revenue of $15.7 billion. Overall iPhone sales are expected to top out at $38.9 billion, down 1.8% year-over-year from the $39.6 billion Apple saw in Q3 2023.\n\nBut Apple is expected to make up for those declines in other areas including Services and iPad sales. Services revenue is set to hit $23.9 billion in the quarter, up from $21.2 billion in Q3 2023, while iPad sales are anticipated to reach $6.6 billion versus the $5.7 billion the segment pulled in during the same period last year. Those iPad sales projections come after Apple introduced its latest iPad models this year, including a new iPad Pro lineup running the company’s M4 chip.\n\nMac revenue should also grow modestly in the quarter, versus a decline of 7.3% last year. Wearables sales, which include the Apple Watch and AirPods, however, are expected to fall 5.9% year-over-year.\n\nBeyond Apple’s revenue numbers, analysts and investors will be on the lookout for any commentary on the rollout of the company’s Apple Intelligence beta to developers earlier this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe software, which is powered by Apple’s generative AI technology, is set to hit iPhones, iPads, and Macs later this fall, though according to Bloomberg’s Marc Gurman, it won’t land alongside the new iPhone in September. Instead, it should hit Apple devices sometime in October.\n\nAnalysts are torn on the potential impact of Apple Intelligence on iPhone sales in the year ahead, with some saying the software will kick off a fresh iPhone sales supercycle and others laying out more bearish expectations for the technology’s effect on Apple’s bottom line.\n\nImportantly, Apple Intelligence is only compatible with iPhone 15 Pro and newer phones, which all buy guarantees that any users desperate the get their hands on the technology will have upgrade to a new, more powerful phone as soon as it’s available.\n\nEither way, if Apple is going to turn Apple Intelligence into a hit, it’s going to need to ensure it has the capabilities that get customers excited to dive into the offering.

        "title": "Apple, Amazon Results Are Crucial for Nasdaq 100’s Next Leg",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Earnings from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. will be critical to give direction to the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by some of the benchmark’s worst — and best — days this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKamala Harris Wipes Out Trump’s Swing-State Lead in Election Dead Heat Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound Iran’s Leader Orders Retaliatory Strike on Israel, NYT Says Ukraine Receives First F-16 Fighter Jets After Long Wait Luxury Heir Alleges His $13 Billion Hermès Fortune Has Vanished\n\nThe pair are the last megacaps to release results until Nvidia Corp. at the end of August, and will set the tone for tech investors for the coming month. The reports, due after the close, will be scrutinized for how artificial intelligence is driving growth for Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and how the new technology is expected to boost demand for the next iPhone. They’ll also give investors some insight into the health of consumer spending.\n\nApple is under pressure to give more information about expected demand for its next iPhone models, which will include AI. The shares have rallied 15% since the firm unveiled long-awaited new AI features in June, and 28% since last quarter’s estimate-beating results, even after the recent rotation out of the tech sector. Amazon shares are up 23% this year.\n\nAfter those runups, “it feels like the energy could be much more to the downside if people want to continue to rebalance their portfolios and take profits,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. Any signs of weakness, especially in forecasts from the two companies, could be punished by investors, he said.\n\nStill, some analysts think that what Apple says about future iPhone sales and AI will be more important than this quarter’s numbers.\n\n“We expect iPhone commentary to be the key catalyst this quarter with bullish statements about iPhone 16 expectations and continued stability in China likely to drive shares higher,” wrote Evercore ISI analysts led by Amit Daryanani. New AI features, plus the “sizable portion” of iPhone users due for an upgrade, should spark a demand cycle from the December quarter through 2025, they added.\n\nRead: Apple’s AI iPhone Turns Skeptics Into Bulls and Raises Stakes\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report revenue of $84.5 billion in the quarter, up around 3% from the same time last year and returning to growth after a slip in the previous quarter.\n\nAI will also be front and center for Amazon. It’s the last of the hyperscalers to release results and follows Microsoft Corp. reporting slower growth in its Azure unit. The Amazon Web Services cloud business is expected to generate sales of nearly $26 billion in the quarter, growing more than 17% year-over-year. Amazon’s overall second-quarter revenue is expected to increase 11% to $148.8 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Given GenAI tailwinds, we believe AWS revenue growth likely accelerated in 2Q,” Citi analysts led by Ronald Josey wrote in a note. They also expect a beat for operating income given improved efficiencies in retail and continued strong advertising demand.\n\nAmazon’s results will also be an indicator on the strength of US consumer spending.\n\n“We’ve heard a lot of mixed reports this earnings season about how the consumer is doing. And let’s face it, there is a fair amount of discretion in the purchases that flow into Amazon’s core retail business,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. McDonald’s Corp. this week reported its first sales drop in four years as diners cut back, while Starbucks Corp. same-store sales also fell.\n\nRetail margin expansion has been a key driver of Amazon’s profitability and shares in the last year and a half, Stucky added. “That’s just as big if not bigger driver for Amazon’s ongoing profitability than what AI’s doing in the AWS space,” he said.\n\nOperating margin for the North America segment is expected to come in at around 5.8% in the second quarter — up significantly from last year — and continue to expand through the rest of the year. That excludes AWS, which has much higher operating margins.\n\nTruist analyst Youssef Squali also pointed to Amazon’s retail strength, along with AWS, as a key focus in the report.\n\n“Amid a weakening consumer, Amazon continues to gain share of global e-commerce and improve its value proposition to both merchants and consumers,” Squali wrote in note, reiterating his buy rating. “We see multiple growth vectors powering Amazon’s growth which keeps the stock compelling.”\n\nAnd any change in tone on capital returns — as we highlighted last week — could also keep shares going. With a cash hoard that’s expected to top $100 billion this year, conditions have never been more favorable for the firm to join megacap peers in returning cash.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp.’s wild ride this week is headed for the record books. The world’s third-most-valuable company added a record $329 billion in value on Wednesday — obliterating the single-day record that it has repeatedly set in the past few months. The gains came a day after a 7% rout and as peer Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nMeta Plaforms Inc. reported better-than-expected sales in the second quarter, signaling that the company’s investments in AI are helping it sell more targeted ads. Shares gained in pre-market trading. Applied Materials Inc. was informed by US officials that it won’t be receiving Chips Act money for a long-anticipated research and development center, dealing a critical blow to a much-touted project in the heart of Silicon Valley. Qualcomm Inc., the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, saw a post-market rally sputter on Wednesday, fueled by concerns that the phone market is recovering more slowly than investors had hoped. Arm Holdings Plc shares tumbled in late trading after the chip company held off on boosting its annual forecast, raising concerns that it’s not confident in future growth prospects. The US is considering unilateral restrictions on China’s access to AI memory chips and equipment capable of making those semiconductors as soon as next month, a move that would further escalate the tech rivalry between the world’s biggest economies.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nInsight Enterprises Macom Arrow Electronics Vontier Corp Allegro MicroSystems Itron ACI Worldwide Belden InterDigital Lightspeed Commerce Inc BigCommerce BCE Roblox Sirius XM Criteo Altice USA Gannett Co Thryv Holdings Inc Bandwidth Marcus Corp Postmarket\n\nApple Intel Snap Roku Cable One Skillz Inc Motorola Solutions Microchip Atlassian Monolithic Power MicroStrategy Cloudflare CoreCard GoDaddy Gen Digital Universal Display Procore Technologies Twilio Open Text Altair Eng Marathon Digital Holding Workiva RingCentral Mirion Technologies Silicon Motion Sprout Social Corsair Gaming OneSpan Inc Bigbear.ai\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA Inside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter ‘Dancing With Death’: What It’s Like to Dismantle a Ship Scammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta’s Own Tools The Miseducation of America’s Nurse Practitioners\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release earnings results for its third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors are eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company currently has a dividend yield of 0.45%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents a share ($1.00 a year).\n\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Apple, we start with a yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\n\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Apple's $1.00 dividend: $6,000 / $1.00  = 6,000 shares\n\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,332,480 worth of Apple, or 6,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\n\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares, or $266,496 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nView more earnings on AAPL\n\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\n\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple rose 1.5% to close at $222.08 on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report quarterly earnings at $1.35 per share, up from $1.18 per share in the year-ago period. The company is projected to post revenue of $84.53 billion, compared to $76.41 billion a year earlier.\n\nOn Thursday, analysts will also be looking at Apple’s streaming results and its ability to balance ad-free plans with ad-supported plans. Apple is one of the newer companies in the streaming space and could soon be launching an ad-supported plan.\n\nRead Next:\n\nJim Cramer Says This Home Improvement Chain Is A Buy Ahead Of Fed Rate Cut Cycle: ‘I Would Pick Some Up Tomorrow’\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "4 Top Tech Stocks to Buy on Soaring Hopes of September Rate Cut",
        "content": "Wall Street rebounded on Jul 31, led by a tech rally, as investors now strongly believe that the Federal Reserve will implement its first interest rate cut in September.\n\nThe S&P 500 1.6% to end at 5,522.30, while the Nasdaq rose 2.6% to close at 17,599.40. Both the indexes recorded their best session since February. The Dow also rose 0.2% to finish at 40,842.79 points.\n\nThe rebound came as the Federal Reserve, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, kept interest rates unchanged in the current range of 5.25-5.5%. A small section of market participants was hopeful that the Fed could start its interest rate cuts in July but that didn’t happen.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve Chairman, in his first press conference after the end of the July FOMC meeting, said that if data gives central bank officials the confidence that inflation is easing steadily, it could start its easing cycle.\n\n“If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table as soon as the next meeting in September,” Powell said.\n\nInflation has declined substantially over the past couple of months after rising in the first quarter. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, the Fed’s key inflation gauge, rose 0.1% sequentially in June, which was in line with economists’ expectations.\n\nYear over year, PCE rose 2.5% in June after increasing 2.6% in May. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2% month over month in June and 2.6% year over year.\n\nAlso, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the second quarter, double the pace from the first quarter and sharply higher than economists’ expectations of a rise of 2%.\n\nMarket participants are now confident that the Federal Reserve will start its easing cycle with a 25-basis point rate cut in September followed by two more by the end of this year. Lower borrowing rates typically help growth-oriented assets like technology stocks. Moreover, tech stocks have been driving the market rally since 2023.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in mega-cap tech stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN,Apple, Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Netflix, Inc. NFLX that have strong potential for 2024.\n\nThese stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe. AMZN’s online retail business revolves around the Prime program well-supported by the company’s massive distribution network. Further, the Whole Foods Market acquisition helped Amazon establish its footprint in the physical grocery supermarket space. AMZN also enjoys a dominant position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the Infrastructure as a Service space, thanks to Amazon Web Services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com has an expected earnings growth rate of 58.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. AMZN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nApple Inc.’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. However, the Services portfolio of AAPL, which includes revenues from cloud services, the App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has now become the cash cow. Moreover, non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPod have gained significant traction.\n\nApple has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last 60 days. APPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.5% over the last 30 days. NVDA presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 58.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 4.2% over the past 60 days.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nGene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that the key reason behind the latest decline in tech stocks was major companies projecting high CapEx and giving no updates on AI monetization. Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending “cannot slow down.”\n\n“I am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you’re gonna boil it down to one point, it’s gonna be higher for longer and it’s good for AI.”\n\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\n“If you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.”\n\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a “spectacular bubble burst.”\n\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Famous Analyst Say You Should Buy the Dip on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Stock?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nGene Munster continues to be bullish on Apple.\n\nDoes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) have any AI growth catalysts? Wall Street is turning bullish on the company after Apple revealed Apple Intelligence plans at the WWDC event.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ship nearly 500 million iPhones in the next two years, marking a 6% increase from the FY21-FY22 cycle. Morgan Stanley said this growth can boost the annual iPhone average selling price (ASP) by 5%, leading to nearly $485 billion in revenue and $8.70 in earnings per share by FY26, exceeding consensus estimates by 7-9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street is expecting a new AI-powered refresh cycle for iPhones because it’s been years since millions of users upgraded their iPhones. Wedbush recently said 270 million, of 1.5 billion iPhones, have not upgraded in 4+ years\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also training Siri based on its own language models. These smaller models run on devices, handling various daily tasks, with Apple revealing its on-device model has 3 billion parameters. For more complex tasks, a larger language model runs on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) private servers, though its size is undisclosed and likely smaller than current large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, which has around 1.8 trillion parameters.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Apple, Vanguard Information Technology ETF, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF, iShares US Technology ETF and iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – August 1, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETFs featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks and ETFs recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nApple (AAPL) ETFs to Buy Ahead of Fiscal Q3 Earnings\n\nAll eyes are on technology giant Apple, which is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close on Aug 1. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\n\nApple reclaimed the most valuable title last month and emerged as one of the strongest performers relative to the other “Mag 7” amid the recent sell-off. The stock has gained about 28.5% over the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.4%. The solid trend is expected to continue, given that the tech giant has a strong chance of beating earnings estimates. It has seen positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\nThis has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. The following ETFs have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation. These ETFs have a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nApple saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the fiscal third quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 6.3% for earnings and 3.2% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.14% in the trailing four quarters (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\n\nThe stock currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 30 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.68 a month ago based on 30 recommendations. Of the 30 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 20 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 66.67% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 63.33%, while Buy represented 10%.\n\nBased on the short-term price targets of 32 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $232.22. The forecasts range from a low of $180.00 to a high of $300.00.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally turning around following the launch of a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs in June. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).\n\nThe technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple also announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. The company released a beta version of its new iOS 18.1 to developers early this week, offering the first look of Apple Intelligence and some of the iPhone maker's new artificial intelligence features.\n\nAccording to LSEG data, the tech titan is expected to win back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts and by selling more high-margin iPads with a refreshed design. iPhone sales are expected to decrease 2.2% in the to-be-reported quarter, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter. This suggests that the worst might be over for Apple.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the iPhone maker expects overall revenues \"to grow low-single digits\" and iPad revenues to grow in double digits.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF - Apple accounts for a 16.1% share.\n\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF - Apple accounts for a 16% share in the basket.\n\niShares US Technology ETF - Apple makes up 16.1% of the assets.\n\niShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF - Apple accounts for a 13.8% share in the basket.\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.\n\nGet it free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Fed guidance, BOE, Meta's results, Apple - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged but signaled the possibility of a cut next month. The Bank of England has that decision to make later in the session. Meta Platforms impressed with its quarterly earnings, and Apple is next up after the close.\n\n1. Fed lifts September rate cut confidence\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its latest policy-setting meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected, but acknowledged recent progress on inflation, raising investor hopes that the central bank could begin cutting rates in the near future.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, kept its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as it has done over the past year as it battled elevated inflation.\n\nHowever, recent data point to progress on inflation, suggesting that the Fed's restrictive policies are working.\n\n\"Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,\" the Fed said Wednesday in its July policy statement, with the addition of the word “somewhat” marking a subtle change from its June statement.\n\nA September rate cut of 25 basis points is now almost fully priced in, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, but traders also added to bets the Federal Reserve will go big when it does cut.\n\nRate futures prices now reflect about a 17% chance of a 50-basis point rate cut in September, versus about 5% before Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nThe Fed also acknowledged a cooling in the labor market, stating that the committee is \"attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate\" - to maintain stable prices and strive for maximum employment.\n\nFriday sees the release of the closely watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report, as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July.\n\nEconomists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month.\n\n2. Futures steady after Fed meeting\n\nU.S. stock futures traded in a steady manner Thursday, as investors digested the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as more corporate earnings.\n\nBy 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 7 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 45 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe Wall Street indices closed higher Wednesday, with the S&P 500 gaining 16%, its best day since February, the Nasdaq Composite surging 2.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%.\n\nThese gains followed the Fed signaling that a rate cut could occur in September if inflation continues to cool.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) [see below] and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).\n\nEconomic data due for release Thursday includes weekly jobless claims data, construction spending for June and ISM Manufacturing data for July, ahead of Friday’s widely-watched monthly jobs report.\n\n3. Meta soars after impressive Q2\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reported strong second-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, bucking the recent trend of poorly received results from the country’s mega cap tech companies.\n\nMeta Platforms, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue, seeing quarterly growth of 22%.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts on a call that the company was \"continuing to see healthy global advertising demand\", benefiting from its plans to use artificial intelligence to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\n\nThe tech giant also issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial-intelligence investments.\n\nAlthough Meta's costs rose 7% in the second quarter, its revenue jump topped expense growth substantially and led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, to 38% from 29%.\n\nMeta stock soared over 7% after hours, contrasting with the losses that both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) suffered when they released these numbers over the last few days.\n\n4. Apple revenue to bounce back in Q3\n\nIt’s Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) turn to face the judgment of investors, as the iPhone maker releases its fiscal third-quarter results after the close Thursday.\n\nApple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, bouncing back after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter, as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple in May offered hefty discounts on select iPhone models, helping narrow sales declines in the country.\n\nElsewhere, iPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for this product line.\n\nApple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record.\n\n5. Bank of England to cut?\n\nThe Bank of England completes this week’s round of central bank rate decisions later Thursday, after the Bank of Japan delivered its second interest rate hike in 17 years and the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted it could lower rates in September after standing pat.\n\nThe moves, or lack of them, by the BOJ and the Fed were largely expected, but there is greater uncertainty than usual of the Bank of England's meeting as key policymakers have not spoken publicly for more than two months in the run-up to the country’s general election in early July.\n\nThe Bank of England has held its benchmark interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the past year as it tackled inflation, which soared to a 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nU.K. consumer price inflation returned to the BOE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, suggesting a cut later Thursday is a distinct possibility.\n\nIn June, the MPC voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the meeting recorded that several of those who voted to hold had been close to voting for a cut.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed guidance, BOE, Meta's results, Apple - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ sees chance wages, inflation could overshoot\n\nAnalysis-BOJ governor's hawkish streak signals more hikes to come\n\nView comments",

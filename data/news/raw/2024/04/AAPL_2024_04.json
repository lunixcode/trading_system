        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department's double-barreled antitrust attack on Google's dominant search and Apple's trendsetting iPhone is reviving memories of the epic battle that hobbled Microsoft before it roared back to yet again become the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe parallels to the Justice Department's landmark antitrust case in 1998 could provide a window into the potential breakthroughs that could be unleashed if regulators succeed in their attempts to crack down on Google and Apple.\n\nFederal lawyers have even gone as far as to assert Google and Apple may never have created so many popular products or become as powerful as they are now if Microsoft hadn't been reined in a quarter century ago.\n\nIn closing arguments of a Washington, D.C., trial that began last September, regulators Thursday will apply the finishing touches to a case alleging Google has turned its search engine into an illegal monopoly that stifles competition and innovation. The Apple case, which was only filed a month ago, is still years away from its resolution.\n\nAlthough regulators have lodged separate complaints against Google and Apple, the two cases are shadowed by Microsoft's legal saga that began when both those were mere specks on the technology landscape.\n\nWhen they went after Google in October 2020, regulators compared the lucrative deals that the company cut with Apple to lock its search engine into the iPhone and Safari web browser to the same tactics Microsoft deployed in its personal computer software to block competition.\n\nAnd in the antitrust lawsuits that they filed against Apple last month, the Justice Department pointed back to complaints that company co-founder Steve Jobs had raised in 1998 against Microsoft's “dirty tactics” while urging regulators to take steps to force the PC software maker “to play fair.”\n\nAnd that is what the Justice Department did in an antitrust case against Microsoft that caused massive distractions that opened the door for Google's search engine to become the internet's main gateway. It also culminated in a series of concessions that paved the way for Apple to extend the reach of its iTunes music store that increased the popularity of the iPod that spawned the iPhone.\n\nThe Microsoft case \"created new opportunities for innovation in areas that would become critical to the success of Apple’s consumer devices and the company itself,\" the Justice Department crowed in the lawsuit that casts the iPhone as an illegal monopoly.\n\nAfter years of mostly fruitless attempts to compete against Google's search engine and the iPhone under the leadership of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft began to regain its stride when Satya Nadella became CEO in 2014.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft's market value hit $3 trillion for the first time, surpassing Apple as the world's most valuable company while taking the early lead in artificial intelligence technology that's expected to reshape the world.\n\nIt's an odd juxtaposition that has thrust regulators into battling two companies they helped create when they caged a colossus now angling to seize the mantle in technology's next frontier.\n\nBut it's also a tableau that antitrust experts cite as evidence that the system is working to unlock more robust competition that hatches innovations. And then those breakthroughs sometimes serve as the building blocks for new monopolies that must eventually be challenged by regulators, even as fallen empires like Microsoft can still find ways to reinvent themselves.\n\n“It's not about an agenda about trying to pursue and destroy companies, it's about trying to restore competition in a market,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who focuses on antitrust law issues. “What has happened with the Microsoft case is a success story that can also provide a blueprint for Apple and Google when people ask why is America trying to destroy its most successful companies? Microsoft has done great after it had a major antitrust claim against it.”\n\nThe Justice Department's landmark case against Microsoft was not the first time an antitrust lawsuit turned into a springboard for other companies to emerge as dominant forces that eventually need to be corralled, too.\n\nFor instance, separate antitrust lawsuits filed against IBM in 1969 and AT&T in 1974 helped pave the way for Microsoft and Apple to launch the personal computer revolution that subsequently spawned the internet boom that was followed by the smartphone explosion.\n\nThose are the kinds of innovations that have fueled economic growth and society-shifting products that might not have happened had antitrust regulators stayed on the sidelines while IBM and AT&T continued to exploit their respective monopolies, Yale University economics professor Fiona Scott Morton said.\n\n“When you innovate successfully, you can grow like crazy but then it's 20 years later and it's hard to keep growing like you were,” said Scott Morton, who once was chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division. \"So instead of just relying on innovation, you realize, ‘Hey we have a lot of market power, we could use that to raise profits.’\n\n“It's just very natural that's what happens repeatedly and regulators have to say, ‘No, that part isn’t allowed, you have to compete on the merits.' And oftentimes when you succeed in forcing more competition, somebody else ends up winning the next race.”\n\nAfter the closing arguments in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google wrap up this week, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue his ruling in the late summer or early autumn. Meanwhile, the case against Apple will continue to progress in New Jersey federal court while antitrust regulators examine whether Microsoft is once again crossing the line to gain an unfair advantage in the still-nascent field of AI.\n\nView comments",

This expansion followed the acquisitions of two local AI startups, leading to the creation of the “Vision Lab” in Zurich.\n\nThe Zurich team has contributed to research on advanced AI models that merge text and visual inputs, which are crucial for products like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple has advertised several generative AI positions in Zurich, maintaining a low profile in the area.\n\nThe company plans to showcase new generative AI features at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, potentially transforming the next iPhone into a more sophisticated voice-activated assistant with an enhanced Siri capable of interacting with all apps via voice control.\n\nApple analysts projected a slight increase in revenue for the March quarter and a significant guide-down for the June quarter compared to consensus, followed by a negative market reaction.\n\nThe critical event following the earnings will be Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where analysts anticipate new AI software features will be a significant highlight, with Apple experiencing a relief rally.\n\nAnalysts will be closely watching the March quarter for total revenue, focusing on revenue from China (where he expects iPhone shipments to be down 28% year-over-year) and growth in Services revenue, which he projects at 12.7% year-over-year.\n\nApple stock gained over 2% in the last 12 months.

Total Q1 earnings for these companies are up +3.1% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 59.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 52.8%. The 52.8% 'blended' beats percentage compares to 53.4% for this group of 267 index members in 2024 Q4, 55.8% in each of the two preceding periods and the average for this group of companies over the preceding 20 quarters (five years) of 59%.\n\nExcluding the Energy sector drag, whose Q1 earnings are down -29.8%, total earnings for the rest of the index that have reported results would be up +6.8%.\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are on track to be up +3.9% on +4.1% higher revenues. Excluding the Energy sector, Q1 earnings would be up +6.7% on +4.5% higher revenues.\n\nFor more details about the Q1 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Breaking Down Q1 Earnings Results\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nApple shares have lagged the broader market as well as the Tech sector this year, reflecting competitive pressurs and the uncertain China outlook. Growing legal complexities, including ongoing EPIC and Masimo lawsuits and the latest case by the U.S. Department of Justice, have been a headwind.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to have hurt fiscal second-quarter revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. Nevertheless, the Services segment is expected to report strong results, driven by solid adoption of Apple TV+, Apple Pay and Apple Music. The updated MacBook and iMac lineup has helped Apple gain a share in the PC market.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Apple Vision Pro, a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world, has expanded Apple’s non-iPhone portfolio. The company’s strong cash balance and shareholder-friendly approach to dividends and share repurchase are noteworthy.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Walmart have modestly outperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (+21.0% vs. +20.2%). The company gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. Walmart has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nThe strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled Walmart’s fourth-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\r\n\r\nHowever, the retail landscape continues to be dynamic due to challenges like inflation and volatile consumer spending. High SG&A expenses are also a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Walmart here >>>)\r\n\r\nChevron shares have gained +3.5% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s gain of +9.4%. Despite the underperformance, the company is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana.\r\n\r\nHowever, the company is grappling with lower prices in the upstream segment and declining refining margins in the downstream unit. Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Aon plc (AON), Carrier Global Corporation (CARR) and American Water Works Company, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of the sports industry, go directly to the 5 Richest Billionaires in Sports Industry.\n\nSports Industry Outlook\n\nSports is one of the most diversified industries in the world with sectors including esports, gambling, fitness, sporting clubs, media rights, and sporting goods and services, among others. According to a report by Research and Markets, the global sports market was valued at $480.12 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $506.93 billion in 2024. By 2028, the market is estimated to cross $629.81 billion, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. North America remains a key sports market, with football, basketball, baseball, and boxing as the most popular sports in the region. The North American sports Team and Club market generated gross revenue of around $84 billion in 2023, per a report by Mordor Intelligence. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.2% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nThe growing sports market is attributed to potential investments in sponsorships and sports growing across new economies. For instance, the Middle Eastern countries are massively investing in Football. According to a report by Deloitte, Saudi Pro League clubs spent nearly $957 million in the 2023 summer transfer window. Saudi Pro League’s net spend during the 2023 transfer window was $907 million, which was significantly higher than the ‘big five’ leagues, only second to the Premier League’s net transfer spend of $1.39 billion.

        "content": "Huawei released a new high-end smartphone in August made largely with home-grown microchips - STR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHuawei’s profits have surged more than six-fold after the Chinese technology champion overcame Western sanctions to steal market share from Apple.\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company reported a 19.6bn yuan (£2.1bn) profit in the three months to March, up 564pc on the same period a year ago.\n\nThis comes despite facing US export controls and bans on overseas sales of its networking equipment in the last year, including in the UK.\n\nThe company released a new high-end smartphone in August that was made largely with home-grown microchips.\n\nThis proved to be a surprise hit among Chinese consumers and helped Huawei squeeze sales of Apple’s iPhone in the Far East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt has also been developing advanced artificial intelligence chips in an attempt to compete with Silicon Valley giant Nvidia, which has seen its sales to China curbed by the Biden administration.\n\nChina has invested heavily in catching up to the US and Taiwan in advanced semiconductor production, reaping rewards for companies like Huawei that have struggled to get hold of foreign-made chips.\n\nHuawei said revenues had risen by 37pc in the quarter to 178.5bn yuan. The sales came in the critical Chinese New Year period when shoppers typically spend heavily on electronics.\n\nThis marks a stark reversal in Huawei’s fortunes after chief executive Guo Ping said in 2020 that the company’s goal was “survival” after “nonstop aggression from the US government”.\n\nIn December, the company said it was “back on track”, claiming it had weathered the storm after reporting an increase in annual revenues.\n\nAccording to research firm Counterpoint, Huawei’s smartphone sales in China rose by 70pc in the first quarter of the year, putting it almost level with Apple.\n\nBy comparison, Apple’s sales are believed to have fallen sharply. The US tech giant is expected to reveal the scale of its China sales fall on Thursday when it reports results for the first three months of the year.\n\nChina has discouraged government employees from bringing foreign-made devices to work.\n\nHuawei is also investing heavily in smart car technology, seeking deals with major carmakers.",

        "title": "4 ETFs to Tap the Renewed AI Craze on Wall Street",
        "content": "After a brief lull, the fervor for artificial intelligence (AI) investments is back with a bang on Wall Street. This revival has been buoyed by upbeat quarterly performances of tech biggies like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, coupled with a successful IPO debut for Rubrik RBRK last week (read: Alphabet Joins $2T Club, More Growth Likely: ETFs to Win).\n\nThis puts focus on AI ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, iShares Robotics And Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF IRBO, First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF ROBT and Themes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF WISE.\n\nStellar Performances by Some Tech Titans\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet, two behemoths in the tech industry, delivered outstanding quarterly results, reigniting confidence in the potential of AI-driven growth. Microsoft's Azure cloud division witnessed a handsome 31% revenue jump, with considerable contribution from AI services. Similarly, Google reported a surge of 28% in its cloud revenues, attributing the growth to increasing contributions from AI technologies.\n\nConcrete Evidence of AI Demand\n\nAnalysts point out that the robust performances of Microsoft and Google provide tangible evidence of the real demand for AI solutions. For those who were skeptical about the tangibility of the AI boom, recent announcements of material investments in AI by Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet acted as an eye-opener.\n\nAlthough the AI race is often led by Microsoft and Google, its scope goes beyond these tech giants. Despite recent pullbacks, analysts are bullish on Meta’s initiatives. Many Wall Street analysts are thus recommending buying into such opportunities.\n\nElon Musk called Tesla (TSLA) an AI and Robotics company, not just an auto company. Tesla's self-driving vehicles will be based on its AI-based self-driving technology called FSD V12. Elon Musk also indicated that any company that isn't outlaying $10 billion on AI this year, like Tesla, will not be able to keep pace.\n\nSamsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker, forecast that demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten the supply of some high-end chips. The company reported a more than 10-times rise in first-quarter operating profit.\n\nSamsung looks to boost the supply of high bandwidth memory (HBM)-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year. These chips are used in generative AI chipsets. Samsung intends to leverage the AI boom that has benefited its smaller peer SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to NVIDIA, per Reuters.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnticipating Key Earnings Reports\n\nAs the AI frenzy continues, all eyes are on upcoming earnings reports from tech giants like Amazon and Apple. Amazon is slated to report today, after market close. These reports can serve as critical tests for the AI tech trade amid soaring valuations. Notably, Amazon expects to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business through AI initiatives.\n\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +7.51% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our surprise prediction methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter (read: Why Should You Buy Amazon ETFs Ahead of Q1 Earnings?).\n\nAmazon invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that allows companies to use pre-existing functional modules to build GenAI applications. Also, Amazon launched one of the most capable coding assistants around in Amazon Q. In March, Amazon increased its investment in the AI startup Anthropic, injecting another $2.75 billion to bring its total investment to $4 billion.\n\nApple, which will report on May 2, will likely unveil AI initiatives later this year, although we expect the company to shed light on its AI moves in its post-earnings analyst call this quarter. The company reportedly acquired Canadian AI startup DarwinAI earlier this year, which has developed technology that makes AI technology accessible to a wide variety of industries.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nWith AI technology rapidly advancing and becoming increasingly integral to various industries, investors must be looking for ways to capitalize on this trend. Below, we highlight a few AI-focused ETFs for investors.\n\nGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) – Expense Ratio: 0.69%; Up 4% past week\n\niShares Robotics And Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO) – Expense Ratio: 0.47%; Up 3.6% past week\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (ROBT) – Expense Ratio: 0.65%; Up 3.6% past week\n\nThemes Generative Artificial Intelligence ETF (WISE) – Expense Ratio: 0.35%; Up 5% past week\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story)\n\nBy Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the latest stocks Jim Cramer is recommending. If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nJim Cramer is concluding April by talking about some specific stocks whose performance could give investors insights into the market dynamics today. On Monday, Cramer said during his program on CNBC that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s recent rise is \"instructive of what can make a stock go higher in this dynamic market.\"\n\nElon Musk Bags a \"Terrific Rabbit\"\n\nCramer said he's been saying that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares would keep tanking until and unless \"Elon Musk pull a rabbit out of the hat.\" Cramer said while Musk wasn’t able to find \"that rabbit\" in time for the quarter, he was able to \"bag a terrific one\" on the weekend as the company received in-principle approval from China to deploy its driver-assistance system. The stock jumped about 15% on the news. This development, according to Cramer, could give Elon Musk a \"whole new revenue stream\" and offset the effects of \"vicious\" price cuts in China.\n\nCramer also talked about Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s latest deal with Baidu, which he called the \"Google of China.\" The deal, according to media reports, is related to Baidu's mapping and navigation functions, and could clear a hurdle for Tesla to start operating its autonomous driving technology in China.\n\nJim Cramer said that Elon Musk is \"doing something no American CEO can do, just get on a plane and make a deal with the leader of a country\" that our government is not fond of. Because of this, according to Cramer, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shareholders are loving Elon Musk since the stock is up significantly, making a \"fool of last week's downgraders.\"\n\nCramer said that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares can \"keep running\" until its \"shorts are crushed.\"\n\nShould You \"Buy The Fear\" on Apple? Cramer Shares His Thoughts\n\nJim Cramer also talked about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is up after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi upgraded it, urging investors to \"buy the fear,\" with an $195 price target. Cramer highlighted Sacconaghi's thesis which says that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be entering a \"seasonably strong trading period.\" The analyst also said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s problems in China might be \"cyclical\" and the stock is a buy because of its low valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut does Cramer agree with Toni Sacconaghi? Cramer reiterated that for the past 20 years he's believed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock should be held, not traded. He also said that Toni Sacconaghi is an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"skeptic\" as in February 2018 the analyst downgraded the stock and cut his price target to $170. Adjusting for Apple's stock split, the analyst's projections turned out to be wrong. Cramer said that Toni Sacconaghi is a \"leader\" of the \"contingent\" which has been saying that Apple's \"glory days\" are behind us. Cramer also said he doesn’t care about Toni Sacconaghi's estimates and projections and feels the analyst's bullish call on the stock might \"jinx it.\" However, Jim Cramer yet again recommended investors to buy the stock, albeit after a pullback.\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on and recommends investors to buy. With each stock we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer said he was \"waiting\" for someone to bring Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) stock up. Cramer is bullish on the company because of its partnership with Nvidia. Cramer said Nvidia talked about Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RXRX) \"endlessly\" at the \"great\" GTC conference.\n\n\"I think you have a real winner. The stock went up around the conference and it has come right back down. Recursion is for me.\"\n\nRXRX is a small company which Cramer likes. He is also recommending Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the long term.\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings call, Recursion talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"Then in July, a month later, we announced our collaboration with NVIDIA.\n\nThis included a $50 million equity investment. And with our partners at NVIDIA, we’re working on advanced computation, so foundation model development; we’ve got priority access to compute hardware, which I’ll talk about later; and the DGXCloud Resources and we talked with them about the potential for us to put some of our tools into their BioNeMo marketplace. And in fact, just last month in January at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we released the first third-party tool to exist on NVIDIA’s BioNeMo platform. That was our Phenom-Beta foundation model in January of 2024. So very excited about this ongoing collaboration. One month later in August, we were able to deliver a demonstration of how we leveraged the May acquisition of Cyclica and our brand new partnership with NVIDIA to drive a real value into our platform.\n\nWe were able to predict the protein ligand interactions for more than 36 billion compounds from the N Enamine REAL Space across about 80,000 predicted binding pockets spanning the human proteome. And what this did was generate a large in silico data layer for us, a synthetic data layer.\"\n\nRead the detailed earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about oil and gas pipeline company Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD). He said that the company has the \"best network\" of fractionators in America. He hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD).\n\n\"I can't say enough positive things,\" Cramer said.\n\n8. Caseys General Stores Inc (NASDAQ:CASY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program called food and grocery company Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) a \"gem\" and hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on the stock.\n\n\"Loved the pizza there.. that is a winner, it should be bought, it's not that expensive given its growth prospects. I wish they'd split the stock.\"\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy made the following comment about Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Strategy’s consumer staples holdings also fared well. One of our top performers was Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY), which operates convenience stores and gas stations. The company continues to drive greater growth and improve internal performance through the expansion of its private label offerings, while a cooling labor market has helped alleviate wage pressures on margins. By deliberately focusing its geographic footprint on smaller communities, the company has high market share in the regions it serves as well as pricing power, which we believe will continue to be long-term earnings drivers.”\n\n7. Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nWhen asked about energy drinks company Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), Jim Cramer said that he's \"liking\" Celsius. Cramer said Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) went down \"because of Monster, but the problems with Monster are really the win for Celsius.\"\n\nJim Cramer was referring the Monster Beverage's declines that came after the stock was hit by two downgrades from notable Wall Street analysts. JPMorgan decreased its rating for the stock to Neutral from Overweight, while Truist Securities downgraded the stock to Sell.\n\nLike CELH, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We initiated new GardenSM positions in Equifax, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) and Xylem during the quarter. Celsius is an energy drink company viewed as providing a healthier option than its large competitors. We believe Celsius’ product portfolio appeals to a broad demographic, attracting new consumers and more frequent usage occasions in the energy drink category, enabling Celsius to grow sales through market share gains and market expansion. Furthermore, the company signed a US distribution partnership with PepsiCo in October 2022, which is bringing the product into new points of distribution while also improving its penetration across existing points of presence. The end result should be better product availability, increasing brand awareness, higher sales volumes and scale-driven margin improvements.”\n\n6. Coterra Energy Inc (NYSE:CTRA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 42\n\nAnswering a question about oilfield services company Schlumberger, Cramer said that the company \"did not deliver.\" Cramer said he feels \"terrible\" about the stock. However, Cramer reminded investors that he likes Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) and his charitable trust also owns a position in the company.\n\nCoterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) stock has gained about 10% so far this year.\n\nLike Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cramer is also bullish on CTRA.\n\nDiamond Hill Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other bottom contributors in Q4 included Coterra Energy Inc. (NYSE:CTRA), VF Corporation and Ciena Corporation. Coterra Energy is an oil exploration and production company focused in West Texas’s Permian Basin and Oklahoma. Though production is beating expectations, shares traded in sympathy with the broader industry, which declined alongside falling oil and natural gas prices.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Recommending These 5 Stocks Heading Into May 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "3 Autonomous Driving Stocks with the Potential to Make You an Overnight Millionaire",
        "content": "Self-driving cars are hitting the roads, creating a big opportunity for autonomous driving stocks.\n\nMercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGYY) just became the first automaker to sell Level 3 autonomous cars in the U.S. And it doesn’t need a driver to watch the road.\n\nLevel 3 refers to different stages of driving automation. Levels 0, 1 and 2 refer to driver support features, which can steer, accelerate and brake. However, a driver must constantly supervise and take over when needed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWithLevels 3, 4 and 5, a driver is not driving when automated driving features are on. That’s even if you are in the driver’s seat. With Level 3, though, when requested by the features, you have to take control of the car. With Levels 4 and 5, automated driving features will not require you to take over, as noted by SAE International.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) isn’t at a Level 3 is because, according to The Verge, its self-driving cars have been linked to hundreds of crashes and deaths. As noted by CNBC, “Tesla’s Autopilot design has ‘led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,’ the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report said. The system did not “sufficiently ensure driver attention and appropriate use.”\n\nMeanwhile, it was just reported that a self-driving Waymo taxi was seen driving down the wrong side of the road.\n\nWhile Waymo and Tesla still have a lot of work to do, Mercedes-Benz seems to be off to a good start, which could help fuel upside potential for other autonomous driving stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the tech sector is a big part of the autonomous driving boom.\n\nAccording to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CFO Collette Kress, “nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with Nvidia,” as quoted by QZ.com.\n\nNvidia is also working with hundreds of auto companies, including carmakers, truck makers and robotaxis. That includes Mercedes, Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF). Even Tesla was a big client in 2023, buying H100 GPUs.\n\nGranted, NVDA is an $877 stock at the moment but it’s still a bargain. Some analysts say it could fly well above $1,000 near term. Loop Capital, for example, says NVDA could test $1,200, noting that company earnings will significantly beat estimates this year. The firm also has a buy rating on the stock. Even Oppenheimer analysts raised their price target to $850, citing growth from its data center revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nEvery pullback in NVDA is a buying opportunity.\n\nAmbarella (AMBA) Autonomous Driving Stocks, A finger hovering over an \"autonomous drive\" button.\n\nSource: Olivier Le Moal / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at beaten-down, oversold shares of Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), another one of the top autonomous driving stocks.\n\nAfter dropping on earnings, the stock is now oversold and is attempting to pivot higher. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Better, if you look at a two-year chart of AMBA, you’ll see that each time those three indicators align in oversold territory. And just as they’re doing now, the stock tends to bounce back. It’s happened about eight times since 2022.\n\nWith negativity now priced into AMBA stock, I’d like to see it retest $65 again near term. Helping, the company just announced a strategic deal focused on advanced mobility systems.\n\nAs noted in a recent press release, SANY Group “agreed to leverage Ambarella’s powerful CV3-AD family of automotive AI domain controller systems-on-chip (SoCs) to develop advanced automated driving solutions, and to achieve technical validation and deployment on its next-gen commercial vehicles and special-purpose vehicles.”\n\nKodiak Robotics also noted that itsnext-generation self-driving truck platform will use Ambarella’s CV3-AD685 SoC to “provide a high-performance compute solution in the smallest form factor, which enables Kodiak’s modular autonomous vehicle platform hardware across a wide variety of environmental conditions,” as noted in an AMBA press release.\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) A young woman reads a book while behind the wheel of a self-driving car.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want greater exposure autonomous and electric vehicle (EV) stocks at less cost, look at the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials. Some of its top holdings include Nvidia, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to name a few.\n\nAt less than $24 a share, the DRIV ETF has been trending higher since bottoming out at around $23 a share. From its current price of $23.27, I’d like to see it retest $27.50 near term. What’s nice about the ETF is that I can buy 100 shares of it for about $2,327. Meanwhile, if I were to buy 100 shares of just one of its holdings, such as TSLA, it would cost me close to $16,830.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Could Make You a Fortune (If You Dare)",
        "content": "From the working class anticipating joblessness to the financial analysts predicting a market takeover by artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, the algorithmic revolution has been historic. AI tech has seen such explosive growth that some financial analysts might tell you that you are already too late to benefit from investing in AI stocks.\n\nDon’t panic though, the views regarding AI’s application and usefulness are still polarized, and many technology companies have very recently jumped into this new space. So, if you are someone who believes sometimes riskier investments can do wonders in terms of making significant wealth, then here are the three AI stocks that could make you a fortune.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a multinational company specializing in manufacturing and selling of consumer technology products. As of April 2024, Apple is the second-largest company in the world according to its market cap valuation of $2.61 rillion. The stock price has experienced a downward spiral in the past year. However, Yahoo Finance analysts have an average one-year price target of around $199, which is 17.62% higher than the current trading value of $169.30.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere is no denying that Apple’s past year has not been great in terms of its performance in the market, primarily owing to the decreasing demand for iPhones. However, Apple’s backfooting in the AI realm has kept investors confused. But that’s over now as Apple finally sets to unveil its artificial intelligence system named ReALM, which is said to be more powerful than the OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nThe stock lost around 15% of its value in the past four months, but the company anticipates a strong recovery with the launch of its language processing model along with the release of the new iOS 18. On the brighter side, the stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which makes the stock further stand out ahead of a potential AI-tech drop.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA (NVDA) logo on wall\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is currently the largest chip and graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer in the world. The chipmaker really surprised the industry by showing off a massive 223% stock price growth within the past year. However, the more surprising fact is the current price sits closer to the lower valuation of $478.40 as compared to the highest valuation of $2,762. This means there is likely ample room upwards.\n\nBeing the backbone of any hardcore computer processing power, the manufacturer has quite strategically positioned itself where a lot of AI propagation is dependent on its hardware and software components. Moreover, the recent acquisition of Israel-based Run:ai places the chipmaker at the forefront of the artificial intelligence race.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if the future of the company is not certain in the AI realm itself, the company has earned analysts’ trust. For the past two months, the stock has been among the strongest buying recommendations. Rightly so, with the stock trading at only 36x forward earnings, and a massive growth estimate of over 450%. Thus, it puts this AI stock among investor favorites.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor and chip manufacturer founded back in 1961. It is one of those companies that only a few investors knew about but recently caught attention as the company aims to outshine its largest rival in the ongoing AI revolution. As of now, the average price target sits at $1,522, which is already over 13% higher than the current valuation of $1344.\n\nBroadcom is quite a reputable company when it comes to the manufacturing of mobile phone chipsets. AI scalability and further expansion are highly dependent on the efficiency of the hardware, and that’s where Broadcom is establishing its footing. With the mantra “Open, Scalable, Power Efficient”, the chipmaker is focused on enabling consumer AI.\n\nDue to growing demand for AI, the silicon merchant estimates 35% of total revenue, or $10 billion, comes from AI products. The chipmaker enjoyed massive share price growth of 135% in the past year with earnings per share growing over 25%. The stock trades at just 28x forward earnings. Given its huge successes, AVGO stock should be a hot pick for investors wanting exposure in the AI realm.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon.com may be feeling pressure to join the dividend club",
        "content": "By Lewis Krauskopf\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - E-commerce titan Amazon.com may be under increasing pressure to offer investors a dividend, as it now finds itself one of the few massive U.S. technology and growth companies not making regular payouts to shareholders.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet last week became the latest of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of market heavyweights to start paying a dividend, after Meta Platforms declared one in February. The announcements were followed by big post-earnings gains in the shares of both companies, though they were far from the only factor.\n\nThat has left Amazon and Tesla as the only companies in the group that do not pay a dividend. Microsoft's payouts date back some 20 years, while Apple and Nvidia have been paying dividends for over a decade.\n\nAmazon will report quarterly results and hold a conference call with analysts after the market closes on Tuesday, in the midst an earnings season that has produced mixed reactions to results by Big Tech companies.\n\n“It certainly puts the spotlight on (Amazon) because now they’re really the last one standing in terms of Big Tech not paying a dividend,” said Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research.\n\n“Dividends are representations of earnings power. So the fact that the rest of Big Tech has now decided to be able to exhibit earnings power and growth in earnings power with a dividend, that leaves them very much isolated versus the rest of the group,” Colas said.\n\nDavid Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors, said the dividend decisions by Amazon's peer group could have some influence.\n\n\"They could reasonably say, 'OK, the bigger players like Google, like Meta, have instated a dividend, we can do that as well,'\" said Katz, whose firm owns shares of both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nWhile corporate profits are ultimately seen as a far more important driver of a company’s share price, dividends could increase a stock’s shareholder base - though they may take time to do so.\n\nAbout $1 trillion was invested in dividend funds as of September, according to Morningstar. However, megacaps such as Meta and Alphabet may be off-limits to many of them, for now.\n\nMany funds look for stocks that have dividend yields far higher than those offered by dividend-paying members of the Magnificent Seven, said Daniel Sotiroff, senior analyst at Morningstar Research Services. A yield is the dividend paid per share as a percentage of the current share price.\n\nMeta shares, for example, currently yield 0.45% while Alphabet yields 0.47%. That is below the 1.44% yield of the overall S&P 500, and well below the yields of stocks such as Pfizer and 3M, which are both over 6%, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmong other Magnificent Seven members, Microsoft yields 0.74%, Apple yields 0.57% and Nvidia, whose shares are up 77% so far this year, yields a paltry 0.02%.\n\nOther funds focus on companies that have consistently increased their dividends over time, and companies such as Meta and Alphabet lack such track records as new initiators.\n\nApple, however, was last year added to the popular Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, Sotiroff said. The exchange-traded fund owned some $3.45 billion of the company’s shares as of the end of March, its second-biggest holding.\n\nOn the other hand, actively managed funds not bound by such restrictions could more immediately hop on board the shares of a company that just announced a dividend, Sotiroff said.\n\nOr, \"it might be individual investors that like it now because it is making a payout,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wells Fargo and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – April 30, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wells Fargo & Company WFC as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global Holdings HTZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Apple AAPL, Lenovo LNVGY and HP HPQ.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #1 Wells Fargo & Company is one of the largest financial services companies in the United States, with nearly $2 trillion in assets as of April 2024. The San Francisco-based Wells Fargo specializes in banking, insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage services, and consumer and commercial finance through over 4,000 retail bank branches. Wells Fargo has an extensive automated telling machines (ATMs) network, coupled with its website and other distribution channels across North America and the globe.\n\nPositive EPS Surprise History\n\nThe banking sector has been uncertain, to say the least. A little more than a year ago Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) completely collapsed amidst soaring interest rates and a downturn in the tech sector. The collapse of SVB sparked a banking crisis, leading to collapses in other banks, such as First Citizens Bank, the 30th-largest bank in the U.S. in terms of assets at the time of its collapse.\n\nHowever, investors looking at Wells Fargo’s EPS surprise history in a vacuum would be hard-pressed to notice any banking turmoil. Over the past 15 quarters, WFC has delivered EPS that eclipsed Zacks Consensus Estimates in all but one quarter.\n\nStrong Balance Sheet\n\nWFC’s cash and cash equivalents are reaching new heights this year.\n\n1. The company is growing its deposit base recently as retail clients move away from smaller, more risk prone regional banks, back to more traditional banking juggernauts like WFC.\n\n2. WFC has been prudent in its expense management initiatives to support its financials.\n\n3. Wells has a strong liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 126% as of the first-quarter 2024, which is well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\nRelative Strength & Base Breakout\n\nDespite turmoil in the financial sector, WFC is dramatically outperforming the S&P 500 Index over the past year, gaining 53.6% compared to the S&P’s 25.5%. As I always like to teach, strength begets strength on Wall Street.\n\nWFC shares are breaking out of a two-year-long base structure on the weekly timeframe. As the old Wall Street adage goes, “The longer the base, the higher in space.” If the saying is true, WFC shares have a lot of meat left on the bone.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nDespite the turmoil in the financial sector, Wells Fargo has been a rock. The company’s stability, robust balance sheet, and relative strength foreshadow an attractive investment over the next 6-12 months.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Hertz Global Holdings is one of the largest and most well-known global car rental brands. Hertz predominantly offers short-term vehicle rental services to individuals and businesses through the Hertz brand and other brands under the Hertz “umbrella” such as Dollar Rent-A-Car, Firefly Car Rental, and Thrifty Car Rental.\n\nCompetition is Heating Up in the Short-Term\n\nWith the advent of smartphones and other modern luxuries, it is becoming increasingly more apparent that the modern consumer is looking for speed and convenience in all aspects of life. For example, when a traveler lands at an airport in a city that isn’t their own, they are more often opting for ride-sharing services than waiting in long lines and paying sky-high prices for short-term rental services like Hertz.\n\nInvestors don’t have to look far for evidence of this momentous trend. While HTZ is in the process of printing its third consecutive year of slower annual earnings-per-share (EPS) growth, ride-sharing providers are experiencing higher earnings growth.\n\nMeanwhile, new, innovative entrants such as Turo are upending the short-term vehicle rental market. Turo is becoming the Airbnb (ABNB) of vehicle rentals. The company allows clients to “skip the car rental counter and rent anything from daily drivers to pick up trucks, from trusted, local hosts on the Turo car rental marketplace.”\n\nRobotaxis are a Long-Term Threat\n\nImagine a world where a driverless car can be summoned within minutes, allowing passengers to get from point A to point B safer than ever before. Investors may not have to imagine this world for much longer. Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo and Tesla (TSLA) are going “all in” on the idea. In fact, in Tesla’s recent earnings call, CEO Elon Musk underscored the importance of autonomy and robotaxis for the company by stating, “If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company. We will, and we are.”\n\nThough robotaxis may seem like a pipe dream, they are closer than most investors probably anticipate. In fact, robotaxis are live in several U.S. cities already. Also, TSLA is jumping today on news that the company’s FSD will go live in China in the near future as well.\n\nRelative Weakness + Opportunity Cost\n\nHertz has underperformed the general market dramatically over the past year, dropping 70.9% versus the S&P 500’s 25.5% gain. Studies show that 75% of stocks follow the market’s direction. Because HTZ is one of the few stocks dropping precipitously and underperforming, it raises a red flag for investors.\n\nBeyond the problematic price action, options traders seem to believe there is much further to drop. Over the past few weeks, options traders have plunked down millions in bearish bets against the troubled company.\n\nBottom Line\n\nHertz faces several bearish headwinds, such as an antiquated service, more competition, slowing growth, and relative weakness. For these reasons, HTZ is to be avoided for the foreseeable future.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nShould You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stocks Ahead of Q2 Earnings?\n\nApple is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.\n\nHowever, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\niPhone Sales Likely to Decline in Fiscal Q2\n\nApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.\n\nThe company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOur model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.\n\nPer the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.\n\nHowever, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.\n\nServices Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q2\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.\n\nServices like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.\n\nOur estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nMac Sales Expected to Fall\n\nThe PC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo topped the shipment list, trailed by HP in terms of market share.\n\nLenovo, HP and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.\n\nNevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.\n\nHowever, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Listed in descending order by market cap, as of the closing bell on April 26, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nAside from all seven of these companies crushing the S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade, their lure, from an investment standpoint, is their competitive advantages and/or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging the old with the new. Windows is still the world's leading operating system for desktops, while Azure is the global No. 2 cloud-infrastructure service platform. Apple's calling card to success has long been its iPhone, which accounts for more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to make up in the neighborhood of 90% of the GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet's Google comprised more than 91% of global internet-search share in March, while streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world. Amazon's online marketplace is No. 1 in the U.S., with an estimated 37.6% of domestic online retail share in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading cloud-infrastructure service platform. Meta Platforms owns the top social media sites globally, including Facebook, which attract more than 3.2 billion daily active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure play EV maker that's generating a recurring profit.\n\nBut there's a new draw to the Magnificent Seven that didn't exist when 2024 began: Most of these companies now pay a dividend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFive of the Magnificent Seven stocks pay a regular dividend to their shareholders\n\nWhen most investors think of the Magnificent Seven, they probably envision Wall Street's steadiest growth stocks. With these businesses aggressively reinvesting their operating cash flow into high-growth segments and innovations, collecting dividend income is likely an afterthought.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, operating cash flow has been so robust for most of these companies that paying a regular dividend can be done without hampering their innovative capacity in any way.\n\nEntering 2024, three Magnificent Seven constituents had been paying a dividend to their shareholders for years.\n\nMicrosoft has been paying a continuous quarterly dividend since September 2004 and has seen its payout grow by more than 800% since its dividend program was first initiated. Apple reinstated its quarterly-dividend program in the summer of 2012 and has increased its payout by 154% in under 12 years. Nvidia has paid what currently amounts to a token dividend ($0.04 per quarter) dating back to the summer of 2013.\n\nIn February, Meta Platforms joined the party when its board introduced a $0.50 per-quarter distribution. Even with aggressive investments in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality devices, and the metaverse, Meta closed out the March quarter with $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated over $19.2 billion in net cash from its operations during the quarter. It has the balance sheet and capital to support a continuous payout to its shareholders.\n\nLast week, Alphabet became the newest member of the club. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and now-profitable cloud-infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, initiated a $0.20 per-quarter dividend. Alphabet ended March with over $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated an astounding $28.8 billion in net cash from operations in the first three months of the new year. It can easily absorb this annual payout while fueling its cloud and AI-driven ambitions.\n\nLater today, Tuesday, April 30, a sixth member of the Magnificent Seven has an opportunity to join the club.\n\nIs this the newest dividend-paying Magnificent Seven stock?\n\nLast week, Tesla's operating results made it plainly evident that it won't be doling out a dividend anytime soon to its shareholders. Tesla endured a free-cash outflow of $2.53 billion during the first quarter, with EV competition heating up and multiple rounds of price cuts wrecking the company's operating margin. Selling a commoditized product in a cyclical industry might make it difficult for Tesla to ever pay a dividend.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven component that could become the newest dividend paying stock in mere hours is Amazon -- the company is slated to report its first-quarter operating results after the closing bell today.\n\nWith Amazon stock trading at a multiple of 62 times trailing-12-month earnings, you might be quick to dismiss the likelihood of the company doling out a dividend to its shareholders. However, Amazon's balance sheet, and its three ancillary operating segments that are bona fide cash machines, suggest it can become the next income stock.\n\nWhen the curtain closed on 2023, Amazon was sitting on a treasure chest of nearly $86.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. More importantly, net cash provided by operating activities soared to nearly $85 billion in 2023 from $46.8 billion in the previous year. By 2027, Amazon's three higher-margin ancillary segments -- AWS, advertising services, and subscription services -- are expected to more than double the company's 2023 operating cash flow.\n\nAlthough advertising can be cyclical, Amazon's operating cash flow is fairly insulated against downturns in the U.S. and global economy. While e-commerce generates most of its revenue, the online marketplace is a low-margin segment. The predictability of subscription-services revenue, coupled with enterprise cloud spending still being early in its ramp, all but ensures that Amazon will have more capital than it'll know what to do with.\n\nDon't overlook peer pressure as a catalyst, either. With Meta and Alphabet introducing a dividend over the last three months, Amazon may have little choice but to follow suit in order to maintain its seat at the table among America's most-influential businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Bernstein upgraded Apple's stock to \"outperform\".\n\nOther megacap stocks finished lower including Alphabet , Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Nvidia closed higher after paring early losses.\n\nNine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors ended higher led by stocks in consumer discretionary, utilities, real estates, materials and industrials. Equities in communication services and financials were the biggest losers.\n\n\"The bigger question than rates, because they're not going to cut this week, is how hawkish they're going to speak because they've already been pretty hawkish,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital in New York.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in about 35 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the beginning of the year, according to LSEG.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 146.43 points, or 0.38%, to 38,386.09, the S&P 500 gained 16.21 points, or 0.32%, to 5,116.17 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 55.18 points, or 0.35%, to 15,983.08.\n\nShares of Domino's Pizza jumped 5.6% after topping expectations for first-quarter same-store sales. Of the 233 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings, 78.1% surpassed analyst expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data.\n\nParamount Global gained 2.9% after a report that the Redstone family and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison have made concessions to make a potential change in control of the streaming firm more appealing for other investors.\n\n\"The overall momentum is still to the upside and it's an important week, with a ton of earnings, the Fed on Wednesday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday, and the path of least resistance is higher,\" said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese yen jumped against the dollar on Monday, with traders citing yen-buying intervention by authorities trying to support a currency languishing at levels last seen over three decades ago.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.72-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,615 stocks rose and 1,604 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.63-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 69 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 9.98 billion shares, compared with the 11 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

        "content": "At one point Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was in official correction territory. Shares were down more than 20% on fears of a slowing artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not that the fears had any basis in fact. It was only because Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) failed to provide preliminary financial results when announcing its earnings release date that caused the stock to slide.\n\nIt indicated that investors were worried about Nvidia’s valuation. Having come so far so fast, the chipmaker was trading at nosebleed valuations. At such times, any sort of tremor in the marketplace can shake an overvalued stock’s foundation’s.\n\nAlthough Nvidia stock has mostly bounced back, up about 13%, it still has a ways to go before reaching a new, all-time high. Also, it means investors might bail on it again at a moment’s notice. You may want to protect your downside by seeking out new AI stocks to grab now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause the chipmaker’s stock still carries lofty valuations, consider the three stocks below to make a windfall.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMost investors know Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as a premier chip stock for mobile handsets. But few realize that QCOM is an AI beast. Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip released last year powers the AI capabilities on Android phones like Samsung‘s Galaxy S24 series and smartphones from China’s OnePlus and Xiaomi.\n\nAlso, the Snapdragon chip can support dozens of generative AI models. Those include Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Gemini. That suggests the chip can also make its way into lower cost phones and introduce the language models into their phones. We know Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to use Gemini in its next iteration of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s doubtful Qualcomm can achieve the same market valuation as Nvidia, if for no other reason than the growth trajectories of the various markets they target. However, as AI trickles down throughout technology ecosystems, more and varied uses for Qualcomm’s chips will become apparent. And because QCOM stock offers investors a better stock valuation than its rival, investors will reap a windfall grabbing its shares now.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nData centers are going to be a major component for the next phase of AI growth. Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) should be a prime beneficiary. Hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are relying upon data centers for their cloud computing services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Arista Networks makes the servers, routers, switches and network operating software data centers rely upon. The stock took a big hit earlier this month after an analyst said it would face increased competition from Nvidia. Not usually considered a rival, Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox several years ago positions it to enter the market.\n\nYet, Arista Networks counts all major hyperscalers as customers, primarily Meta and Microsoft, both seeking ways to become less reliant upon Nvidia. And Meta’s recent earnings proclamation that it plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion on AI should see a lot of that money fall to Arista Networks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe last stock investors should consider running off with for windfall profits is ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML). The Netherlands-based manufacturer of specialized chip equipment is a literal monopoly on certain high-end machines needed for producing AI chips.\n\nASML is the world’s only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung are all customers buying the equipment to produce the advanced AI chips customers need. TSM, of course, is the world’s biggest foundry and counts Nvidia as a major customer.\n\nThe equipment manufacturer anticipates demand growing through 2025. And this year will be the first time ever ASML pre-builds its inventory in anticipation of future orders. Having supply on hand will shorten lead time and improve efficiency. If AI is going to grow, it is going to need ASML’s equipment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It’s another busy slate of earnings this week, with a wide variety of companies on the reporting docket. We’ve gotten through the big banks’ results and a few quarterly releases from ‘Mag 7’ members, whose results didn’t cause any meaningful spooks.\n\nAnd concerning this week’s docket, investor favorite Apple AAPL is slated to unveil quarterly results. Shares have been considerably weak year-to-date, losing roughly 10% compared to the S&P 500’s 8% gain. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs the stock a buy heading into earnings? Let’s examine expectations and a few key metrics to watch in the release.\n\nApple\n\nApple’s woes in 2024 have primarily been fueled by fears concerning slowing growth and weakening demand from China, with its quiet-natured approach to artificial intelligence (AI) also causing some head-scratching.\n\nShares faced pressure post-earnings following its latest release, with positivity surrounding its Services portfolio unable to excite the market. It’s worth noting that revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion throughout the quarter, down 13% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in China stands at $16.6 billion, suggesting a 6.7% decrease from the year-ago period. As shown below, AAPL’s China revenue has fallen short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases, with the most recent miss totaling $2.5 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning the Services portfolio, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $23.3 billion, 11.5% higher than the $20.9 billion reported in the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our Services expectations but modestly fell short in its latest release. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOf course, iPhone results will also be in focus. Our consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $46.2 billion, reflecting a nearly 10% pullback from the year-ago mark of $51.3 billion. The company snapped a streak of negative iPhone surprises in its latest release, with the beat totaling roughly $1 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have modestly lowered their earnings expectations since the beginning of February, with the $1.51 per share estimate down 2.6% and essentially flat compared to the year-ago figure. Revenue revisions have moved in a similar fashion, as the $90 billion expected is down the same amount over the same period.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWe have many investor favorites on the reporting docket for this week, a list that includes tech heavyweight Apple AAPL.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will be tuned into the company’s China results, which have recently faced pressure amid rising competition. The Services portfolio will undoubtedly be another major highlight, an area of the company that’s been a solid growth driver recently.\n\nHeading into the release, Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 fastest growing cities in California. If you want to skip our discussion on the economy of the state, you can go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Cities in California.\n\nCalifornia, the third largest state in the US by size, is known for its diverse population. The state ranks second only to Hawaii in the United States Census Bureau’s Diversity Index by State for 2020. Furthermore, California holds the title of the most populous state in the US and the eleventh most densely populated state. California is also home to Los Angeles, the second largest city in the US, as well as San Diego and San Jose, which are among the top 12 largest US cities by population.\n\nCalifornia is a bustling hub for business, with around 53 Fortune 500 companies. It holds the third position, following New York and Texas, in terms of the highest number of Fortune 500 companies. The state recorded a nominal GDP of $3.9 trillion in 2023. California’s economy is supported by over 1.7 million private-sector businesses as of 2022. These businesses contribute significantly, generating 90% of the state's economic output and creating around 15.6 million jobs.\n\nSilicon Valley, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, is known as the country’s technology hub. In 2023, the 20 largest tech companies in the Bay Area saw a reduction of approximately 7% in the region's workforce, amounting to roughly 18,800 workers. However, despite this decrease, by the end of the year, there was a net increase of about 37,000 individuals employed by technology firms in the Bay Area compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAnother measure of the region's well-being is its population dynamics. Silicon Valley experienced a decline in net migration starting in 2015. However, between mid-2022 and mid-2023, the area recorded a net increase of around 1,800 individuals, with more people coming in than leaving. This shift was due to a 52% decrease in the net number of individuals moving away, coupled with a roughly 37% increase in the number of foreign immigrants.\n\nSome of the prominent companies headquartered in California include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB).\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), based in Cupertino, is known for designing, developing, and retailing consumer electronics. The company is currently restructuring its supply chain to minimize emissions and its environmental impact. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) global operations are now powered by over 18 gigawatts of clean electricity. This reflects more than three times the amount recorded in 2020. Furthermore, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to restore 100 percent of the freshwater utilized in corporate operations, particularly in areas facing high water stress, by 2030. To achieve this goal, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has established partnerships to provide around 7 billion gallons of water benefits over the next two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB), formerly known as Trimble Navigation, specializes in producing cutting-edge products used in unmanned defense systems, mapping, machine controls, asset tracking, and mining. One of the company’s flagship offerings is Trimble Connect, which is a cloud-based collaboration platform. It is widely used by people in the design and construction sectors. Trimble Connect offers clients’ data security and facilitates real-time updates across the entire process chain. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) had approximately 12,700 employees as of 2023.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was established in 1968. Based in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley, the company is known as one of the world's largest manufacturers of central processing units (CPUs) and semiconductors. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) recently introduced its newest AI chip, the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. The company has positioned the chip as superior to Nvidia's H100. As of 2023, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) employed a workforce of 124,800 individuals.\n\nHere’s what Ariel Investments said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“New holding, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturers by revenue, outperformed in the quarter. Intel is benefitting from the near-term rebound in semiconductor demand driven by the cyclical recovery of personal computers (PCs) and central processing units (CPUs). Shares also traded higher following the company’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Everywhere launch event. Intel introduced its capabilities across cloud, edge and client hardware and showcased it can benefit from an enterprise upgrade cycle as both cloud-based and traditional enterprises look to incorporate AI features into core technology platforms. In our view, the market is also overlooking the progress Intel has made towards regaining its manufacturing technology advantage and believe the foundry business will continue to experience strong momentum as it grows its customer base and revenue.” 15 Fastest Growing Cities in California\n\nAerial view of a residential neighborhood in a metropolitan area in California.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the fastest growing cities in California, we used data from the US Census Bureau.

        "content": "By Sinéad Carew\n\n(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc were up 3% on Monday after a well-known analyst at Bernstein Societe Generale Group upgraded the stock to an \"outperform\" rating, pointing to the prospects for phone replacement phone sales with help from generative artificial intelligence updates.\n\nApple was on track for its biggest one-day gain in roughly two weeks. Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi wrote that Apple had been hurt by a weak iPhone 15 cycle as well as fears that its China business is structurally impaired.\n\nBut the analyst argued that China weakness is \"more cyclical than structural\" and that its business there has \"exhibited much higher volatility\" than Apple's overall business.\n\nAnd Sacconaghi wrote that \"replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\"\n\nLooking to 2025, he is estimating that the company could report $416.9 billion in revenue and $7.40 earnings per share, which would beat consensus expectations for revenue of $412.1 billion and $7.13 EPS. He also said iPhone unit sales could grow 10% year-over-year to 248 million.\n\nAnd while Sacconaghi said that expectations are low for Apple's fiscal second quarter results, due out on Thursday, he noted the stock is \"entering its seasonally strong trading period\" as it has outperformed in the three months before its iPhone launches in 15 of the last 17 years.\n\nSacconaghi kept his price target of $195, which compares with Apple's last trading price of $174.43 on Monday.\n\nApple shares were last down more than 9% year-to-date after rising 48% in 2023.\n\n(Reporting by Sinéad Carew; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nView comments",

Bernstein upgraded Apple's stock to \"outperform\".\n\nOther megacap stocks were trading lower. Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Microsoft, were down between 0.3% and 3.2%.\n\nNine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher led by stocks in consumer discretionary, utilities, real estates, materials and industrials.\n\n\"The bigger question than rates, because they're not going to cut this week, is how hawkish they're going to speak because they've already been pretty hawkish,\" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at hedge fund Great Hill Capital in New York.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in about 35 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the beginning of the year, according to LSEG.\n\nAt 2:48 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 113.70 points, or 0.30%, to 38,353.36, the S&P 500 gained 10.10 points, or 0.19%, to 5,109.84 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 39.69 points, or 0.25%, to 15,967.59.\n\nDomino's Pizza jumped nearly 5% after topping expectations for first-quarter same-store sales. Of the 233 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings, 78.1% surpassed analyst expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data.\n\nParamount Global gained 3.5% after a report that the Redstone family and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison have made concessions to make a potential change in control of the streaming firm more appealing for other investors.\n\n\"The overall momentum is still to the upside and it's an important week, with a ton of earnings, the Fed on Wednesday and nonfarm payrolls on Friday, and the path of least resistance is higher,\" said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese yen\n\njumped\n\nagainst the dollar on Monday, with traders citing yen-buying intervention by authorities trying to support a currency languishing at levels last seen over three decades ago\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.8-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, 2,640 stocks rose and 1,514 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.74-to-1 ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq recorded 70 new highs and 55 new lows.

        "title": "What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?",
        "content": "What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), now the world’s second most valuable company, has had a challenging year so far in 2024. The tech giant has lost significant market share in China to domestic rival Huawei, and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) recently filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against the iPhone maker, accusing it of creating a monopoly over the smartphone market and engaging in anti-competitive practices. To make matters worse, Apple announced earlier this month that it would lay off 614 employees in California, according to eight reports filed with the California Employment Development Department.\n\nThese developments have led some investors to question the stability of their investments in Apple, particularly in light of the fact that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) sold nearly $2 billion worth of its Apple shares during the 4th quarter of 2023. This begs the question: What would happen if Warren Buffett decided to completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple?\n\nIt’s important to note that there is no indication that Buffett plans to sell any of Berkshire’s Apple shares, let alone all of them. In fact, during the company’s annual shareholders meeting last year, Buffett praised Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” However, for the sake of speculation, let’s explore the potential impact of such a move.\n\nAs of the latest filings, Berkshire Hathaway owns 905,560,000 shares of Apple, representing a significant portion of the tech company’s 15.44 billion outstanding shares. If Buffett were to sell all of these shares, it could potentially flood the market with excess supply, putting downward pressure on Apple’s stock price.\n\nGiven that Apple’s average daily trading volume is around 61.6 million shares, it would take approximately 15 trading days for the market to absorb Berkshire’s entire stake, assuming no other factors influenced the stock’s trading activity. During this hypothetical sell-off, Apple’s shares, which are already down 9.3% year-to-date, could experience further decline.\n\nThe psychological impact of Buffett’s complete divestment could also be significant. Many investors look to Buffett as a beacon of long-term, value-oriented investing. If he were to lose faith in Apple, it could shake investor confidence and lead to a broader sell-off in the stock.\n\nHowever, it’s crucial to remember that Apple is still a fundamentally strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. Despite the challenges it faces, analysts remain bullish on the stock, with a consensus price target of $196.77, representing a potential 17.51% upside from current levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe truth is, no matter how strong a company may be, factors beyond its control – such as market sentiment, regulatory pressures, and competition – can significantly impact its stock price. This underscores the importance of diversification in an investor’s portfolio.\n\nDiversifying Beyond the Stock Market\n\nFor investors seeking to mitigate the risks associated with stock market volatility, alternative investments like real estate can provide a valuable diversification opportunity. Platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer unique ways to invest in real estate without the need to purchase and manage properties directly.\n\nArrived allows investors to buy shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing exposure to the potential appreciation and rental income of the underlying properties. With an average dividend yield of 4.2% and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\nClick here to see properties available to invest in today with as little as $100\n\nSimilarly, Cityfunds provides a way for investors to gain exposure to specific real estate markets through its city-specific funds. For example, you could own shares of a diversified portfolio of home equity investments in Miami, which have already seen a 14.7% increase in value.\n\nThere's also the Cityfunds Yield fund, which targets an 8% annual yield, with a guaranteed 7% floor, by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.\n\nClick here to explore the Cityfunds available to invest in today with as little as $500.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWhile it’s unlikely that Warren Buffett will completely divest Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Apple, the hypothetical scenario serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in any single stock investment. By diversifying into alternative assets like real estate, investors can potentially reduce their exposure to market volatility and build a more resilient portfolio.\n\nAs always, investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. But for those looking to expand their investment horizons, platforms like Arrived and Cityfunds offer compelling opportunities to invest in real estate without the headaches of traditional property ownership.\n\nThis article What Would Happen If Warren Buffett Bailed On Apple And Sold All Of Berkshire Hathaway's Shares? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple (AAPL) Stock Ahead of Q2 Earnings?",
        "content": "Apple AAPL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 2.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $89.99 billion, indicating a decline of 5.11% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.51 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days. However, the figure indicates a 0.66% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nApple has been one of the top performers in the past 12 months with consistent earnings performance. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.20% on average.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple has been suffering from lower demand for the iPhone, a weak China market, stiff competition in the smartphone market and a worsening regulatory environment. These factors have hurt share price movement, which has declined 12.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\niPhone Sales Likely to Decline in Fiscal Q2\n\nApple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 58.3% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales increased 6% year over year to $69.7 billion.\r\n\r\nThe company expects the March quarter’s (second-quarter fiscal 2024) iPhone revenues to be like that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nOur model estimates for fiscal second-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $46.99 billion, suggesting an 8.5% decline year over year. Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 53.3 million iPhones in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.\r\n\r\nPer the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 16% in the first quarter of calendar 2024, trailing Samsung’s 20%.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s reported plan to integrate Gemini, Google’s generative AI service, into iOS can be a gamechanger for iPhone shipments.\n\nServices Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q2\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.\r\n\r\nServices like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.\r\n\r\nOur estimate for fiscal second-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $23.07 billion, indicating 10.3% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMac Sales Expected to Fall\n\nPC segment witnessed growth in the first quarter of calendar 2024 after two years of decline. Per IDC’s latest report, 59.8 million PCs were shipped, up 1.5% from the year-ago period. Lenovo LNVGY topped the shipment list, trailed by HP HPQ and Dell Technologies DELL, in terms of market share.\r\n\r\nLenovo, HP, Dell and Apple had 23%, 20.1%, 15.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Moreover, in terms of shipment, Lenovo and HP witnessed growth of 7.8% and 0.2%, respectively, while Dell Technologies lost 2.2%. Apple witnessed 14.6% growth, the strongest on the list.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mac sales are expected to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for fiscal second-quarter Mac net sales is pegged at $6.03 billion, indicating a 15.9% year-over-year decline.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weak iPhone and Mac sales as well as weakness in China. Regulatory headwind, including the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit, is expected to remain an overhang on the shares.\r\n\r\nHowever, we believe the dip in Apple’s share price presents a buying opportunity, and it would be wise to buy ahead of the second-quarter fiscal earnings. Integration of AI into iPhone, solid Apple TV+ content, expanding installed base and strong Services business are key catalysts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Bernstein upgraded the stock to \"outperform\".\n\nU.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, buoyed by moderate inflation data and a rally in megacap growth stocks following robust quarterly results from technology heavyweights Alphabet and Microsoft.\n\nAlso offering support, Israel-Hamas peace talks in Cairo eased fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nFocus will now shift to the Fed's interest rate decision due on Wednesday, ahead of a key jobs report on Friday that could set the tone for market direction in the near-term.\n\n\"There are definitely some issues that are not just headline driven on inflation that investors are paying a little more attention to, and that brings back into balance things like the inflation versus safety,\" said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group.\n\nUtilities gained 1.2%, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined, last standing at 4.625%.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in just about 35 basis points (bps) of interest rate cuts this year, down from about 150 bps seen at the beginning of the year, according to LSEG.\n\nAt 11:28 a.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 85.52 points, or 0.22%, to 38,325.18, the S&P 500 gained 12.46 points, or 0.24%, to 5,112.42 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 40.16 points, or 0.25%, to 15,968.06.\n\nOffsetting the optimism, the communication services sector lost 1.7%, dragged by Alphabet and Meta Platforms shedding more than 2% each.\n\nOn the earnings front, Domino's Pizza jumped nearly 5% after topping Street expectations for first-quarter same-store sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 233 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings, 78.1% surpassed analyst expectations, compared with a long-term average of 67%, according to LSEG data.\n\nAmong other movers, Paramount Global gained 4.8% after a report that the Redstone family and Skydance Media CEO David Ellison have made concessions to make a potential change in control of the streaming firm more appealing for other investors.\n\nLower bitcoin prices weighed on cryptocurrency-linked stocks. Crypto exchange Coinbase Global and crypto miners Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital were down between 3.2% and 3.7%.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.98-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq recorded 57 new highs and 39 new lows.

        "title": "12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 under the radar stocks with massive upside for 2024. If you want to skip our overview of shareholder ownership and how shares can jump if they come 'over' the radar instead of under, then you can jump ahead to 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024.\n\nInvesting in stocks is quite different these days compared to even just a decade back. Broadband internet combined with the rapid boom in personal computing devices, digital banking, and financial technology services allows anyone willing to take the risk to try their hand at stocks. This democratization of the stock market means that as opposed to the Wall Street of the 2000s and the 1990s, now, anyone can set their trading setup, consume information, and see how fate plays out on the S&P 500.\n\nAt the same time, while there are more avenues of trading available, the number of equities that are available for trading also runs in the thousands. For our everyday retail trader, this means that some stocks will always be under the radar as sifting out small and little known companies that might be the next Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might remain out of the spotlight for retail traders. Professional investors such as hedge funds benefit from their significant computing, financial, and human resources which enable them to go through countless firms each day to see which might be poised for growth.\n\nAs a result of all this, and other factors such as management decisions, stocks can also be bifurcated along their ownership structure. Some stocks, such as the mining giant BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) or the American depository receipts of the well known Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are well known among retail investors and also have a large portion of their share ownership represented by them. Data from Refinitiv shows that for BHP, institutional and insider investors own 3.84% of the total shares outstanding, while for Toyota this percentage drops down to just 1.51%. This is unsurprising given that not only do these firms have billions of shares outstanding, but also since they are global brands.\n\nOther stocks are remarkable for their significant institutional and insider ownership. For instance, the software giant Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) has 157.36 million shares outstanding and 155.6 million shares as its float. Despite this, 92% of its stock is held by institutions, ensuring that even if the stock generates substantial hype, it will nevertheless remain under the radar as large numbers of retail investors will remain unable to add the stock to their portfolios and monitor it over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, investing in under the radar stocks can also be quite lucrative. After all, rapid share price appreciations are often driven by a large number of people feeling confident about a stock's future and starting to buy the shares. Perhaps the best example of this and one that's relevant to our discussion of Wall Street's democratization is the stock of the well known video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). Part of the meme stock craze that briefly took over the stock market, GameStop's shares soared in triple digit percentages in the blink of an eye as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the stock in bulk. This also led to massive losses for hedge funds which had sold the shares short based on the firm's fundamentals, and for a brief time period, it appeared that Wall Street had permanently changed.\n\nSo, which stocks are currently under the radar and are seeing significant upside from analysts? We took a look, with some top picks being Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA). 12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best under the radar stocks with significant upside we first made a list of under the radar stocks by sifting through coverage in the financial media. Then, the top 20 stocks with the highest analyst average share price target upside were narrowed down. Finally, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023, and the best under the radar stocks were picked.\n\nFor these top under the radar stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\n12. Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 20\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 71%\n\nConcentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is one of the biggest information technology companies in the world, with close to half a million employees. It offers analytics, customer management, and other software products and services. The firm has struggled on the financial front as of late since it has missed analyst EPS estimates in three out of its four latest quarters.\n\nAs of Q4 2023 end, 20 out of the 933 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought and owned Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC)'s shares. Lauren Taylor Wolfe's Impactive Capital was the biggest shareholder due to its $334 million stake.\n\nJust like JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is an under the radar stock with huge upside.\n\n11. Editas Medicine, Inc. (NASDAQ:EDIT)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 200%\n\nEditas Medicine, Inc. (NASDAQ:EDIT) is a biotechnology company focusing on using genetic editing to help patients. Despite the fact that it's a gene editing stock and one that has also focused on making highly lucrative treatments for Sickle Cell disease, the shares are down by 47% year to date. Editas Medicine, Inc.

        "title": "Here's How Much Stock Apple Repurchased in the Past Year",
        "content": "Most investors focus on a company's growth prospects when considering a purchase of its stock. And understandably so. Revenue and earnings growth isn't the only way to add to a stock's value, however.\n\nReducing the number of outstanding shares of a company is another, often-overlooked means of making existing shareholders' stakes worth more. The company in question simply needs to repurchase shares of itself in the open market and then take them out of circulation.\n\nApple's stock repurchases, by the numbers\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been one of the more prominent names embracing this idea. Although it pays a dividend, it's opting to reward investors by buying shares of itself rather than raising its dividend payouts. Over the course of the past four reported quarters, Apple has shelled out $78.1 billion to repurchase 456 million shares of its own stock. For perspective, Apple's current market capitalization stands at $2.6 trillion, and it's got nearly 15.58 billion outstanding shares.\n\nOK, the stock repurchase program isn't exactly making a huge dent in shareholders' favor. Keep things in perspective, though. This is an enormous company. It's going to take a lot to make a beneficial difference in its float. Given what's feasible, Apple's buyback program is actually quite impressive.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the company continues to make overall net progress in terms of reducing the supply of shares in its effort to make its remaining ones more valuable. Unlike too many other corporations, this one isn't issuing new stock just as quickly as it's repurchasing and retiring existing shares. As of the end of last year, there were about 2% fewer outstanding Apple shares than there were a year earlier.\n\nAnother bullish argument\n\nIs the company's stock buyback program a reason in and of itself to purchase Apple stock? No. The consistent net repurchases of its own shares, however, certainly bolsters the bullish argument for owning Apple stock. The thing is, even if Apple were a net issuer of new shares of itself, it would still be a great investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $537,557!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Warren Buffett's Second Biggest Holding After Apple by 2027",
        "content": "Anyone who follows Warren Buffett knows that Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest position in his Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. The technology giant currently makes up a whopping 41.2% of Berkshire's total equity investments.\n\nWhich stock ranks second? For now, it's Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). However, the big bank might not hold onto its spot for too much longer. I predict another stock will be Buffett's second biggest holding after Apple by 2027.\n\nThe current top contenders\n\nFirst, I fully expect Apple will remain at the top of the list for Berkshire for years to come. Although the conglomerate trimmed its position in Apple a little in the fourth quarter of 2023, Buffett still thinks highly of the company and its management.\n\nI don't anticipate Apple's shares dropping so much that it falls out of the No. 1 position, either. Sure, the stock is arguably overvalued considering its meager growth. However, artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a much-needed catalyst for Apple over the next few years.\n\nWhich stock could knock Bank of America out of its second-place perch? Only three other stocks currently make up more than 5% of Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nIt wouldn't be too much of a stretch for American Express to move past Bank of America. Berkshire's stake in AmEx is worth nearly $36 billion compared to $39.1 billion for BofA. I don't think Buffett will pour a lot more money into American Express. However, AmEx stock could grow faster than Bank of America over the next three years -- perhaps enough to slide into the No. 2 spot in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company and Chevron have steeper hills to climb. Berkshire owns $24.7 billion of Coca-Cola shares and $20.8 billion of Chevron. I doubt Buffett will buy more Coke stock, but he could increase his stake in Chevron (as he did in Q4). Still, it's unlikely that either stock will replace Bank of America behind Apple, in my view.\n\nWhy another stock could leapfrog into No. 2\n\nHowever, another stock could vault past Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron to become Buffett's second biggest position. I think the ingredients are in place for Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) to leapfrog these stocks.\n\nBuffett loves Oxy. He wrote to Berkshire shareholders earlier this year that he expects to own shares of the oil and gas producer \"indefinitely.\" He also praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, saying she knows \"how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMore importantly, Buffett continues to show his affection for Occidental by aggressively buying shares. He initiated a position in the stock in the first quarter of 2022. Berkshire now owns 28% of the company. The conglomerate won regulatory approval in August 2022 to acquire up to 50% of Oxy.\n\nAt the rate it's going, Berkshire could easily own half of Occidental by the end of 2027. Based on the company's current market cap, its stake would be worth roughly $30 billion. That's still well below the level needed to replace Bank of America as Berkshire's second largest holding, but I don't expect Oxy's market cap to stay at the current level.\n\nHollub predicts an oil supply shortage by late 2025. If she's right, Occidental and other oil stocks should move significantly higher. I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a boost from advances in the company's direct air capture technology either.\n\nShould you buy Oxy hand over fist?\n\nInvestors shouldn't buy Occidental stock only because I've predicted it could be Buffett's second largest holding by 2027. I've been wrong before; I could be wrong in this case.\n\nHowever, I like the prospects for oil stocks, in general, over the next few years. Occidental could be one of the industry's top performers, especially if Buffett continues to scoop up shares (which I suspect is likely).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Buying (and Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them!)",
        "content": "Since the advent of the internet three decades ago, numerous next-big-thing investment trends have come and gone. But none of these trends have offered to change the growth arc for corporate America quite like the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nAI involves using software and systems to undertake tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What makes AI special is the ability for software and systems to become smarter without human intervention over time (i.e., machine learning). Being able to evolve over time and become more proficient at their tasks gives AI-driven software and systems utility across almost every sector and industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to a report released last year by the analysts at PwC, productivity gains and consumption-side effects directly tied to AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. A figure this large is hard for investors -- and members of Congress -- to ignore.\n\nBased on data compiled by Unusual Whales in its \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report, members of Congress can't stop buying four artificial intelligence stocks. Interestingly, you won't find Nvidia on this list, despite it being a favorite of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband!\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first AI stock lawmakers have been avid buyers of is Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, among other ventures.\n\nMembers of the House and Senate purchased an aggregate of $1.49 million worth of Alphabet Class A stock (GOOGL) last year. The biggest buyers included House. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), who made numerous purchases in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, as well as House Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-NY), who added between $50,000 and $100,000 of Alphabet stock in late January 2023, based on trading activity compiled by Capitol Trades.\n\nWhat makes Alphabet such an attractive investment is its world-leading search engine. In March, Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search share. As the clear choice for advertisers, Google tends to enjoy strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates. Lengthy periods of economic growth are positive for ad-driven companies, as well.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's biggest growth driver looks to be Google Cloud. Alphabet has been busy incorporating generative AI solutions into Google Cloud to help merchants tailor ads to consumers.\n\nLast year marked the first time Google Cloud generated a full-year operating profit. With enterprise cloud spending still early in its ramp, and cloud margins running circles around advertising margins, Alphabet should see a healthy uptick in its operating cash flow over time.\n\nStory continues Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband have been active buyers of Apple stock. Image source: Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead.\n\nApple\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock that members of Congress have pounced on is tech titan Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). With the exception of oil and gas company ConocoPhillips, no stock was purchased more in 2023 by lawmakers than Apple ($2.4 million).\n\nThough Apple's future isn't as reliant on AI as the other companies on this list, voice assistant Siri is an example of it incorporating AI solutions into its iPhone for more than a decade.\n\nApple's biggest buyer in Congress last year was none other than S&P 500-outperformer Nancy Pelosi. A periodic transaction report from the former House Speaker noted a $500,000 to $1 million buy of Apple stock in March, which was followed by the purchase of $250,000 to $500,000 in additional shares in June.\n\nInnovation continues to be the driving force behind Apple's long-term outperformance. Its iPhone controls more than half of U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady evolution of Apple into a platforms company. Focusing on subscription services should lift the company's operating margin over time, as well as smooth out the revenue ebbs-and-flows that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since the start of 2013, the company's board has overseen $651 billion in buybacks.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe third AI stock that congressional traders can't stop buying is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Unusual Whales' report finds that $1.06 million in Amazon shares were purchased by lawmakers last year.\n\nThe big buyers of Amazon stock have been the aforementioned Michael McCaul and House Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA). McCaul and Khanna are the two most-active traders in Congress, with 1,826 trades and 4,253 trades, respectively, completed last year.\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because of its top-notch online marketplace, which accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. retail sales last year. However, operating margins associated with e-commerce are rather low. When it comes to cash flow generation and long-term growth potential, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's shining star.\n\nAWS is the world's top cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 31% of global share, as of September 30, 2023, per Canalys. With enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, AWS shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a double-digit growth rate and generating the bulk of Amazon's operating income.\n\nAmazon is also aggressively deploying generative AI solutions within AWS to allow its customers to build applications that can better serve their consumers.\n\nTesla\n\nA fourth AI stock that members of Congress can't stop buying is none other than North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Between the House and Senate, $840,000 in Tesla stock was purchased by lawmakers in 2023, according to Unusual Whales.\n\nThe congressional \"whale\" that was busy mashing the buy button on Tesla is Daniel Goldman. Though Goldman was active as both a seller and buyer -- behind Khanna and McCaul, he's the third most-active trader in Congress, with 1,306 trades in 2023 – his purchases of $100,000 to $250,000 of Tesla stock on March 6, 2023, as well as $15,000 to $50,000 on February 3, March 1, and April 10, stand out.\n\nThe lure for lawmakers with Tesla is its first-mover advantages in the EV space. Tesla has successfully built itself from the ground up to mass-production and delivered four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit. Tesla's EVs use cameras and sensors to assist with the split-second decision-making needed to navigate obstacles.\n\nBut among the four stocks congressional traders can't stop buying, Tesla is at the greatest risk of tumbling. Weakening demand for EVs has coerced Tesla to slash the price on Model's 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. The company has also dramatically reduced the price of its full-self driving software from what was once $15,000 to $8,000. Despite these substantial price reduction, Tesla's operating margin has nosedived from 17.2% to 5.5% over the last six quarters and its inventory levels have practically doubled.\n\nTesla's attempts to become more than a car company have fallen flat, too. Its Services segment offers a low-to-mid single-digit gross margin, while revenue growth for its once red-hot Energy Generation and Storage segment has slowed to the single digits. The once-vaunted growth story for Tesla looks to be officially dead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Selling These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul from Texas's 10th congressional district is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul was one of the leading politicians calling for a ban on TikTok.  He authored the bill against the Chinese social media company which the US Senate recently passed, calling TikTok a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" President Joe Biden has signed the bill into law that would ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance fails to divest the app within a year.\n\nCongressman McCaul's Purchase of Meta Platforms Gains Attention\n\nBut when Congressman McCaul was working against TikTok, he was also busy amassing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, according to his public disclosures. On March 5, the Congressman bought Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares worth between $100,000 to $250,000 at $490.22 per share. On March 1, he had bought somewhere between 200-498 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares, at $502.3 per share. Analysts believe a ban on  TikTok would be a tailwind for US social media companies like Meta Platforms and Snapchat. Because of such overlaps, calls for a total ban on stock trading for politicians have been growing louder. But we aren’t interested in any such bans, since as retail investors any publicly available data showing what insiders are buying is an opportunity. Why?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nStock trades from politicians in the US have always sparked controversies and made headlines over the past few years. In 2022, a Wall Street Journal investigation showed that thousands of officials working across 50 federal agencies were involved in buying or selling of stocks of companies that were directly affected by the decisions of their agencies. The Journal analyzed about 31,000 disclosures of 12,000 officials made during 2016 through 2021.\n\nDo Politicians Beat the Market?\n\nHowever, the most important question in any discussion surrounding American politicians trading stocks is this: do politicians' stock picks really beat the market? A detailed research by Unusual Whales found that in 2022, out of the 100 Congress members who traded stocks, 33% beat SPY with their portfolios. Another interesting insight highlighted in the report said that Democrats beat Republicans by significant margins. However, there were some anomalies. For example, former House Speak Nany Pelosi's portfolio, which is often a topic of discussion and is keenly watched by investors, fell about 19.8% in 2022, more than the 18% decline for the SPY.\n\nStory continues\n\nPoliticians' stock picking skills received massive attention during the pandemic days. For example, Senator Rand Paul's wife bought shares in Gilead Sciences just before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. So what? Analysts were quick to highlight that Paul was part of a Senate health committee that received special briefings from the then government about the pandemic situation in January 2020. American Politicians are Selling These Stocks\n\nThere have been several research reports highlighting instances where politicians used their influence to allegedly profit from different deals. For example a research paper titled “Trading” Political Favors: Evidence from the Impact of the STOCK Act\" talked about an interesting case from 2009:\n\n\"Politicians can favor certain groups of firms or individual firms in decisions that have significant economic impact on firm performance, such as the passage of legislations and regulations, the awarding of government contracts, and the selection into government programs. An example can be found in Congressman Tom Petri’s dealings with the Oshkosh Corporation, a manufacturer of specialty trucks and military vehicles. 2 In 2009, Representative Petri helped Oshkosh secure a $3 billion contract from the U.S. Army, after the award was challenged by a competitor and then under review by the Government Accountability Office, by sending letters and memos to colleagues and officials on the Hill and at the Pentagon including the Defense Secretary, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and the Secretary of the Army. Meanwhile, Petri owned a substantial amount of Oshkosh stock, valued at between $250,000 and $500,000, and purchased additional shares as he was making contacts on behalf of the company to resolve the dispute. Oshkosh’s stock price rose from $8 per share in early 2009 to $38 per share in February 2010, when its contract with the Army was finalized.\n\nMethodology For this article we scanned publicly available data and filings of American politicians and picked 10 stocks Congress members and senators were selling over the past few months. Some top names in the list include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n10. BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nCongressman Scott Franklin from the Republican Party on March 21 sold a stake worth between $1 million to $5 million in insurance company BRP Group Inc (NASDAQ:BRP). Since then through April 24 BRP Group Inc's (NASDAQ:BRP) shares have lost about 8% in value.\n\nIn addition to BRP, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) are also seeing insider selling.\n\n9. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nGreg Steube, the Republican Congressman from Florida's 17th congressional district, on March 28 sold shares in Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV) worth between $15,000 to $50,000 at $40.06 per share. Since then the stock is down 8%.\n\n8. Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nSenator Tina Smith dumped insulin delivery systems company Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) shares on April 4 at $163.25. The total worth of these shares was between $50,000 to $100,000. Since then the stock is up 2.45%. Senator Markwayne Mullin also sold a stake in Insulet Corp (NASDAQ:PODD) back in December 2024.\n\nCarillon Scout Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), the diabetes management device company, was the second largest detractor to portfolio performance. The company was hit by negative sentiment regarding GLP-1 agonists and their potential to reduce the number of type 2 diabetics on insulin therapy. Type 1 diabetes has become increasingly prevalent, which could offset the lower outlook for cases of type 2 diabetes, but the market ignored this development.”\n\n7. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nNextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) ranks seventh in our list of the stocks sold by American politicians in 2024. Senator Tina Smith sold a stake worth between $100,000 to $250,000 in NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) on April 4. Since then the stock has gained about 4.43%. Congressman Rick Allen also sold NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) shares worth between $15,000 to $50,000 back in December 2024.\n\nClearBridge Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We added a new position in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), in the utilities sector, which acquires, owns and manages contracted clean energy projects in the U.S. The company was at the center of the defensive stock storm when it slowed its renewable growth outlook modestly in late September, and the stock collapsed almost 30% in less than two weeks. We saw this as an opportunity to invest in arguably the best combination of a regulated utility and an experienced renewable operator with good long-term growth options. Even at a much-reduced estimated growth rate from higher financing costs, which will likely prove to be conservative, our estimate of intrinsic business value is materially higher.”\n\nLike NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NEE is also seeing selling from Washington insiders.\n\n6. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nBoeing Co (NYSE:BA) continues to suffer amid safety concerns around its planes. The stock is down 34% this year through April 25. Congressman Bill Keating from the Democratic Party on February 8 dumped a stake worth between $15,000 to $50,000 in Boein. He had also sold Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares worth between $1K to $15K on February 28 at $207 per share. Since February 8 through April 24 Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are down 21%.\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Selling These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nLatest Insider Trading Activity: 11 Stocks Executives and Directors are Buying 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Talking About\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "content": "The AI craze has returned to Wall Street — and investors are buying in.\n\nStandout quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) put the AI narrative back on track, sparking renewed confidence that big tech’s expensive bets on AI is boosting growth.\n\nAlphabet shares soared to an all-time high on Friday, closing above $2 trillion in market cap for the first time. Microsoft shares ended up 1.8%.\n\n“The AI investment story is intact,” BMO Wealth Management U.S. chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma told Yahoo Finance.\n\nOutperformance by Microsoft and Alphabet, along with Tesla (TSLA), pushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) to their best weekly performance this year.\n\n“They're delivering on earnings,” HSBC’s Nicole Inui told Yahoo Finance. “This is a secular growth story, and we think the sector continues to stay strong over the second half of the year.”\n\nResults from Microsoft and Google gave Wall Street an early glimpse at how AI will drive stocks for years to come. Microsoft said AI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% revenue jump in its Azure cloud division.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing contributions from AI helped Google’s cloud revenue surge 28%, compared to a year ago.\n\n“The commentary from both Google and Microsoft tells us that there is real demand for AI,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria told Yahoo Finance. “It's not just hype, it's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work.”\n\nIn a note to clients this week, Bank of America’s Michael Hartnett wrote that “narrow mega-cap growth leadership” will remain intact until threats of a recession materialize.\n\nAnd the AI opportunity goes far beyond Microsoft and Google — the two companies often viewed by Wall Street as leaders in the AI race.\n\nRBC Capital Markets internet analyst Brad Erickson told Yahoo Finance that Meta’s (META) selloff following earnings was an “overreaction,” and believes AI will be a “transformational driver\" for the company.\n\n“We’d be buying it,” Erickson said.\n\nThe rally in Mag 7 stocks comes ahead of key results from Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) this week — two earnings reports that will be another critical test for the tech trade amid sky-high valuations.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Apple Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "The past few weeks have been tough for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholders. The stock's now sitting 15% below its December high, sliding all the way back to where it was trading in late 2021. This is weakness that most investors just aren't accustomed to seeing from this frequent Wall Street favorite.\n\nIf you're interested in stepping into a new position in Apple, don't let the stock's recent performance rattle you. There are still good reasons to take on long-term trades in this consumer-technology titan. Here's a rundown of the best three.\n\n1. The company's dealing with the headwind in China\n\nPerhaps the single-biggest reason Apple shares have stumbled of late is the company's recent performance in China. It's not been great. The nation just isn't evolving into the growth engine it was once expected to become.\n\nIndeed, after clawing its way to becoming the country's smartphone market-share leader last year (by virtue of losing less than its rivals), technology market research outfit IDC reports Apple's iPhone lost that lead again in the first quarter of this year. It's a microcosm of the company's struggle in the region.\n\nThe company is finally dealing with the challenge if only by turning its attention to more promising markets. That's southeast Asia and India, by the way. Earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook visited Singapore, committing $250 million to expand operations there. Apple's also investing heavily in India as a manufacturing partner as well as a market for its goods and services.\n\nBloomberg reports India assembled $14 billion worth of iPhones last fiscal year, with the country also seeing the opening of its first-ever Apple store in 2023. Counterpoint Research reports Apple is now leading India's smartphone market as measured by revenue, while analysts with Morgan Stanley say India alone could account for 15% of Apple's revenue growth over the course of the coming five years.\n\nIt's certainly a compelling start to weaning itself from China where doing business is proving increasingly tricky.\n\n2. Apple is finally getting serious about AI\n\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken shape without much obvious involvement from Apple. But that's about to change. Without fleshing out any significant details, in February CEO Tim Cook said some AI-powered features of the company's next generation technology would be revealed at some point later this year.\n\nWhat sort of features? That's just it. He didn't say. Given the work the company's been doing, it's not a stretch to suggest that Apple's new A17 processor and the next iteration of its operating system (iOS 18) will likely allow iPhone owners to do generative AI work on their devices rather than in the cloud (where most generative AI tasks are actually handled right now). This of course has the potential to make Apple's onboard assistant Siri an even more powerful tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd it matters. As Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani describes it, Apple's consumer-facing AI offerings could spark a \"supercycle\" of demand for the iPhone.It's not just its consumer-oriented features that will be improved by artificial intelligence. Apple's tech is also capable of doing things like optimizing ad placements and helping digital cameras (or augmented reality equipment) understand what an object or image is.\n\nAll told, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes Apple's AI offerings could -- just as a starting point -- add another $5 billion to the company's annual top line.\n\n3. Cash is still flowing like crazy\n\nWhile sales growth has been hit and miss lately, that hasn't prevented Apple from continuing to pump up its profits. The $100.9 billion worth of net income the company's produced over the course of the past four reported quarters is nearly a record, second only to the 12-month stretch ending in early 2022 (following the surge of smartphone purchases that had been put on hold during and because of the pandemic).\n\nWhat gives? Credit the growth of Apple's services business, mostly. Sales of apps and streaming content improved 11% year over year last quarter, but more than that, this revenue is very high margin. Roughly three-fourths of the company's services sales are converted into gross profit versus only 40% of product-driven revenue. The slow shift toward more service-oriented business is proving disproportionately lucrative. And this will likely remain the case for the indefinite future.\n\nThe ultimate end result is, of course, cash flow. And Apple's got plenty of that and can do a wide range of things with this cash, including bumping up its dividend, paying off debt, or acquiring complementary companies. Few other companies have such options. AAPL Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nApple is also sitting on $73 billion worth of cash and cash-like instruments plus another $99 billion worth of marketable securities, by the way, bolstering its fiscal flexibility should it need it.\n\nBefore you take the plunge\n\nReady to dive in? There's good reason to wait just a little bit longer. That is, the company's scheduled to release its fiscal Q2 numbers after the market closes on Thursday, May 2. This could result in volatility; it might send the stock lower. We just don't know. For investors who can't stomach a rough start with a new position, missing out on a post-earnings pop is more palatable than riding out a post-earnings plunge.\n\nIf Apple shares do peel back following its Q2 results, that's absolutely a buying opportunity. This year's weakness from the stock already bakes in the worst-case scenario (and then some) without considering enough of the bullish initiatives the company is currently taking. The market may dish out one more knee-jerk reaction to any bearish spin in Q2's numbers.\n\nIf that's what ends up taking shape, however, it should actually flush out the last of the would-be sellers, leaving buyers behind for a while. That's, of course, your call to make. Just know that these timing-minded strategies usually don't matter much in the end for true long-term positions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on Jim Cramer's latest thoughts about the economy and see the top 5 stocks in this list, click Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer in a program last week welcomed signs of an economic slowdown, saying \"finally\" he is seeing \"brown shoots\" that could signal the Wall Street that the Fed might be winning its battle against inflation. Jim Cramer admitted that \"it's been hard to parse this economy.\" He said in March when a \"steaming hot\" jobs report came, it seemed like the Fed was \"blindsided\" because it was talking about multiple rate cuts this year.\n\n\"You don’t do that when the job market is booming. Anything that makes the Fed look stupid hurts its ability to maintain price stability.\"\n\nCramer Welcomes \"Brown Shoots\" Signaling Economic Slowdown\n\nJim Cramer said that just when the Wall Street was about to give up on the possibility of rate hikes, we are seeing signs of an economic slowdown. To back his thesis, Cramer talked about some examples depicting a broader cooldown in the economy. He said J. B. Hunt, the Arkansas-based transportation and logistics company, had a strong January and February but its business \"shrunk\" in March and the company's total operating revenue fell 9% during the first quarter.\n\nCramer also mentioned logistics and warehouse REIT Prologis. He said the company lowered its guidance just a month after \"coming to this show.\" Cramer was referring to Prologis CEO Hamid Moghadam's interview on CNBC with Cramer where, according to the Mad Money host, the company gave a \"bullish story.\" Cramer said during the interview the company indicated that it was experiencing weakness only in California but now it seems those problems are spreading to other areas too including Seattle and New Jersey. Cramer said part of the reason why these companies suffered is a possible slowdown in the ecommerce market.\n\n\"Because even ecommerce isn’t safe and that, you can feel.\"\n\nSnap-On Inc (NYSE:SNA) was another stock mentioned by Cramer whose earnings show signs of an economic slowdown in the US following rate hikes. The tools and equipment company posted some \"really weak numbers\" according to Cramer, and he believes that's a \"genuine surprise\" from a usually reliable company.\n\nAnother surprise came from Sherwin-Williams, which indicated that it's feeling \"choppiness\" in the business. Cramer said \"anything home related\" has been quite strong until now. But following the latest numbers, Cramer said Sherwin-Williams shares got \"clobbered.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSherwin-Williams mentioned the world \"choppiness\" or \"choppy\" several times during its Q1 earnings call. Here's a comment from Sherwin-Williams CEO from the Q1 earnings call:\n\n\"While market conditions are choppy and may give others in our industry a moment of pause, let me be clear, we are not pausing. So this morning, I’m going to talk as much about our results as I am about what we’re doing to ensure the momentum of our company not only continues but accelerates our ability to widen the gap between us and our competition. So let me start with the results of the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter is a seasonally smaller one and our results do not necessarily dictate how our full year will unfold. While our sales came in within our guidance, it was at the lower end of our range.\"\n\nRead the full Q1 earnings call transcript here. Jim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he recently recommended investors to buy or hold. Instead of major names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been repeatedly recommending for the long term, you will see some new names in the list.\n\n11. Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nMexico-based energy company Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bullish on. When asked about Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST) in a recent program, Cramer said Mexico has changed some rules in the industry which would be \"good\" for Vista Energy SAB de CV - ADR (NYSE:VIST). Cramer said that he would \"actually own\" this stock.\n\n\"I think it's a good situation.\"\n\n10. Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 30\n\nBiopharma company Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:RYTM) is a latest Jim Cramer stock pick because of obesity-related growth catalysts. When asked about the company, Cramer said it's a speculative play  but emphasized that he is \"not against speculating biotechs right now.\"\n\n\"Looks like that there are so many bids, I'm willing to let a stock catch fire,\" Cramer added.\n\n9. PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nCramer said that \"people didn’t like\" the latest PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) quarter. But he disagrees:\n\n\"I on the other hand felt it was an enjoyable quarter.\"\n\nCramer recommended investors to buy some PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) shares now and buy more when the stock comes down about 10%.\n\n\"You'll have a terrific position that will last a very long time,\" Cramer said.\n\nCarillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund stated the following regarding The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) and JPMorgan performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”\n\n8. Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 37\n\nAxon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) makes technology and weapons for law enforcement and military. Jim Cramer thinks this company is an \"ecosystem of law enforcement.\"\n\nJim Cramer said Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) is good \"even here.\" Over the past six months, Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) shares have gained about 53%.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 37 hedge funds reported owning stakes in the company.\n\nLike AXON, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer recently hit the \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" button on Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), saying the company's CEO Matthew Prince \"rocks.\" Cramer said he'd be a \"buyer\" of this stock. However, the CNBC host said he's buy Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) \"slowly\" because there's a lot of \"big selling\" going on. In addition to NET, Cramer recommends Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the tech industry for the long term.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam. Some examples include: • Another example is the leading cloud networking and cybersecurity solution provider, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), who described market share gains and customers consolidating from multiple point solutions to Cloudflare’s platform: “And so we’re the one vendor that is able to give people that vendor consolidation, that single pane of glass… that comes through in a lot of customer examples…. people want to buy the entire Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) platform. They want to protect their entire business with that, and that’s driving more interest in both our network security, as well as our Zero Trust products.”\n\n6. Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is recommending investors to hold Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) because of its high dividend yield. Cramer in a program earlier this month said the company has been \"mismanaged\" but he thinks Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) can \"bottom here\" because of its over 6% dividend yield.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds, 45 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Crown Castle Inc (NYSE:CCI) as of the end of 2023.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Portfolio: 5 Latest Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Could Propel This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock 33% Higher, a Wall Street Analyst Says",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" have been the driving force behind the current bull market. If there's one trend that's been pushing the stock prices of big tech companies higher, it's artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nPractically every member of the Magnificent Seven has a deep connection with the current push to advance AI:\n\nNvidia is the leading GPU chip designer, supplying growing data centers designed to train large language models. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) are leading public cloud providers, providing access to foundational models for developers to create new AI-powered apps. All three have big investments in their own large language models and chip designs as well. Meta Platforms is developing a leading large language model, LLaMA, spending billions on data centers to train and implement its AI across its apps. Tesla is racing toward a robotaxi service powered by its massive investments in AI.\n\nJust one member of the seven has been exceptionally quiet about its AI: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker typically doesn't like to talk about what it's working on until it's ready for release. But that could change this summer.\n\nSeveral analysts believe Apple will make several big AI-related announcements this year. And one analyst expects AI-related products and services will push its stock price to $225, about 33% higher than the price as of this writing. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe summer of Apple AI\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan sees the recent pullback in Apple shares as a great buying opportunity ahead of the company's typical event schedule, which is set for this summer.\n\nHe sees Apple making a series of AI-related announcements at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June. During the company's annual shareholder meeting, CEO Tim Cook promised investors that Apple will \"break new ground\" on generative AI this year. So the stage is set for Cook to unveil some big products and services.\n\nNobody knows what Apple could announce. While management has said it's spending a lot of time and money on generative AI, it hasn't provided much in the way of details.\n\nSeveral reports surfaced last month that Apple was in talks with Google to bring its Gemini AI to iPhones and other devices. Such a deal could be a big win for Alphabet, as its AI efforts have been dwarfed by competitors.\n\nBut putting someone else's AI chatbot on the iPhone is hardly \"breaking new ground.\" Investors should expect more.\n\nThat might have to wait until the end of summer, though, when Apple announces new iPhones. Mohan expects the 2024 iPhone model (presumably iPhone 16) will offer on-device generative AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat could be a big breakthrough for AI and data privacy, a major focus for Apple. Being able to run AI apps on a smartphone without sending data to a server for processing could open up the door for many more AI-powered applications and an AI App Store.\n\nApple is uniquely positioned to offer those capabilities on its hardware since it designs its own chips, some of the most advanced mobile processors available. What's more, they are specially designed to efficiently run Apple's software. That puts it in the driver's seat when it comes to introducing on-device AI to the mass market.\n\nShould you buy Apple before its next big announcement?\n\nThe stock has been one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2024. Shares are down more than 12%. Only Tesla's stock has performed worse, with every other member producing positive returns above the S&P 500 index.\n\nBut the current pullback in price could be a great opportunity for investors. The stock currently trades for just 25.6 times forward earnings estimates. While that multiple is higher than the S&P 500, it's below most of the other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWhat's more, Apple's strong cash position and massive capital-return program give investors good reason to pay a premium for its shares. Mohan sees the company's capital return program as another potential catalyst for shares.\n\nEven if Apple doesn't provide investors with much to get excited about in AI, the stability of the iPhone and services business make it a great company to own. Adding new artificial intelligence capabilities, especially if they delivere innovation, could send the shares much higher. At its current price Apple stock appears to have more upside than downside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Beaten-Down Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Finding \"forever\" stocks isn't easy. Corporations that can thrive and pay dividends for long periods are rare, but they do exist. Such companies tend to have several qualities, including competitive advantages and leadership in industries that are likely to continue growing.\n\nLet's consider two stocks that investors can buy and hold for good: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Abbott Laboratories(NYSE: ABT). Though neither has been popular on Wall Street lately, both have much to offer long-term, income-seeking investors.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple is facing multiple issues, including slowing iPhone sales in China and an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that it holds a monopoly in the smartphone market. The company's revenue growth is likely to be slow for the next few quarters, while its legal challenges add some uncertainty to its prospects. However, Apple has long known that it cannot forever rely on the iPhone to drive solid top-line growth.\n\nThat's why the company worked tirelessly to create a robust ecosystem of users to whom it can offer all kinds of services. Apple has an installed base of 2.2 billion devices and growing -- very few companies anywhere in the world have an ecosystem this large, and many would pay a fortune for it. That points to one of Apple's greatest strengths: Its brand name is a powerful moat. Apple's customers are among the most loyal in the smartphone market.\n\nThough the company's services unit is still relatively small in terms of revenue -- at least compared to iPhone sales -- there is a long runway for growth for several of the perks it offers, from streaming to fintech options such as Apple Pay. Apple is also working on artificial intelligence (AI), although it has lagged its similarly sized tech peers in this fast-growing space. But the company has never prioritized being first to market.\n\nApple has historically been incredibly successful by adding its own spin to existing technologies and, in some cases, had been around a while before the company got involved. It's hard to ignore the company's innovative track record or its history of excellent financial results. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nBut what about the Justice Department's lawsuit? Though this could drag on for years, it's extremely unlikely that Apple will be broken up into several companies, in my view. At worst, Apple will incur a fine or settle things out of court. Investors shouldn't worry too much about this lawsuit, although it is worth monitoring.\n\nWhat about the dividend? Apple has increased its payouts by 104% in the past decade. It currently offers a yield of 0.58%, and its cash payout ratio is just 14%. Though Apple's yield is lower than the S&P 500's average of 1.35%, the company's consistent revenue and earnings, strong innovative potential, and ability to generate cash flow make it a strong dividend stock to buy and hold for good.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nAbbott Laboratories is a leading medical device specialist. The company's revenue growth has been pretty slow lately, which partly explains the stock lagging the market.\n\nIn the first quarter, Abbott's sales of $10 billion grew by just 2.2%. However, the company is facing challenging comparisons. Abbott Laboratories was a leader in the COVID-19 diagnostics market. With much lower demand for these products, comparable sales are dropping. Abbott's revenue in the period increased by 10.8%, excluding its coronavirus-related sales.\n\nAbbott Laboratories has a long list of medical devices under its belt. The company has a strong reputation as a leader in its field. It also has deep footprints in the healthcare industry and the expertise and experience required to navigate this incredibly regulated market. These are important advantages, even before considering the many patents it holds that protect its innovative products from competition, at least for a while. The healthcare sector will continue growing, especially with the world's aging population.\n\nAbbott Laboratories offers many essential products. Some of its better-known devices still have massive room to grow. That's the case with the FreeStyle Libre, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) franchise. CGM devices are a game changer for diabetes patients relying on blood glucose meters (BGMs) to track their sugar levels. CGMs do so automatically and continuously throughout the day, while BGMs are manually operated and only measure blood glucose at a particular point.\n\nYet just 1% of the more than half a billion adults worldwide with diabetes use CGM technology -- a clear growth opportunity for Abbott Laboratories, one of the two leaders in this field. The company has many other exciting products. Abbott has been able to develop new products steadily, which has helped it generate substantial revenue and profits. ABT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe company should continue doing so for many more years.\n\nLastly, Abbott Laboratories has increased its dividends for 52 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. The company's yield tops 2.04%. Although Abbott Laboratories' cash payout ratio of 70% seems a bit high, the company's track record and solid underlying business make it unlikely that it will slash or suspend its dividends. Income seekers can safely hold this stock for good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "A Fed meeting, jobs report, and more Big Tech earnings: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks rebounded as tech earnings spawned a rally in markets despite growing concerns that the Fed will hold interest rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 4% last week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped almost 3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose less than 1%.\n\nIn the week ahead, a Fed meeting, the April jobs report, and earnings from Big Tech stalwarts Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) will test the recent optimism in markets.\n\nUpdates on job openings, activity in the services and manufacturing sectors, and consumer confidence are also on the calendar.\n\nCompanies reporting earnings include AMD (AMD), Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), McDonald's (MCD), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Starbucks (SBUX), and Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\n\nAn update from the Fed\n\nThe latest decision on interest rate policy from the Federal Open Market Committee is expected on Wednesday, followed by a media press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Markets widely expect the central bank will hold rates steady.\n\nInvestors will be closely listening for how the Fed is interpreting recent hotter-than-expected inflation data given that the market has scaled back its rate cut expectations.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\n\"Another round of elevated inflation data is likely to lead to a more hawkish-leaning message at the May FOMC meeting,\" Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a research note on Friday. \"While we expect the Committee will maintain an easing bias, we also anticipate the statement and press conference will echo Chair Powell’s view that firmer inflation prints suggest it will take longer to gain confidence about disinflation.\"\n\nSince Powell said publicly on April 16 that inflation was taking \"longer than expected\" to fall to the Fed's 2% target, data on price increases has come in above expectations. Most recently, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 2.8% over the prior year in March, above estimates for 2.7% and unchanged from the annual increase seen in February.\n\nAfter the print, investors were pricing in just a 33% chance that the Fed cuts rates in July, down from an 83% chance a month ago, per the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nWith the Fed committed to holding rates higher until it feels confident inflation is coming down, there is a continued focus on the health of the labor market. Resilient data has economists hopeful inflation can fall to 2% without the economy slipping into recession despite a higher interest rate environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe April jobs report is expected to show 250,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy, with unemployment holding steady at 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In March, the US economy added 303,000 jobs while the unemployment rate slipped to 3.8%.\n\nAnd, largely, economists don't expect there to be any signs of cracks in the strong labor market story.\n\n\"We don't expect the recent momentum in the labor market to slow,\" BofA US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday.\n\nBig Tech earnings roll on\n\nThe market's reaction to Big Tech earnings has been a mixed bag thus far. Meta's (META) plans to spend heavily on artificial intelligence, along with its softer-than-expected second quarter revenue guidance, gave investors pause. The social media giant's stock fell more than 10% following its earnings release.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) proved to be the winner of the week: Its stock popped more than 10% after the company announced a cash dividend program of $0.20 per share, approval for a $70 billion share repurchase program, and earnings results that topped estimates. The company's market cap topped $2 trillion on Friday.\n\nBaird technology desk sector strategist Ted Mortonson reasoned that a large reason behind the divergent moves in the two Big Tech stocks was a \"game of positioning.\" Meta stock had soared over the past year, while Alphabet didn't outperform by nearly as much.\n\nThis narrative will be put to the test once again in the week ahead when Apple and Amazon are scheduled to report earnings. Apple enters its report with shares down more than 11% this year amid growing concerns over a slowdown in demand. Meanwhile, Amazon is up more than 18% this year and hovering near an all-time high.\n\nEarnings scorecard\n\nBeyond Big Tech, this week will wrap up the two busiest weeks of reporting for the S&P 500. With 46% of the index having already reported for the quarter, the index is tracking for earnings per share growth of 3.5%, slightly above the 3.2% expected prior to the start of earnings season, per FactSet.\n\nAt large, companies that beat on earnings per share and revenue are seeing muted positivestock reactions, while companies that miss are seeing more negative stock performance than usual.\n\nStrategists have told Yahoo Finance it seems companies are struggling to impress investors and drive big stock reactions after a massive market rally to start the year.\n\n\"You don't just need a beat [on earnings and revenue estimates] and hold [on guidance], you need a beat and raise and confidence in the very long-term trajectory of these companies,\" Citi strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStill, there has been a silver lining in earnings reports thus far: Profit margins are increasing. The S&P 500 is pacing for a net profit margin of 11.5% this quarter, above the 11.2% seen last quarter and in line with where margins were a year ago.\n\nAs Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner noted in the Yahoo Finance Chartbook back in January, a key question for investors in 2024 has been whether or not corporates will be able to preserve margins amid sticky inflation and high interest rates. For now, the answer appears to be yes.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEarnings: Avis Budget Group (CAR), Chegg (CHGG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Logitech (LOGI), Paramount (PARA), Philips (PHG), SoFi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nEconomic news: Dallas Fed manufacturing activity, April (-11.3 expected, -14.4 prior)\n\nTuesday\n\nEarnings: Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Coca-Cola (KO), Eli Lilly (LLY), McDonald's (MCD), Oatly (OTLY), Pinterest (PINS), PayPal (PYPL), Riot Platform (RIOT), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Sirus XM (SIRI), Starbucks (SBUX), 3M (MMM)\n\nEconomic news: Conference Board Consumer Confidence, April (104.1 expected, 104.7 previously); Employment cost index, first quarter (+1% expected, +0.9% prior); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller, 20-City Composite home price index, month-over-month, February (+0.1% expected, +0.14% previously); S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite home price index, year-over-year, February (+6.59% previously)\n\nWednesday\n\nEarnings: Carvana (CVNA), CVS (CVS), Devon Energy (DVN), Estée Lauder (EL), Etsy (ETSY), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Marriott International (MAR), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), Paycom (PAYC), Pfizer (PFE), Qualcomm (QCOM), Wing Stop (WING)\n\nEconomic news: JOLTS job openings, March (8.72 million expected, 8.76million last month); S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI, April final (49.9 expected, 49.9 previously); ISM Manufacturing, April (50.1expected, 50.3 previously); ISM prices paid, April (55.8 previously); Construction spending month-over-month, Mach (+0.3% expected, -0.3% previously): Federal Open Market Committee rate decision (no change expected)\n\nThursday\n\nEarnings: Apple (AAPL), Block (SQ), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Coinbase (COIN), Cigna(CI), ConocoPhillips (COP), DraftKings (DKNG), Expedia (EXPE), Moderna (MRNA), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Peloton (PTON), Wayfair (W)\n\nEconomic news: Challenger jobs cuts, year-over-year, April (+0.7% previously) Unit labor costs, first quarter (+2% expected, +0.4% previously); Nonfarm productivity, first quarter (+1.5%% expected, +3.2% previously); Weekly initial jobless claims (217,00 previously); Factory orders, March (+1.6% expected, +1.4% previously); Durable goods orders, March final (2.6% previously)\n\nFriday\n\nEarnings: fuboTV (FUBO), Hershey (HSY)\n\nEconomic news: Nonfarm payrolls, April (+250,000 expected, +303,000 previously); Unemployment Rate, April (3.8% expected, 3.8% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, April (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, April (+4% expected, +4.1% previously); Average weekly hours worked, April (34.4 expected, 34.4 previously); Labor force participation rate, April (62.7% previously) S&P Global US Services PMI, April final (50.9 expected, 50.9 previously); ISM Services PMI, April (52 expected, 51.4 previously)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Warren Buffett's Top 3 Stocks 10 Years Ago, This Is How Much You'd Have Today",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has a massive following in the investing world. Many investors often mimic his picks, knowing that investments Buffett chooses for his portfolio have solid fundamentals and can make for good long-term investments. The three top holdings in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio today are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), and American Express (NYSE: AXP). Here's how you would have done if you invested $10,000 into each one of them 10 years ago.\n\nApple Stock: 887% return\n\nApple is the top holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, at around 41% of the portfolio. The next largest stock (Bank of America) accounts for less than 11%. Buffett is a big fan of Apple's business and it's hard not to like a company that has such a loyal customer base.\n\nIn each of the past three fiscal years (Apple's year ends in September), the company has generated at least $100 billion in pre-tax profits. And its revenue during those years has totaled at least $365 billion. The company generates great margins on its iPhones and iPads and with more than 2 billion active Apple devices, there's a huge user base to whom the company can potentially upsell more products and services.\n\nAlthough Apple's stock has been struggling this year, if you invested $10,000 into the stock a decade ago, your investment would now be worth close to $99,000 when including the dividend.\n\nBank of America: 180% return\n\nBerkshire's next-largest holding is Bank of America. It's a distant second but it's still a notable investment. Buffett loves bank stocks and insurance companies, so it's little wonder why Bank of America would be a top holding. It's one of the top banks in the country and it's one of the safest stocks investors can hold in their portfolios.\n\nBank of America generates impressive margins as its net income has totaled around $25 billion or higher in each of the past three years, and revenue during that stretch has grown from $89 billion to just under $99 billion this past year.\n\nBuffett has long been a believer in betting on America and there are few better ways to invest in the economy than by holding shares of a top bank. Even now, with Bank of America trading at just 1.1 times its book value, it's an attractive stock to own, especially when you also factor in its dividend yield of 2.6%.\n\nBank of America hasn't been the growth machine that Apple has been over the past decade, but you still would have nearly tripled your money here. When including the dividend, a $10,000 investment in the bank stock 10 years ago would now be worth around $28,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express: 209%\n\nBuffett loves financial stocks and in Berkshire's portfolio, you'll find all three major credit card companies accounted for. American Express, however, ranks higher than Visa and Mastercard. One of the reasons is likely its more affluent customer base. As is the case with Apple, these types of customers may be in better financial shape to handle the effects of rising inflation, and thus, are less sensitive to worsening economic conditions.\n\nAmerican Express has generated impressive growth in recent years as cardholder spending has hit record levels. Last year, Amex reported $60.4 billion in revenue, which was 15% higher than in the previous year and 40% more than the $43.1 billion it reported in 2021. And with net income totaling $8.3 billion in 2023, the company also generates strong, double-digit profit margins.\n\nAmex's business hasn't been slowing down and neither has the stock. If you invested $10,000 into the business a decade ago, your investment would now be worth nearly $31,000 (including dividends), slightly outperforming Bank of America during that timeframe.\n\nBy investing $30,000 across these three stocks a decade ago, you would have a profit of $128,000 -- thanks largely in part to Apple's gains. But all of these stocks have been phenomenal investments over the years and with strong financials and more growth opportunities still ahead, there's plenty of reason to remain bullish on them for the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nearly Tripled the S&amp;P 500's Returns in 2023: Here Are the Stocks She's Been Buying",
        "content": "Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has multiple major accomplishments on her resume. She's been a U.S. Representative for nearly 37 years. She's the first female Speaker of the House and the first woman to lead either chamber of Congress. Is she also a market-beating investor?\n\nThe former House Speaker nearly tripled the S&P 500's returns in 2023, giving her the ninth-best returns among members of Congress, according to options trading platform operator Unusual Whales. However, all of Pelosi's disclosures of trades listed her husband, Paul Pelosi, as the owner.\n\nPelosi's recent purchases\n\nOver the last 12 months, Pelosi has purchased only two stocks. Both are also favorites of many other investors.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, the former Speaker's husband exercised 50 call options to buy 5,000 shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for $80 per share. Apple's current share price is more than double this purchase price.\n\nMr. Pelosi has owned Apple stock for years. Other members of Congress or their families have also invested in the tech giant. Apple was second on the list of stocks lawmakers bought the most in 2023.\n\nOn the same day of the Apple transaction, Pelosi also exercised 50 call options to purchase 5,000 shares of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) for $180 per share. As with Apple, Microsoft's current share price is more than twice the strike price of those options.\n\nMore options\n\nThe initial purchases of the moneymaking call options for Apple and Microsoft were made in 2022. Paul Pelosi has been buying more call options on other stocks in recent months.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2023, Mr. Pelosi bought 50 call options for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20. 2024. At the time, Nvidia's share price was around $488.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2024, Pelosi purchased 50 call options for Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. Palo Alto Networks' share price then hovered around $372.\n\nA few days later on Feb. 21, 2024, the former Speaker's husband bought 20 more call options for Palo Alto Networks. Again, the strike price was $200 with an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. The stock had fallen significantly, though, to around $262.\n\nCall options with a strike price lower than the current share price are known as \"in-the-money\" options. Buying in-the-money call options lowers investors' upfront costs and limits the risk of loss while allowing them to profit from upward moves for the underlying stock.\n\nAre Pelosi's picks good choices now?\n\nValuation is a concern with all four stocks Pelosi likes. Apple's sluggish growth arguably doesn't justify its forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 26. Microsoft and Nvidia trade at well above 30 times forward earnings, while Palo Alto Networks' forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 47.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia should profit from the generative AI boom for years to come. The need for cybersecurity solutions should grow, boosting Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks. I think Pelosi's picks are good choices for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $374 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "Besides having wholly owned operating businesses, Berkshire Hathaway holds a massive $374 billion public-equities portfolio. In total, there are nearly four dozen stocks in which the conglomerate has a stake.\n\nYou'll quickly realize, however, that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) makes up 41% of the entire portfolio. That position has been driven by impressive share-price gains. Warren Buffett first purchased this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in the first quarter of 2016. Since the start of that year to today, Apple is up a jaw-dropping 542%.\n\nThe average investor can learn a lot by figuring out the factors that prompted the Oracle of Omaha to bet on Apple almost a decade ago.\n\nApple was a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity\n\nAround the time Buffett first scooped up Apple stock, investors were concerned about weaker demand for the newest iPhone. In fact, in surprising fashion, the business posted an 8% revenue drop in fiscal 2016 after sales jumped 28% the previous year.\n\nThe market wasn't pleased, as investors were overly focused on near-term results instead of the company's long-term trajectory. I'm sure the thinking was there wasn't much more growth potential because Apple was generating more than $200 billion in annual revenue.\n\nConsequently, Berkshire was able to buy shares at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 11. That valuation looks like an absolute steal in hindsight.\n\nThat's because this was still one of the world's best enterprises in 2016. Apple benefited from a strong brand presence, not just in the U.S., but also on a global stage. Berkshire's top holdings consist of companies that have powerful name recognition, like Coca-Cola and American Express. Perhaps no business has a more valuable brand than Apple.\n\nBuffett also certainly appreciated the company's proven pricing power. Apple sells the most popular hardware devices on the planet, a statement that has been true for a long time. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay ever-increasing prices for these gadgets that they can't live without.\n\nUnlike many of the speculative, growth-focused companies investors seem to be enamored with today, Apple was in a fantastic financial position when Buffett first purchased the stock. In fiscal 2016, Apple reported an operating margin of 28% and net income of $46 billion. Apple was also returning lots of capital to shareholders with dividends and buybacks.\n\nApple's forward returns aren't going to resemble the past\n\nNow that investors have an idea of what Buffett first saw in Apple, a bet that turned out to be incredibly lucrative, let's look at the current situation. It's hard to believe, but this is an even more dominant enterprise today, with much higher revenue and earnings potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut investors shouldn't expect forward returns to come close to matching historical gains. That's because Apple shares trade at a P/E ratio of 26.3 today -- about 150% more than what Buffett paid in early 2016. The market fully recognizes and appreciates that Apple is one of the world's elite companies.\n\nIt would be totally fine to pay that above-market valuation if the business was staring at a major growth opportunity. However, that's not the case. As much success as the iPhone has had, it is now in a mature stage of its product lifecycle. Consequently, consumers don't feel the need to upgrade to the newest model as often as they did before.\n\nWall Street analysts think Apple will be able to grow revenue and earnings per share at compound annual rates of 4% and 8%, respectively, over the next three fiscal years. That forecast doesn't come close to justifying paying the current valuation. As a result, it's best to avoid Apple stock unless there's a sizable pullback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nDespite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.\n\nApple Strikes Back with AI Plans\n\nFor example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will \"come back\" as the company is expected to provide more \"clarity\" and \"visibility\" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iOS 18.\n\nThe net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to \"warm up\" to the opportunity of Apple's \"AI upgrade cycle.\"\n\nA New AI-Focused ETF Craze\n\nRetail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.\n\nAI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says\n\nDespite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a \"forward-looking\" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the \"bar\" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities\n\nData center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.\n\nData center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:\n\n\"We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n\nWe are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n\nSupply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that’s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we’re executing reflect that yet.\n\nThere is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here. American Politicians are Buying These AI Stocks\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nIt's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying?  Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an \"overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption.\" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought a stake in IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) shares have declined by 5%.\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM’s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.”\n\n9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nSemiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought shares of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN). The biggest stakeholder of Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN) during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which had a $728 million stake in Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Shares of semiconductor manufacturing company Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company’s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.”\n\n8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 77\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) worth between $100,001 - $250,000 with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Given our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.”\n\n7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.\n\nEarlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares have gained about 5.4%.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.”\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\n\nOn January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.\n\nIn December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW) to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We trimmed our positions in Adobe and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nInsiders are Amassing These 10 Stocks in April 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer 10 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.None.

        "content": "In this article, we will be looking at the 11 best home appliance stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, you can go directly to the 5 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSince ancient times, humans have continuously advanced their domestic equipment, from the earliest use of fire for cooking to modern innovations. As we have advanced within the modern age, comfort and convenience have emerged at the forefront of our endeavors. To that end, as long as people inhabit homes, there will be a persistent and increasing demand for home appliances. The market offers a wide range of products, from compact coffee makers to spacious refrigerators capable of storing large amounts of food. While stoves and electric cookware were among the first home appliances introduced in the early 1900s, the market has since expanded significantly in terms of availability and variety. As a result, it's hardly surprising that home appliance companies rank among the largest globally, with industry leaders like Samsung and Panasonic emerging as modern-day giants. Falling within the broader consumer discretionary sector, the global home appliances market was valued at $708.15 billion in 2023. Projections indicate further growth, with the market expected to reach $1,203.11 billion by 2032, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.20% during the forecast period.\n\nOverall, stock prices of consumer discretionary companies typically fluctuate in line with the broader economy, classifying them as cyclical stocks. The most notable example in recent years came in the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed significant challenges not only for the home appliance sub-sector but also for the broader consumer discretionary sector. However, with the economy gradually reopening, investors now have a distinct opportunity within this sector. Jordan Michaels, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, anticipates sustained robust performance from the consumer discretionary sector this year. Notably, the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index closed 2023 with a notable total return of 42.41%, marking one of its strongest years to date. Apart from benefiting from a resilient consumer base, stocks within this sector capitalized on broader market trends that propelled the overall market upwards in 2023.\n\nSee also: 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy.\n\nHoming in on the home appliance market specifically, the sector is witnessing significant growth in the realm of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly successful are robots that automate simple chores like vacuuming or lawn mowing. Additionally, there's a growing market for companion robots for children and innovative projects like Tesla's assistant robot. This emergence of \"smart\" home appliances has sparked significant growth in this segment. According to a report by KBV Research, smart home appliances are projected to grow at a robust CAGR of 8.7% until 2028, reaching a value of $50 billion by the end of the forecast period. These appliances offer users a range of features, including remote control via smartphones, self-learning capabilities to adapt to user schedules, and improved energy management. Generative AI also plays a pivotal role in driving innovation, such as GE Appliances' SmartHQ app, which enhances appliance intelligence and personalization using large language models similar to those powering tools like ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe promises these combinations hold are staggering, with many company execs arguing that it could put them on par or even ahead of their biggest competitors. For example, South Korean tech giant Samsung has strived to rival U.S. Big Tech Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the realm of high-end smartphones and cutting-edge electronics for years. However, Han Jong-hee, vice chairman and head of Samsung’s Device eXperience (DX) division, asserts that with artificial intelligence (AI) technology at their disposal, Samsung stands on equal footing with, or even ahead of, its primary competitor. According to the Samsung home appliance chief, the company's brand image among consumers ranks among the world’s finest, with the company having maintained top ratings in TV sales for 18 consecutive years, and its Galaxy line of smartphones fiercely competing with Apple’s iPhones.\n\nIn light of this, this article focuses on some of the top-performing home appliance stocks currently available in the market. Among the notable picks are Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR). 11 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest in\n\nCopyright: johnkasawa / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe selected the following home appliance stocks based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 933 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.

We highlighted HBB in previous communications as supply chain woes pressured its balance sheet and market capitalization. Third quarter earnings continued trends established in the second quarter as HBB generated robust cash flow and strengthened its balance sheet. Investors were impressed, prompting a 42% rise in HBB’s shares in the fourth quarter. We are particularly proud of HBB’s operational rebound as the investment required plenty of attention over the past two years given the dour outlook in the post-Covid economy. Fund Management maintained conviction in the fundamentals, which prompted us to boost the position weighting at opportune times, and ultimately generated healthy returns for our shareholders.”\n\nMuch like Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE:SPB) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Consumer Staples. During the quarter, we initiated a new position in Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SPB), another deep value company with multiple self-help catalysts.\n\nAfter several divestitures in recent years, Spectrum is mostly a pureplay Consumer Staples company focusing on pet care and home and garden supplies, including recognizable brands such as Spectracide lawn and garden products and SmartBone dog treats.\n\nSPB is in the process of transforming itself from an acquisition-oriented holding company into an integrated operating company with sharper focus. As part of that process, the company recently divested its Hardware and Home Improvement segment, selling it to the Swedish conglomerate Assa Abloy for $4.3 billion in cash. We owned Spectrum when this divestiture was originally announced but exited our position when the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued to block the sale. That action threatened to derail SPB’s efforts to improve its balance sheet and shed a highly discretionary segment that was noncore to the company’s strategy.\n\nWe recently got clarity on this overhang, when the DOJ reached a settlement with Assa Abloy, allowing the sale to go through. This gives SPB ample capacity to repurchase shares at a steep discount to intrinsic value while setting the stage for operational improvements. Meanwhile, the stock trades at just 7X next year’s EBITDA and 5X to 5.5X normalized EBITDA.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Home Appliance Stocks to Invest In.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBill Miller’s Latest 13 Stock Picks 10 Best Weight Loss Drug Stocks to Buy Now Cathie Wood’s Latest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Goldman Sachs’ Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we'll take a look into Goldman Sachs' top 15 stock picks for 2024. If you prefer to skip the introduction about the investment bank and its recent business developments, you can just dive straight into Goldman Sachs' Top 5 Stock Picks for 2024.\n\nEstablished in 1869 by German immigrant Marcus Goldman, Goldman Sachs has evolved into the world's second-largest investment bank by revenue, amassing $1.65 billion in fees during the first quarter of 2024. From its modest origins in a one-room basement office adjacent to a coal chute, the bank has expanded steadily over the years. In 1906, it made its mark in the initial public offering (IPO) market with the iconic Sears, Roebuck, & Co. Goldman Sachs was among the pioneers in emphasizing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios over book values for company valuation.\n\nBanks are intricately linked to the fluctuations in interest rates due to their core function of dealing with money. While consumers may lament higher rates, banks often welcome them as they can widen their profit margins, known as the 'spread,' even amidst reduced borrowing demand during tighter monetary conditions. However, higher interest rates can challenge banks to manage their asset base, including funds invested in securities like bonds. Sharp rate fluctuations necessitate the revaluation of these securities, potentially resulting in losses that could jeopardize the stability of even the most profitable of banks. This was evident in the US banking crisis of 2023, particularly impacting Goldman Sachs, which reported a substantial $470 million loss in its loan portfolio during the first quarter of that year. This loss was part of the bank's efforts to restructure its retail banking division in response to the challenging environment.\n\nDespite grappling with such challenges a year ago as it ventured into Main Street endeavors, Goldman Sachs came back strong by refocusing on its core strengths. In the first quarter of this year, it surpassed analyst expectations by nearly $1 billion, garnering close to $4 billion in earnings, largely driven by substantial profits in its trading and corporate advisory divisions. While analysts anticipated a turnaround in deal-making activities, Goldman Sachs exceeded this forecast. Notably, the bank's investment banking fees soared by an impressive 32% in the latest results, reaching $2.08 billion. Additionally, the consumer banking division reported a noteworthy 24% revenue growth, marking a refreshing change after years of costly losses and write-downs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the investment bank's surge in revenues, its net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters were a mere $23 million for the first quarter of 2024, a notable reduction compared to the previous year. Additionally, Goldman Sachs trimmed its workforce by 2% following the sale of home lending firm GreenSky in October. This divestiture aligns with the bank's recent strategic shift away from consumer banking to prioritize its core offerings: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite incurring a $506 million loss from the sale in 2023, CEO David Solomon remains optimistic, citing the resurgence of capital markets and promising business prospects in Goldman's core sectors as the catalysts for the bank's turnaround. These results were especially gratifying for the bank, coming shortly after rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) experienced its sharpest stock decline in almost four years, acknowledging a more challenging outlook than previously expected.\n\nCurious about Goldman Sachs' outlook for the future? Here's a glimpse into what its management said during its first-quarter 2024 earnings call:\n\nIn debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows.\n\nIt’s important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients’ needs. And we’re growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.\n\nAmidst a backdrop of cautious optimism brewing at JPMorgan, we've scrutinized its leading stock selections. Noteworthy among them are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Misunderstood by much of Wall Street – and consequently a favorite of short sellers – Tesla continues to grow rapidly and increase its lead over the competition while delighting consumers in the process. [. . .] While we expect competition for EVs to intensify and for Tesla to lose market share over time, we also believe the company will increase production and deliveries from approximately 1.8 million vehicles today to approximately 15 million vehicles in 2030 and further its lead in autonomous driving capability. In fact, we expect Tesla will eventually license its autonomous driving software, creating high-margin (70-80%), recurring licensing revenue. Tesla is also one of only two companies that dominate the energy storage market, which has the potential to grow to several hundred billion in revenue as power plants around the world increase their focus on renewable energy.”\n\n6.

        "title": "Divest-or-Ban Law Rattles TikTok Influencers Pushing Pro-Biden Content",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When President Joe Biden returned to the White House after delivering his State of the Union address, 23-year-old TikTok influencer Awa Sanneh joined roaring cheers alongside administration staffers gathered on the mansion’s back porch.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPlunging Home Prices, Fleeing Companies: Austin’s Glow Is Fading Apple Intensifies Talks With OpenAI for iPhone Generative AI Features Javier Milei Fuels Wild Rally That Makes Peso No. 1 in World Wall Street Humbled as Fast-Reversing Markets Confound the Pros The Long, Slow Death of Urban Nightlife\n\nBiden told the group “how important” social media content is to reach Gen-Z voters, recalled Sanneh, among dozens of creators invited for a watch party that night.\n\nJust weeks later, Biden signed into law a bill that forces TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., to sell its stake or face a ban in US app stores. That has rattled the social media creators his campaign has taken unprecedented steps to court.\n\n“I'm pretty critical of him at this moment in time,” said Sanneh, who has attended multiple administration briefings and has more than 510,000 followers. “If you truly understood the impact, then you would want to keep TikTok.”\n\nBiden’s embrace of the divest-or-ban bill exemplifies his efforts to contain what administration officials and lawmakers from both parties see as a growing national-security threat from China. Nonetheless, he continues to promote his political message on the platform.\n\nNone of the influencers who spoke to Bloomberg News said Biden had lost their vote. However, the new law is likely to turn off younger voters, who've propelled the app to mainstream relevance and are key to Democratic electoral wins. Many are already unenthusiastic about Biden’s reelection.“Election after election, young people continue to show us they understand the stakes of this moment, and will vote like their futures depend on it – because they do,” said Seth Schuster, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign.\n\nKenny Walden, who has 167,000 TikTok followers and has attended White House events, posted a video on the platform expressing confusion over Biden’s decision to back the bill over privacy and data security concerns.\n\n@2rawtooreal2\n\nMy thoughts havent changed on the tiktok ban\n\n♬ original sound - 2RawTooReal\n\n“I’m against it, Joe,” said Walden, whose content focuses on encouraging people to vote for Biden. The president is silencing his “frontline of defense,” he added, referring to creators like him.\n\nWhite House officials maintain their intention isn’t to prohibit TikTok from operating, but to force the app’s Chinese owner to divest. The 270-day deadline for ByteDance extends beyond November, allowing users to continue posting through the election.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This is about our national security. This is not concerns about Americans using Tiktok,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “There's certainly time on the books to see how this plays out.”\n\nEarlier: TikTok Ban in US Looms as Biden Kicks Off 270-Day Countdown\n\nByteDance has made clear it has no intention of selling, and a protracted legal battle is likely. At the same time, Donald Trump is already using the prospect of a ban to court younger voters. In a social media post before the bill passed Congress, he blamed Biden for setting a ban in motion. That marked a reversal for Trump, who as president signed an order in 2020 banning the app that was later overturned in court.\n\nBiden’s team says its presence on the app is a vital part of a strategy to reach voters in as many arenas as possible. The app’s reach is massive: More than 170 million Americans have accounts, the company says, and a third of adults under 30 get their news from it, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nEarlier: Biden’s Campaign to Stay on TikTok Despite Divestment Law\n\nIn a first-of-its-kind push for a presidential administration, Biden's aides are in touch daily with social media influencers or their managers. Meanwhile, campaign officials are considering bringing creators into their headquarters, said a person familiar with the deliberations.\n\nThe campaign’s partnerships with popular creators are all the more important since TikTok prohibits political advertising. Organizing multiple people to push positive content beats Biden’s presence alone on the app, according to a person with knowledge of the strategy.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a TikTok account during the Super Bowl in February. It has more than 300,000 followers, which pales in comparison to those of the most popular influencers. The campaign is taking at least one known security precaution: Staffers post on the app from one separate device.\n\nBiden officials were already facing a daunting landscape on TikTok, even before he signed the divest-or-ban bill. Negative posts about the 81-year-old president proliferate on the platform, driven by frustration over his handling of the war in Gaza, his age and climate policies.\n\n“It’s very anti-Biden,” Kerry Robertson, a Minneapolis-based influencer who supports Biden, said of TikTok. “It always has been.”\n\n“Even though the algorithm isn't showing me any kind of pro-Biden content or anything like that, whenever I do those videos, I get a lot of ‘Thank you for this,'\" she added.\n\nEarlier: Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls\n\nThere is no clear evidence TikTok’s algorithm has a particular political bent, according to Neta Kligler-Vilenchik, a Hebrew University of Jerusalem assistant communication professor. But since it’s notoriously opaque, it presents a “problem” for those seeking to understand its growing political influence, said Columbia University associate communications professor Ioana Literat.\n\n“Look what's happening on TikTok,” Biden said recently at a fundraiser. “It’s so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what’s true, so we got a lot at stake here.”\n\nIt’s difficult to measure the volume of positive or negative sentiment about Biden on TikTok because the company restricts certain data. Users are often siloed in different content universes, where their feeds reflect topics they interact with the most, experts say.\n\nBiden’s team is making the calculus that they can persuade disenchanted voters to consider supporting him, in part through online content.\n\nBefore Biden’s Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March, which featured comedian Stephen Colbert and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, some TikTok creators joined a roundtable with campaign staffers about digital strategy, where Biden stopped by to speak with them, one influencer recapped in a video.\n\n@claaaarke\n\nseeing biden, obama, clinton + queen latifah in one day? high school clarke is screaming ????\n\n♬ Calm (Lofi) - Faneo sound\n\nFinnegan Biden, Biden's granddaughter, also hosted a happy hour for creators at nearby Pebble Bar before the fundraiser.\n\nSimilar to the Radio City event, behind-the-scenes visits to the White House are great fodder for social media. \"Look at this — this napkin has the seal of the president on it,\" Sanneh said in a video inside a White House bathroom that drew 2.1 million views.\n\n@_awasanneh\n\nDear Awa-Topia (the name is a work in progress- shush): your unwavering support has been the heartbeat of my journey. Your passion fuels my creativity, and your dedication lights up my darkest days. Thank you for being the foundation of this incredible life I get to live. Thank you for supporting this slightly off- putting, wierd, black girl from Texas. Gratitude flows from every corner of my heart to yours.\n\n♬ original sound - Awa\n\nIf TikTok goes away, so does a source of influencers’ revenue. Harry Sisson, a 21-year-old who has joined both official and campaign gatherings, is encouraging his 850,000 TikTok followers to watch videos on his YouTube channel, where he has been posting more because of the potential ban.\n\n“There are a lot of creators on TikTok who support them and have done a lot of work for the campaign and the president,” Sisson said in an interview. “I’m overall disappointed.”\n\n--With assistance from Alex Barinka.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns Caught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides How North Korea’s Man in the West Ran Afoul of US Authorities Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger A Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

While no one knows how long this run will last, history shows bull markets tend to last for longer stretches than when the market falls.\n\nOf course, Warren Buffett isn't fazed by these ups and downs. He focuses on investments in solid companies that he believes will grow in value over many years.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio is full of outstanding businesses. Three Fool.com contributors recently selected their favorite stocks from Berkshire's holdings. Here's why they believe Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Lennar(NYSE: LEN), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are solid buys right now.\n\nOne of the strongest brands in the world\n\nJohn Ballard (Apple): Apple stock has underperformed so far in 2024. Investors appear concerned about slowing iPhone sales in China and regulatory headwinds. But none of these obstacles impact Apple's ability to deliver growth and reward shareholders over the long term.\n\nApple was still Berkshire Hathaway's largest investment at the end of 2023, with a stake worth $174 billion. Buffett said a year ago that Apple was a better business than any Berkshire owned -- a significant statement, considering the incredible returns Berkshire has delivered over the years.\n\nThe dip is a good buying opportunity ahead of a potentially strong growth period for Apple. The company is reportedly spending up to $1 billion per year on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. It is widely speculated that Apple may release new AI features for its iOS software as early as this year.\n\nOver the next decade, AI could be game-changing for the customer experience, including potential implementation in AppleCare and Apple's productivity apps like Pages and Numbers.\n\nApple has all the cash it needs to continue improving its products. The company generated $107 billion in free cash flow over the last year, and it will keep growing as it sells more devices around the world.\n\nApple's installed base of active devices continues to hit new highs, now over 2.2 billion. While market participants focus on weak iPhone sales in China, Apple is still on the move everywhere else.\n\nThis homebuilder still looks promising\n\nJeremy Bowman (Lennar): Berkshire Hathaway surprised investors last year by going long on homebuilder stocks. Buffett (through Berkshire) purchased D.R. Horton, NVR, and Lennar. The conglomerate has since sold D.R. Horton, the country's largest homebuilder, but it still retains small positions in Lennar and NVR.\n\nWhile both of those stocks are worth buying, Lennar is cheaper than NVR and is more similar to D.R. Horton, which just reported a strong quarterly earnings report, showing that demand for new homes remains strong, and profits continue to flow into the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe won't get another quarterly update from Lennar until June, but the company looks to be in a good position to benefit from the same trends, including elevated interest trades, a lack of inventory in existing homes, and an estimated housing shortage of 4 million due to restrictive zoning laws and years of chronic underbuilding. Those factors have all contributed to elevated home prices, which is also a boon for homebuilders like Lennar.\n\nIn its first-quarter earnings report, Lennar reported 12.6% revenue growth, which drove earnings up 21% to $719 million, and earnings per share rose 25% to $2.57 as management has taken advantage of the low stock price to buy back stock. Over the last year, the company has reduced shares outstanding by about 3.5%.\n\nLennar also reported growth in all four of its regions, showing broad-based demand and execution. New orders increased 28% to 18,176 homes, showing healthy and growing demand.\n\nWith interest rates now expected to remain \"higher for longer,\" Lennar is in a good position to capitalize on the housing crunch and macro environment, and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.\n\nLennar looks like a good bet to move higher as it capitalizes on the demand for new homes.\n\nBuffett's bet was late, but still profitable\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Buffett isn't known for buying technology stocks, and he acknowledged that he was late to the game when Berkshire finally invested in Amazon in 2019, 20 years after it became a public company.\n\nAmazon had already minted millionaires, but that didn't deter Buffett from buying at that point. Buffett is all about patient investing, and he preferred to buy Amazon once it had a proven track record and strong profits while still offering tremendous opportunities.\n\nBuffett didn't buy Amazon for exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), and he probably wouldn't buy stocks today just to benefit from emerging trends. That might be part of the lesson in Buffett's investing approach: When you buy stock in great companies, you'll end up winning from these kinds of future opportunities, which Amazon has in abundance.\n\nAmazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, but its growth story still looks incredibly compelling. It's the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. by a wide margin, and e-commerce is growing faster than overall retail. It has made structural changes to its e-commerce infrastructure that speed up deliveries at lower costs, and that should enhance its dominant position as well as pad profitability.\n\nAmazon is also the leading cloud services provider, and its AI tools for code developers and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients reinforce its lead against a growing cadre of competitors. Amazon is investing in this groundbreaking technology, and it has a long, open runway in this growth story.\n\nDigital advertising has become Amazon's fastest-growing segment, and this high-margin business is another lever it's pushing to increase sales. Its AI tools for advertisers, as well as the ability for advertisers to reach customers as they shop, make Amazon a no-brainer platform for ads.\n\nGrowth stocks tend to perform well in bull markets, and Amazon is already up 75% over the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Apple has a $300bn ‘Made in China’ problem",
        "content": "Tim Cook is seen as the architect of Apple's 'made in China' strategy - NG HAN GUAN/AFP\n\nEight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone for years: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The slogan illustrated the tech giant’s two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley, and the manufacturing colossus it had become in the world’s factory.\n\nApple no longer features the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase received an update: “Designed by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.”\n\nApple is gradually weaning itself off China as a longstanding and mutually-beneficial relationship between the corporate giant and the country begins to fray.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nData released by the company last week, which outlined its relationships with hundreds of component and material providers, showed that while China remains the tech giant’s biggest single source of suppliers it is slowly turning elsewhere.\n\nLast year, 156 of 465 manufacturing sites used by Apple suppliers were in China – 33.6pc. This was down from 35.2pc and 36.4pc in 2022 and 2021 respectively, and 46pc five years earlier. The company is relying more heavily on supply chains in countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nThe huge factories where those parts are turned into finished Apple products are largely based in China. But that too is changing.\n\nIn 2022, Apple assembled just 5pc of iPhones and other gadgets outside China, according to JP Morgan. However, the company reportedly hopes to make a quarter of iPhones in India as soon as next year. Last year’s new iPhone models were the first manufactured in both India and China from launch day.\n\nApple is not alone in seeking to move production away from China. Extended Covid lockdowns there during 2021 and 2022, as well as political pressure, have pushed manufacturers to look elsewhere. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai found that last year that a fifth of US firms operating in the country were seeking to move manufacturing abroad, and two fifths were looking to redeploy investments originally planned for China.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Apple’s move is symbolic. The company has been a totem of “made in China” for almost a quarter of a century and Tim Cook, its chief executive, has been seen as the architect of that strategy.\n\nThe shift is not just about manufacturing: Apple also faces growing concerns about its own business in the country.\n\nAccording to figures from research company Counterpoint, Apple lost its position as market leader by smartphone sales in China in the first quarter of the year, falling to third place behind domestic manufacturers Vivo and Honor.\n\nIts share of the Chinese smartphone market fell by 19.1pc to 15.7pc – its lowest since 2020.\n\nThe company has been squeezed by a resurgent Huawei, whose smartphone business came close to death but which has become a national champion after overcoming US sanctions to develop advanced microchips. Apple’s position has not been helped by Beijing telling government workers not to use iPhones and other foreign devices.\n\nOn Thursday Apple is expected to report quarterly results confirming the concerns. Analysts forecast the company will report sales of $15.9bn (£12.8bn) in China, down 11pc year-on-year and the third consecutive quarterly drop.\n\nConcerns about Apple’s travails in China have seen the tech giant’s share price fall around 11pc so far this year, wiping more than $300bn off its market value.\n\nThere are further clouds on the horizon. China is becoming an increasingly assertive online regulator, ordering Apple to remove WhatsApp and Meta’s Twitter rival, Threads, from its App Store in the country earlier this month.\n\nA US bill to ban the Chinese-owned app TikTok, signed by President Joe Biden last week, may increase pressure on Beijing to respond accordingly, perhaps by punishing an American company like Apple.\n\nDonald Trump, meanwhile, has said he will impose more tariffs on Chinese imports if he wins next year’s election. Those iPhones still assembled in China risk falling foul of those rules.\n\nIf pressure builds on Apple to shift overseas more rapidly, it would not be easy, says Mark Zetter, an electronics industry consultant.\n\n“There’s nowhere else on earth currently that has the dynamics and the supply chain infrastructure that China has. For one destination to compete with China, I just don’t see that happening in my lifetime,” he says.\n\nCook, for his part, has sought to keep the peace. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” he told the state-owned China Daily newspaper on a recent trip to the country. That will continue to be the case. But bit-by-bit, Apple is chipping away at its dependence on China.",

        "title": "After Apple Stock Has Skyrocketed 527%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own It?",
        "content": "It's not a surprise that most investors closely follow Warren Buffett. Based on his track record managing Berkshire Hathaway, he's arguably the greatest capital allocator ever.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has owned many stocks over the years, but none has moved the needle quite like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire first purchased shares in the first quarter of 2016. From the start of that year to right now, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has skyrocketed 527% (as of April 19). It makes up 41% of the conglomerate's portfolio.\n\nApple's market cap is a whopping $2.6 trillion, and after such a remarkable performance, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7. This makes you wonder why Buffett still owns shares.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, I believe there are four reasons why.\n\nForever stock\n\nThe first possible reason that Buffett remains a shareholder is because his favorable holding period is forever. He hasn't even owned Apple stock for a decade yet, but this dominant business possesses traits that could make it a forever stock.\n\nIt has arguably the strongest brand on Earth, so it benefits from pricing power, with consumers willing to pay expensive prices for its hardware devices. The combination of its products with services creates an incredibly powerful ecosystem. And Apple produces insane amounts of free cash flow.\n\nBecause Berkshire isn't selling off a sizable chunk of its shares, Buffett can be sure that his firm isn't left paying a huge tax bill. This way, compounding can continue working its magic.\n\nHigh returns\n\nAnother less obvious reason Buffett is still an Apple investor is simple because he believes the stock is going to continue generating market-beating returns over the long term, which is exactly what it has done in the past.\n\nOver long periods of time, the S&P 500 produces an average annual return of about 10%, including dividends. Maybe Buffett thinks Apple has the chance to do even better than this widely followed index. If so, then there's clearly no point in exiting the investment.\n\nCapital allocation\n\nAs of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway owns 906 million shares of Apple, giving the conglomerate a 5.9% stake in the tech giant. Apple's beneficial capital allocation policies provide a massive benefit to Buffett's firm.\n\nAfter a nearly two-decade pause, the iPhone maker has paid a dividend since 2012. Its quarterly payout these days is $0.24, which translates to an unexciting yield of 0.58%. However, for Berkshire this means $870 million in passive annual income. That's a nice financial windfall.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is very keen on executing share repurchases. In the past three fiscal years, the outstanding share count has been reduced by 9%. If Buffett just stays put, his company's equity ownership will rise over time.\n\nCash pile\n\nAs outside observers, we really have no idea what's going on in Warren Buffett's head. All we can do is try and come up with explanations for his investment decisions based on the public information there is.\n\nOne piece of info we know is that Berkshire had $168 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills on the balance sheet at the end of last year. This is the case because there aren't attractive buying opportunities that are also big enough to move the needle.\n\nIf Buffett decided that he wanted to sell all his Apple shares, what would Berkshire do with the $149 billion in pre-tax proceeds (at Apple's price of $165 per share on April 19)? This would only exacerbate the current problem. Despite Apple's massive size and expensive valuation, perhaps Buffett simply believes the stock provides a better expected return than holding cash.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech’s Biggest Comeback? 3 Stocks to Buy for the Epic Rebound.",
        "content": "A lot of technology stocks are battered and bruised. Many once high-flying mega-cap tech stocks are taking it on the chin. This week, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are down more than 10% after the tech giant issued disappointing guidance and mounting losses at its new ventures unit, Reality Labs. With interest rates expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, tech stocks seem particularly vulnerable to a downturn right now.\n\nIn recent weeks, entire subsectors of tech have moved lower, notably stocks of companies working in the areas of semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. How long the current downturn lasts is anyone’s guess. That said, there are some tech stocks that are showing tentative signs of recovery and could be poised for a turnaround in coming months, driven by earnings and other catalysts. Here are three tech stocks to buy in anticipation of an epic rebound.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is by no means out of the woods. The electric vehicle maker just reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 and its first-quarter profit plunged 55% from a year earlier. That said, the worst of the selloff in TSLA stock appears to be over. In the two days since the company’s Q1 print, Tesla’s share price has risen 13%. The stock now looks to have bottomed at $138. Investors looking to bottom fish Tesla might want to buy the stock now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA lot is riding on the company’s ability to bring a more affordable electric vehicle to market by early 2025, as CEO Elon Musk promised during the Q1 earnings call with analysts and media. Cost controls and plans to cut 10% of Tesla’s workforce will also be important, as is the ability to license its driver assistance system to other automakers. If Musk and his management team can pull it all off, then Tesla could prove to be one great comeback story. In the meantime, TSLA stock is trending upwards.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has been a long-term laggard. In the last five years, TXN stock has risen 50%. Compare that to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 1,817% gain over the same period. While disappointing, Texas Instruments looks like it might be starting to get its mojo back after years of chronic underperformance. The company’s share price rose 7% in a day after the legacy tech concern reported better-than-expected financial results for Q1 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTexas Instruments reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.20, which was much better than Wall Street forecasts of $1.07. Revenue during the first three months of the year came in at $3.66 billion, also ahead of analyst estimates of $3.6 billion. In terms of guidance, Texas Instruments forecast Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion, and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The Q2 guidance aligns with Wall Street forecasts.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt might not be long before consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stages an epic rebound. In 2024, AAPL stock is one of the worst performers among tech securities. So far this year, Apple’s share price is down nearly 9%, and a laggard in the benchmark S&P 500 index. However, there are potential catalysts looming on the horizon. All eyes will be on the company’s May 2 earnings report. People will also be watching a May 7 event where Apple is expected to unveil a revamped version of its iPad tablet.\n\nApple’s signature tablet, the iPad, launched in 2010 and has not been significantly updated since 2018. A new iPad could help to boost sales of the device, which declined 25% to $7.02 billion in this year’s first quarter, according to industry estimates. Sales across all Apple products have suffered amid economic uncertainty and as consumers cutback on spending. Revitalizing its electronic devices could boost sales and AAPL stock. Unveiling AI applications at its developers conference in June could also help.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 things people waste the most money on. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Things People Waste the Most Money On.\n\nMoney Wasting Trends and Statistics\n\nWhile people raise concerns about inflation and their ability to save, they overlook the amount of money wasted that could have been invested or saved. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Board, the overall financial well-being of an average adult in the US declined by 5% from 2021 to 2022. As per the survey, 73% of the adults reported being at least okay financially in 2022. Moreover, 35% of adults reported being financially worse off than the previous year.\n\nSome of the prominent things people waste the most money on in the US include food, dining out, alcohol, and impulse buying. One of our recent articles on the 20 Countries That Waste the Most Food discussed how the United States of America is one of the top countries to waste the most food, wasting approximately 19.3 million tons per year. According to a survey conducted by Cherry Digital, a communications agency, American households waste an average of $907 annually. Looking at a state-wise analysis, even the least wasteful state, West Virginia, was recorded to waste food worth $405 per household annually. Moreover, according to the survey, households in South Carolina were wasting approximately $1,305 worth of food each year. In addition to the money wasted on food, Americans spend extensively on dining out. The Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture found that for a typical dollar spent on food in the US, 34.1% accounted for restaurants and dining-out services in 2022. Moreover, 12.4% of the remainder of the food dollar went to retail trade.\n\nAlcohol consumption rates are high in the US. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAA), approximately 172.7 million adults aged 18 or above reported drinking during 2021. This amounted to approximately 67.4% of people in the age group. While drinking has adverse effects on health, it is not pocket-friendly either. The American Addiction Center, while addressing the cost of alcohol, found that even the drinking habit of 1 glass a day costs, on average, $1,456 per year, whereas consuming a bottle a day can cost up to $607 a month and $7,280 a year. In addition to the first-hand cost of drinking, there are various hidden costs associated with the habit. For instance, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the US economy lost approximately $179 billion due to an alcohol-related decrease in productivity in 2019. To read more about alcohol consumption rates within the US, you can look at the 20 States that Consume the Most Alcohol per Capita.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvice from Successful Entrepreneurs and the Rise of Retail Investing\n\nWarren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, is among the most successful investors of all time. He is the chairperson of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). One of Buffett's best quotes about business, investing, and life is \"Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving\".\n\nWhile saving money is a good approach to managing money, putting money to work is an even better approach. One of the ways you can use your money positively is to invest in stocks, bonds, assets, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Robert Kiyosaki, a famous American Businessman and author renowned for his book Rich Dad Poor Dad says, \"The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left\".\n\nRetail investing is on the rise in the US. According to a report by JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), the percentage of households with investments in stocks increased to 58% in 2022 from 49% in 2013. Moreover, lower-income individuals were 4 times more likely to transfer funds to their investment accounts in 2023 as compared to 2015. Moreover, another report by S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) found that retail ownership across all market caps grew by 5.6% between 2020 and 2022. Small-cap companies witnessed the greatest increase of 7.1%, and from a sector perspective, stakes in energy companies increased over 7.2% during the same period.\n\nOne of the top companies that have influenced the rise of retail investors is Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), a financial services company that pioneered commission-free trading and increased the accessibility of financial markets for retail investors. On March 13, Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) reported its operating statistics. The platform had 23.6 million funded customers towards the end of February, up by approximately 130,000 from January. Moreover, the trading volumes of Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) were high across all asset classes compared to January 2024. The Equity Notional Trading Volumes for February were $80.9 billion, whereas the Contracts Traded and the Crypto Notional Trading Volumes were recorded to be 119.1 million and $6.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTop Stocks for Beginner Investors\n\nIf you are new to investing, blue chip stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) can be good starting points. These are beginner-friendly stocks with low risk, high stability, and a track record of profitability. To read more about the best stocks for beginners, you can look at 10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Reddit.\n\nApple Inc.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Bought Some Time With Long-Term AI Potential\n\nOn Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn’t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company’s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company’s leadership on the AI front.\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded 27% YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter.\n\nAs for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20.\n\nDigital advertising makes 98% of Meta’s revenue and it rose 27% YoY to $35.64 billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars.\n\nThe Metaverse Continues To Bleed Cash\n\nWith revenue of $440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta’s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion.\n\n2024 Guidance\n\nAs for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion.\n\nMeta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting $30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments.\n\nMeta bought some time with long-term potential of AI.\n\nAfter a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that, thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street’s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn’t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company’s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company’s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is deepening its involvement with China while expanding its production in Southeast Asia and India, illustrating the iPhone maker’s delicate balancing act between political pressures and business needs.\n\nIn 2023, Apple increased its number of China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites, reducing its reliance on suppliers from Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, according to a Nikkei Asia review of Apple’s latest official supplier list.\n\nApple publishes an official list of its suppliers nearly every year. The most recent list includes 187 companies, accounting for 98% of the company’s procurement for fiscal 2023.\n\nSince 2020, Chinese suppliers have become the largest group within Apple’s supplier network, growing to 52 in the last year from 48 in 2022. The number of manufacturing or development facilities in China, including those owned by domestic and foreign companies, increased by 10 to 286.\n\nAs Apple accelerates its supply chain shift to Southeast Asia amid the ongoing U.S.-China tech conflict, its ties with China continue to deepen.\n\nThe number of Apple suppliers in Vietnam surged by 40% to 35 last year, while the number in Thailand increased by about a third to 24. The number of suppliers in India remained stable at 14.\n\nHowever, this growing presence in India and Southeast Asia does not necessarily mean a reduced dependence on China.\n\nPrior reports conjectured that Apple reduced its dependence on China due to growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China after which Washington imposed a semiconductor technology embargo on China which included import of sophisticated AI chips from Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other chip designers.\n\nNikkei Asia’s analysis indicates that approximately 37% of the 35 suppliers in Vietnam are from China and Hong Kong, including AirPods assemblers Luxshare and Goertek and iPad assembler BYD.\n\nAll three have increased their production capacity in the country to serve Apple.\n\nTaiwanese suppliers remain the second-largest group in the Apple supply chain, followed by U.S., Japanese, and South Korean suppliers.\n\nA significant portion of its supply chain is in China, and revenue from Greater China — the world’s largest consumer electronics market — still accounted for 17% of its total revenue in the December quarter.\n\nAccording to IDC data, Apple’s shipments in the first quarter of this year dropped nearly 10% globally, a steeper year-over-year decline than peers like Samsung and Xiaomi experienced.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrior reports indicated that Apple is offering the iPhone 15 series at steep discounts in China through resellers, implying softening demand.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring anticipates a slight revenue increase for the March quarter.\n\nStill, he expects a significant downward revision for the June quarter guidance compared to consensus, which may initially disappoint the market.\n\nDespite this, he sees potential for a relief rally at Apple, especially with the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) expected to showcase new AI software features.\n\nWoodring notes the possibility of a nearly 30% upside to his new price target and a pivotal AI-driven iPhone cycle in fiscal 2025, focusing on total revenue, China iPhone shipments, and Services revenue growth in his analysis.\n\nApple stock gained 4% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and SPDR Select Sector Fund – Technology (NYSE:XLK).\n\nPrice Action: AAPL shares traded higher by 0.39% at $170.55 premarket at the last check Friday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nImage Source – Apple\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple Strengthens Supply Chain in China While Growing Presence in Southeast Asia and India originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Top 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy in April 2024",
        "content": "Everyone knows today’s top semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which often attract the bulk of investor attention and capital.\n\nHowever, lesser-known top semiconductor stocks are lurking in the market, ready to skyrocket as artificial intelligence and machine learning tech evolve and trends accelerate. To find these overlooked semiconductor stocks, keep two criteria in mind. First, identify top semiconductor companies specializing in niche components critical to specific applications, such as parts for electric vehicle assemblies. These firms often dominate their market niches and maintain strong positions.\n\nFor other top semiconductor stocks, look to those supporting the wider industry and not directly competing with the likes of Nvidia or AMD — find semiconductor stocks providing key peripheral services to those companies, and you’ll find semiconductor stocks set to explode no matter which specific company dominates the industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInfineon (IFNNY) a close up image of a semiconductor. 5X Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInfineon’s (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) top semiconductor stock status lays at the intersection of multiple emerging automotive trends: EVs and increasingly complex internal “dashboard tech” in cars of all types. The European semiconductor manufacturer embeds its components in various vehicle systems, including infotainment platforms and Bluetooth interfaces.\n\nFurthermore, Infineon’s chips are essential to less visible — but key — EV functions like anti-lock braking systems, airbag deployment mechanisms and air conditioning. As EVs continue to advance into lower-end market segments due to decreasing research and development costs, the demand for these semiconductors is set to surge. Infineon stands out as one of the key players poised to benefit from this increasing demand.\n\nLikewise, the outlook for EV infotainment systems is particularly promising. A research report projects a 38% annual growth in demand for these systems through 2030. As vehicle interiors become more complex, the need for semiconductors intensifies. Infineon’s strategic position in this specific area of the EV value chain distinguishes it from other semiconductor manufacturers offering more general-purpose solutions.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a niche semiconductor stock that’s a top operator in the 5G and wireless data sector. It provides essential semiconductors for the wireless ecosystem in cell towers and individual user phones. Skyworks’ specific benefits lay in globally expanding 5G network connectivity, as its components are crucial for band switching and other functionalities associated with 5G.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Skyworks enjoys a broad market opportunity, it is significantly reliant on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounted for nearly 60% of its 2022 revenue. Although such dependence on a single customer poses risks, the burgeoning 5G market, expected to grow at an annual rate of 32% through 2030, gives Skyworks a decent safety net backstop.\n\nInstitutional investors, who own 84% of Skyworks shares, reinforce the stock’s strength. Following the smart money — large institutional investors — is often a wise strategy for niche tech like semiconductor stocks. With 19 institutions holding more than half of the company’s shares, their substantial commitment signals a strong belief in Skyworks’ potential, suggesting something uniquely compelling about this semiconductor stock.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) In Ultra Modern Electronic Manufacturing Factory Design Engineer in Sterile Coverall Holds Microchip with Gloves and Examines it. Semiconductor stocks to sell. Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOnto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO) is a top semiconductor support stock rather than a chipmaker, but it is indispensable to the industry and still benefits from wider sector trends. Its year-to-date 26% climb signals strong momentum, but that’s just part of the company’s growth trajectory.\n\nIn August last year, Onto announced a significant $100 million deal for its Dragonfly inspection system. This system is crucial for detecting flaws in semiconductors made by third parties, addressing a vital need for major companies like Nvidia. Onto’s robust position in the semiconductor supply chain stems from the essential nature of its inspection services, positioning it as a key service provider to a wide range of semiconductor clients. Likewise, Onto’s customer base broadens as semiconductors become increasingly fundamental to all electronic systems.\n\nWith AI demand continuing largely unabated, the GPUs and related technology market is projected to expand to $25.5 billion by 2030. Onto is ideally placed to benefit from this growth as the semiconductor sector races to advance, regardless of which companies emerge as leaders in the competitive market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Amazon, Apple, Anglo American and Novo Nordisk",
        "content": "Amazon is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nEarnings season is in full swing, and investors have some high expectations for some of the mega-caps reporting next week such as Amazon and Apple. In the UK, investors should still keep a focus on Anglo American as the bid rejection from BHP is unlikely to be the last move by the Australian miner.\n\nIn Europe, the continent's most valuable company Novo Nordisk will show if it still reigns supreme.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nAmazon (AMZN) – Reports on Tuesday 30 April\n\nAhead of the company’s quarterly results, several analysts have been reaffirming their bullish views on the stock.\n\nAmazon is scheduled to report its first-quarter financial results after the US market close on 30 April. The company is expected to report earnings of 83 cents per share on revenue of $142.495bn, according to estimates from Benzinga Pro.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTotal net sales of $142.59bn are predicted, up from $127.36bn a year ago.\n\nWedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note that ads on Prime Video could generate about \"$6.5bn of incremental revenue\" once it is fully in place across the world.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in his shareholder letter earlier this month that he thinks artificial intelligence could be the \"largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\"\n\nAmazon’s market cap nearly reached $2tn for the first time in April and even after a slight pull back, the shares are still up by nearly a fifth in 2024 and by two-thirds over the past year (to rank it third among the Magnificent Seven, behind Nvidia [NVDA] and Meta [META]).\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Alphabet, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon and Anglo American\n\n“One of the reasons behind this stunning run is Amazon has re-established its powerful earnings momentum, which was briefly lost in late 2021 and early 2022, as fears of a recession gathered, inflation and interest rates rose, and oil prices increased input costs,” according to investment director Russ Mould, head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and investment analyst Dan Coatsworth, all of AJ Bell.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Another is the perception that Amazon is a winner in the race to lead, and monetise, the development of generative AI, thanks in particular to its cloud-service business AWS [Amazon Web Services] which makes far more money than the US and International retail arms and is the real heart of the business now. That said, North America roared back in 2023 to also record its highest-ever quarterly and annual operating profit, buoyed by free-spending US consumers,” they added.\n\nApple (AAPL) – Reports on Thursday 2 May\n\nApple, one of the most important names in the stock market, but the iPhone maker’s performance as been anything but stellar.\n\nThe stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among mega cap technology companies.\n\nThe consensus estimate for sales is $89.8bn, down 5.3% year-on-year (compared to the 2.1% year-on-year increase in Q1). In the unlikely event Apple gives any steer for Q3, analysts are looking for $82.7bn, up 1.0% year-on-year, according to AJ Bell.\n\nFor share earnings per share, or EPS, analysts are looking for $1.50 for net income of around $2bn, down a fraction from $1.52 a year ago. In Q3, analysts are looking for $1.31, marginally higher than in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAnalysts are split over the stock, with Morgan Stanley analysts expecting the iPhone maker will slightly top the consensus estimates.\n\nBank of America (BofA) also seems bullish, recommending the company given its “rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows”, according to BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.\n\nMorningstar is wary of iPhone sales that have been hit by a sales slump in China.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks rise as traders digest US tech earnings and Bank of Japan decision\n\n“We anticipate a weak quarter for iPhone sales, which Apple has guided Wall Street to expect. This should spur a poorer overall quarter for the firm, as the iPhone remains its primary driver.\n\n“We expect another quarter of strong profitability for Apple helping offset weaker sales growth. Apple benefits from a higher mix of its services business and more consumers opting for premium options like the iPhone Pro models,” Morningstar wrote.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, “will likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus’ 2% drop”.\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nNot reporting but set to keep making markets move in the UK as in these mega deals the first bid rejection is just the start of negotiations to find the right price.\n\nBritish mining giant Anglo American has rejected a £31.1bn takeover offer by Australian rival BHP (BHP.L).\n\nThe FTSE 100 miner said the bid was “opportunistic” and “significantly undervalues Anglo American and its future prospects”. Strong words but not enough to stop BHP, according to analysts.\n\n“There’s every chance BHP will come back to the table,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nBHP said in a statement Thursday that it valued Anglo American shares at £25.08 ($31.40) apiece, or £31.1bn ($38.9bn) in total.\n\n“It’s no surprise that Anglo American has rejected BHP’s takeover bid. Anglo American has long seen itself as one of the big players in the market and it certainly won’t let a rival swoop on the business when its chips are down,” AJ Bell’s Mould said.\n\nRead more: Barclays profits slip amid mortgage squeeze\n\n“The usual playbook for mega deals in the resources space is for the original suitor to respond to rejection by coming back with a better offer, or someone else throwing their hat into the ring. That contender could be Rio Tinto (RIO.L) as it will certainly be watching activities with keen interest given it can see the same opportunity as BHP,” he added.\n\nAnglo’s shares surged by 16.1% on Thursday after news of the bid emerged and they are certain to be under the spotlight next week.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) – Reports Thursday 2 May\n\nThe US has the Magnificent 7, Europe has Novo Nordisk and friends, according to UBS. The investment bank has put together an equivalent list of 18 outperformers for Europe so this stock should definitely be on your radar when it reports next week.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that the pharma company sold 10.4bn Danish kroner’s ($1.5bn/£1.2bn) worth of its weight-loss drug Wegovy in the first quarter, more than twice the year-earlier figure, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.77, marking a 20.31% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nA steady ramp-up in starting dose scripts points to even bigger sales in the second half, Barclays said.\n\nCiti analysts said they would not be surprised to see the company adjust its full-year outlook as consensus is already close to the top of the forecast range.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 38.79. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.05, according to Zacks Equity Research.\n\nNovo Nordisk has become Europe’s most valuable company by market capitalization, taking the crown from luxury group LVMH (LVMUY).\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday April 29\n\nParamount (PARA)\n\nVivendi (VIV.PA)\n\nTuesday April 30\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nLufthansa (LHAD.XD)\n\nAir France-KLM (AF.PA)\n\nVolkswagen (VOW.DE)\n\nHSBC (HSBA.L)\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD)\n\nSantander (SAN.MC)\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nPaypal (PYPL)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nWednesday May 1\n\nNEXT (NXT.L)\n\neBay (EBAY)\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC)\n\nBarrick Gold (ABX.TO)\n\nMarriot International (MAR)\n\nThursday May 2\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nArcelorMittal (MT.AS)\n\nStandard Chartered (STAN.L)\n\nExpedia (EXPE)\n\nA.P.

        "content": "Snap upgraded, Apple downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. \r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nHSBC double upgraded Snap(SNAP) to Buy from Reduce with a price target of $15.10, up from $10. The company reported a strong set of Q1 results, marked by return of double-digit growth, the analyst says. Barclays upgraded Enphase Energy(ENPH) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $134 price target, up from $115. Current share levels provide a \"reasonable entry point\" as de-stocking will be completed by the end of Q2 and demand is set to increase from trough levels throughout 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Raymond James upgraded Kratos Defense(KTOS) to Strong Buy from Outperform with a price target of $27, up from $20. Drones and air defense demand has accelerated with the ongoing and escalating conflicts globally, the analyst tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan upgraded Dow Inc. (DOW) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $61, up from $55. The analyst says Dow is capable of outperforming because it is a beneficiary of higher oil prices, it has a \"durable\" 5% dividend yield, its value is sensitive to acceleration in global economic activity, and its downside risk is \"cushioned by the existence of global political tensions.\" Benchmark upgraded Western Digital(WDC) to Buy from Hold with an $85 price target. Western Digital produced \"major upside results\" driven by improving flash pricing and nearline drive sales, notes the analyst, who sees continued improvements in NAND pricing and nearline sales as 2024 progresses.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nErste Group downgraded Apple(AAPL) to Hold from Buy. Apple's growth momentum continues to slow and the company's new products do not currently have the potential to significantly improve sales momentum, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley downgraded Mobileye(MBLY) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $25, down from $26. While the company's leadership in computer vision creates option value for new content growth, a surprise slowdown in electric vehicle adoption limits its total addressable market through 2030 amid aggressive competition, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Erste Group downgraded AMD(AMD) to Hold from Buy. The valuation is \"significantly higher than the P/E ratio of the peer group,\" as well as compared to \"much stronger competitor\" Nvidia (NVDA), the analyst tells investors. JPMorgan downgraded Boyd Gaming(BYD) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $67, down from $80. The analyst says there is no way to sugarcoat Boyd's Q1 earnings miss as it was \"broad based and very surprising.\" BofA downgraded Hertz(HTZ) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $3, down from $9, telling investors that the company's Q1 results \"well below\" BofA and Street estimates failed to allay concerns about higher fleet costs that are unlikely to meaningfully subside in the near-term.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nB. Riley initiated coverage of MacroGenics(MGNX) with a Buy rating and $25 price target. The analyst views the company's most advanced candidate, vobra duo, as \"significantly de-risked\" in the ongoing over-enrolled Phase II TAMARACK registration-enabling study, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Scotiabank initiated coverage of Qualys(QLYS) with a Sector Perform rating and $172 price target. Qualys has \"a rock-solid reputation in vulnerability management,\" but \"the firm needs more than one string to its bow,\" the analyst tells investors. Ladenburg initiated coverage of Spire(SR) with a Neutral rating and $57.50 price target. The firm believes that Spire's primary subsidiaries, Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri, are poised for continued growth due to favorable commissions and legislation. DA Davidson initiated coverage of Napco Security(NSSC) with a Buy rating and $52 price target. The firm says Napco has a \"powerful recurring revenue flywheel\" that was set in motion via its cellular connectivity radios. B. Riley resumed coverage of Full House Resorts(FLL) with a Buy rating and $9 price target. The analyst believes American Place's March EBITDA was over $3M, a $36M run-rate versus last year's $18.4M 11-month results.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Now",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Nutanix (NTNX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 26 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 22, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.18 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.18 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.17 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Nutanix has an Earnings ESP of 8%.\n\nNTNX is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Apple (AAPL).\n\nApple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 2, 2024. AAPL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.52 a share six days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Apple, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 is 0.93%.\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NTNX and AAPL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best technology dividend aristocrats to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of tech dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Technology Dividend Aristocrats to Buy.\n\nMeta’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year took the tech world by storm. However, this is not the first time any company has initiated a dividend from the sector which is typically recognized for prioritizing buybacks over dividend payouts.  According to a report by Goldman Sachs’ portfolio strategy team, slightly less than 40% of the technology companies within the broad-market S&P Composite 1500 distribute dividends. Moreover, some tech stocks are offering dividend yields as high as 3%, which is generally considered very healthy according to analysts.\n\nAlso read:\n\n15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDividend distribution within the tech sector has grown gradually over the years. In 2011, only one in four tech stocks paid dividends to shareholders. Over the past decade, there has been a shift in this trend due to investors showing more interest in dividend-paying equities. A report by S&P Global revealed that as of 2020, 26 companies started paying dividends within the tech sector of the S&P 500, while 59 companies raised their payouts at different times throughout the years. This resulted in a total of 376 dividend increases within the sector. The report also mentioned that over this period, as more Information Technology companies initiated dividends, their impact on the total return of the S&P 500 increased from 9.07% in 2009 to 16.33% in 2019.\n\nIrrespective of the industry, dividend growers have always taken the lead among investors when it comes to investing in dividend stocks. In the case of technology dividend stocks, some might assume that these companies simply maintain their dividends without following any consistent growth. However, this assumption does not hold true, as many technology and tech-related companies are actually known for regularly growing their payouts. According to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, tech companies within the S&P 1500 index have nearly quadrupled the total dollar value of their dividends by 2022 in comparison to what they paid in 2011. This growth rate stands out as the highest among all sectors, far exceeding the 2.6% increase in dividends from the entire S&P Composite 1500 index during this period.\n\nThe S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of tech companies with at least seven consecutive years of dividend growth, has gained 13.27% in the past year. The index is down by 3.15% this year so far. It has reported a strong performance over the years. The index surpassed both the S&P Total Market Index (TMI) Information Technology and the S&P TMI in performance over one- and three-year periods between 2014 and 2022, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. In addition to this, the index exhibited lower volatility than the S&P TMI Information Technology throughout one-, three-, and five-year periods within this timeframe. The report further elaborated that from December 2014 to December 2022, the index saw its dividends grow at an annual rate of 14.72%, compared with the 11.30% and 6.42% growth rates of the S&P TMI Information Technology and the S&P TMI Index, respectively. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best technology dividend aristocrats to consider, among others that are further discussed in this article.\n\nStory continues 10 Best Technology Dividend Aristocrats to Buy\n\nPhoto by Artem Beliaikin on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of the S&P Technology Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of technology and technology-related companies that have raised their dividend payouts for seven consecutive years or more.

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "Technology stocks had a great run in 2023. This year, not so much. In the past month, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index has fallen 5%. Mega-cap tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have faltered badly amid escalating concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer. Possibly much longer. At the same time, notable tech leaders such as Apple appear in rapid decline, having lost their competitive edge and market share.\n\nIn time, the market and tech stocks will almost certainly get their mojo back. However, there look to be some technology companies that are facing existential threats that could eventually see them pushed out of business. Threats are taking the form of increased competition, disruptive technologies, and changing consumer tastes. History is littered with once mighty companies that lost their edge and never regained it.\n\nHere are three tech stocks that could be heading six-feet under.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nThe stock of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) hasn’t been the same since privately held OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) introduced Sora, an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions. OpenAI’s Sora platform competes directly against many of Adobe’s creative software products and concerns are mounting that AI will ultimately put the company out of business. ADBE stock is down nearly 20% on the year following Sora’s debut and after the company issued weak forward guidance.\n\nAdobe, whose suite of creative software products includes Photoshop and Illustrator, did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its latest earnings. However, the company forecast earnings of $4.35 to $4.40 a share and revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion for the current second quarter. That fell short of expected earnings of $4.38 a share and $5.31 billion in revenue, sending ADBE stock down 12% in a single trading session. Adobe is adding AI where it can, unveiling a new AI assistant for its Reader and Acrobat apps.\n\nIn a move that looks like it is waving the white flag, Adobe is reportedly now exploring a partnership with OpenAI and looking to add Sora’s technology to its products. The question is: will it be enough?\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) logo on a smartphone screen stock image. Tesla is an innovative company focused on producing sustainable electric vehicles and clean energy solutions\n\nSource: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAre things suddenly better at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)? On the day of this writing, TSLA stock is up 12% as investors cheer the company’s plan to rush a more affordable electric vehicle to market. However, the euphoria over a cheaper electric car overlooks the fact that Tesla’s latest earnings print was terrible and showed that things are getting worse at the company. Much worse. For this year’s first quarter, Tesla reported its biggest revenue decline since 2012 as it missed Wall Street’s targets across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales were down 9% from a year ago, while Tesla’s net income plunged 55% year-over-year. Tesla also issued a dismal outlook for the remainder of the year, stating that its “volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.” Tesla continues to struggle with slowing electric vehicle sales and rising competition that has forced it to slash prices at the expense of profit margins. As for the more affordable EV, Tesla is famous for overpromising and underdelivering. Any sign of the “Tesla Bot” yet?\n\nDespite the post-earnings lift, TSLA stock remains down 35% on the year and continues to be one of the worst performing stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has been trying to merge with another entertainment company or possibly sell itself as its stock slides lower. At the start of this year, the company was in merger talks with Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA), although the negotiations were called off in February. Warner Bros. is trying to achieve economies of scale as it struggles to earn profits from streaming while grappling with a decline in advertising revenue at its linear TV stations and dwindling audience attendance at movie theaters.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is also labouring under a crushing debt load. While the company paid down $5.4 billion of debt in 2023, it still has $44.20 billion of debt remaining following its 2022 merger with Discovery Inc. Warner Bros. most recent earnings print was bad, with the company reporting a loss of 16 cents a share compared to a loss of 7 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 came in at $10.28 billion, which was below forecasts of $10.35 billion.\n\nThe litany of problems has weighed heavily on WBD stock, which is down 66% in the two years since Warner Bros Discovery was formed.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 10 best streaming service stocks to buy. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the streaming industry and recent trends shaping the streaming market, go directly to 5 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy.\n\nIn recent years, the streaming TV landscape has seen a rapid expansion, with numerous new options entering the market. With a plethora of subscription internet TV services available, streaming entertainment has become a staple in American households, evidenced by the 99% of U.S. households subscribing to one or more streaming platforms.  Leading the pack are Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s TV+. This widespread adoption reflects a shift in entertainment consumption, moving away from traditional cable TV models towards flexible, on-demand streaming options. On average, Americans maintain subscriptions to around 2.9 streaming services each month.\n\nAccording to a research report by Fortune Business Insights, the video streaming industry is a significant economic force, currently valued at an impressive $544 billion. This valuation not only reflects the industry's current success but also hints at its rapid expansion in the future. Projections suggest that by 2030, the industry could skyrocket to a staggering $1,902 billion. The financial trajectory of the video streaming industry also continues to surge, with revenue expected to reach $43.97 billion in 2024 alone. This robust growth is anticipated to persist, with revenue forecasted to climb to $54.22 billion by 2027, boasting an annual growth rate of 7.53% from 2024 to 2027.\n\nData from Nielsen, a leading data and market measurement firm, proves that the rise of streaming services has fundamentally altered TV viewing habits, with streaming content now being the primary driver of TV usage. In 2023, American audiences streamed a staggering 21 million years of video, marking a 21% increase from the 17 million years' worth they streamed in 2022. Amid these viewership patterns, one clear beneficiary emerged: the TV show \"Suits.\" Originally aired on USA Network from 2011 to 2019, \"Suits\" amassed a total of 57.7 billion viewing minutes in 2023, surpassing even the beloved favorite \"The Office,\" which garnered 57.1 billion viewing minutes in 2020 during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. In total, the top 10 titles in the U.S. collectively garnered over 133 billion minutes of viewing time last year.\n\nHowever, akin to other sectors, the streaming industry encounters its own set of challenges, most notably marked by heightened competition, which has spurred companies to invest billions in developing their own platforms and content libraries, aiming to compete with established industry leaders, which in turn prompted streaming services to adjust their subscription costs. For instance, The Verge reports that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has made changes to its subscription offerings, discontinuing the ad-free Basic plan priced at $11.99 per month for new or returning members. Instead, the company is transitioning to a model where ad-supported plans are available in select countries, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter of this year. As a result, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s cheapest ad-free option is now priced at $15.49 per month. This increase in subscription rates can lead to higher number of subscription cancellation, as seen last year. In 2023, data analytics firm Antenna recorded 36.2 million more cancellations compared to the previous year, resulting in 17 million fewer net additions. This indicates that streaming services are facing a greater challenge in acquiring new subscribers despite their continued efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a different note, the music streaming scene in the U.S. has seen substantial evolution over the last decade. Presently, the United States records approximately 90 million paid music streaming subscribers, a significant leap from the mere 7.9 million users in the first half of 2014. Within the competitive realm of music streaming services, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) stands out as the clear frontrunner, holding a commanding 30.5% market share, while its closest competitor, Apple Music, trails with a 13.7% share.\n\nIn light of this, the burgeoning realms of streaming are not merely flourishing; they are fundamentally reshaping the landscape of entertainment and media consumption. The substantial financial implications, characterized by billions in revenue and considerable monthly expenditure on subscriptions, serve as a testament to the economic prowess wielded by these industries. With that in mind, investors looking to take part in this lucrative industry can look towards some of the best streaming service stocks to invest in, which include the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). 10 Best Streaming Service Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by Ashley Byrd on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn this article, we’ve curated a list of the best streaming service stocks based on hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "(Adds details in paragraphs 5 to 10)\n\nBy Jaspreet Singh\n\nApril 25 (Reuters) - Apple has rejected Spotify's new version of its iOS app with in-app pricing information for users in the European Union, the audio streaming firm said on Thursday.\n\nThe Swedish company submitted a new version of its app to Apple with basic pricing and website information, which is a minimum requirement under the European Commission's ruling in its music streaming case, it said in a post on X on Wednesday.\n\nSpotify said Apple rejected its update in a response directly sent to the company.\n\n\"Apple has once again defied the European Commission's decision, rejecting our update for attempting to communicate with customers about our prices unless we pay Apple a new tax. Their disregard for consumers and developers is matched only by their disdain for the law,\" a spokesperson for Spotify said in a statement.\n\nApple said it will approve the new version of the app after Spotify accepts the terms of the Music Streaming Services Entitlement in the European Economic Area (EEA), and resubmit it for review.\n\n\"This entitlement is required even if your app does not include an external link,\" Apple said in a response to Spotify about the app update.\n\nUnder Apple's proposal, Spotify and other streaming services can include links to their websites to inform users of payment options outside its App Store and the company would charge a 27% commission on transactions made through a link.\n\nSpotify did not include the in-app link in the update submitted to Apple.\n\nSpotify said it does not want to be a part of Apple's entitlement as it is a new set of anti-steering restrictions and includes the 27% commission on digital purchases made through links.\n\n\"We are currently assessing whether Apple has fully complied with the decision,\" a spokesperson for the European Commission said, adding the Commission will also assess any changes implemented by Apple to its App Store business terms under the Digital Markets Act.\n\nIn March, Brussels fined Apple with 1.84 billion euros ($1.97 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.

        "content": "(Adds Apple's response in paragraph 8)\n\nKINSHASA, April 25 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo is pushing Apple Inc for more information about its supply chain over concerns it may be tainted with conflict minerals sourced from the country, international lawyers engaged by Congo said on Thursday.\n\nCongo, particularly its eastern region, has been plagued by violence since the 1990s, killing millions as struggles over national identity, ethnicity, and resources saw neighbouring countries invade and a myriad of armed groups spring up.\n\nConflict has arisen over the control of illicit trade in tin and gold as well as in coltan and tantalum - widely used in cell phones and computers - all mined in Congo before being smuggled out through neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.\n\nIn September 2023, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi met with international law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the supply chain of tin, tungsten and tantalum - known as 3T minerals - due to concerns about illegal exports, the law firm said.\n\nIt said it had notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday of a series of questions based on fears about its supply chain and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, requesting answers within three weeks.\n\n\"Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,\" Amsterdam said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda,\" it said.\n\nApple referred Reuters to its latest Conflict Minerals Report.\n\nIt said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).\n\n\"We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the Apple report said.\n\nThe Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.\n\nRwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCongo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.\n\nMost of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.

        "title": "Have $500? 4 Absurdly Cheap Stocks Long-Term Investors Should Buy Right Now",
        "content": "One tried-and-true path to great returns as an investor is to buy shares of strong companies that have fallen out of favor on Wall Street. These businesses are often enduring challenges that threaten the next year or two of earnings, but not the wider growth picture. In that way, you expose yourself to short-term paper losses in exchange for impressive gains over many years. In effect, you're being paid to be patient.\n\nOf course, many stocks are cheap for reasons that do impair the company's long-term growth prospects. The challenge is to avoid these situations while singling out the truly temporary corporate stumbles. Let's look at a few attractive candidates that fit the bill.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) stock missed most of the pandemic-era rally in 2021 and then was left out of the post-pandemic market surge over the past year. As a result, shares of the beverage titan have risen by just 24% in the past five years compared to the 73% increase in the S&P 500 over that time.\n\nYet, Coke remains a formidable business with sales volumes rising along with prices in 2023. Earnings are stellar and profit margin is well above that of rival PepsiCo. The company generates enough cash to pay one of the most stable, longest-running dividends on the market.\n\nAnd its growth prospects are solid as rising demand for waters, energy drinks, and other new niches offset declines in the more traditional soda portfolio.\n\n2. Electronic Arts\n\nElectronic Arts(NASDAQ: EA) is playing a game that's stacked in its favor. The video game publisher owns a huge collection of intellectual property that spans popular niches like sports and casual games. Steady growth in its audience size (and monetization rates) has helped annual revenue rise to $8 billion from less than $4 billion a decade ago.\n\nGames are becoming more profitable as the selling model shifts to more of a software-as-a-service approach. EA is a leader in this arena, with subscription services accounting for 70% of annual sales. Wall Street is worried about slowing growth following the pandemic spike, but savvy investors can look past that volatility toward EA's much brighter potential in 2025 and beyond.\n\n3. McDonald's\n\nFears about a recent growth slowdown should have investors salivating at the discounted price of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) stock. The fast-food chain noted that customer traffic dropped into negative territory at the start of 2024, which is never great news for a restaurant business. Fewer guests means fewer opportunities to sell new menu items or those core sandwiches (like the Big Mac) that have been staples for decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's has been through many similar challenges in its years sitting at the top of the fast-food industry. It will emerge from this slump, too, with help from promotions and a deeper push into the drive-thru and home delivery segments.\n\nIn the meantime, investors can collect its tasty dividend payment and marvel at McDonald's industry-leading profit margin. The chain is aiming to push operating profit toward 50% of sales over the next few years, in fact.\n\n4. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares haven't budged in the past year even as the wider market rallied over 20%. There's no shortage of concerns about this member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" including sluggish growth in China, flat demand for its hardware products, and relatively weak profitability when compared to rivals like Microsoft.\n\nIt would be a mistake to bet against the iPhone maker over the long term. It has the biggest installed base in the industry, with 2.2 billion users interacting with its brand through the tech titan's hardware. That's a huge audience it can market to for its next several product launches, whether they're iterative updates or revolutionary entries into new categories.\n\nApple looks cheap at its current valuation sitting below 7 times annual sales. Toss in ample cash generation ($40 billion just this past quarter), and you've got a recipe for crisp investor returns from here.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Apple (AAPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $89.99 billion, down 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Apple?\n\nFor Apple, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.93%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Apple will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Apple would post earnings of $2.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.18, delivering a surprise of +4.31%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nApple appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Congo questions Apple over knowledge of conflict minerals in its supply chain",
        "content": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Congo ’s government is questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” from a conflict zone in the African country that could be smuggled into its supply chains and is demanding answers within three weeks.\n\nA group of international lawyers representing Congo said Thursday that they sent letters to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and its French subsidiary this week, raising concerns about human rights violations involving the minerals extracted from mines in the country’s troubled east that might end up being used in the company’s products. They included a list of questions challenging Apple to show how it monitors its supply chains in a region where more than 100 armed rebel groups operate, some of whom have been accused of carrying out mass killings of civilians.\n\nWriting to Cook, the lawyers said “it has become clear to us that year after year, Apple has sold technology made with minerals sourced from a region whose population is being devastated by grave violations of human rights.”\n\n\"The iPhones, Mac computers and accessories that Apple sells to its customers around the world rely on supply chains that are too opaque, and that are tainted by the blood of the Congolese people,\" the lawyers said.\n\nEastern Congo is one of the most mineral-rich regions in the world but is also the site of a huge humanitarian disaster, with the armed groups fighting for years for control of the mines and the valuable minerals in them, and millions of people displaced and affected by worsening violence. The situation has deteriorated badly in the last few months.\n\nApple’s press representatives in Europe didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple, which has a market value of around $2.6 trillion, has denied using minerals from mines and regions where human rights violations take place and says it conducts business ethically. It said in a 2023 report that it “responsibly” sources minerals in Congo and its neighboring countries.\n\nThe minerals it buys don't finance war or armed groups, it says. The lawyers for the Congo government said “those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence.”\n\nThe Congo government said it has suspicions that some of the tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as the 3TG critical minerals — that Apple sources from suppliers is smuggled out of Congo to neighboring Rwanda and then infiltrated into the global supply chain. The 3TG minerals are key components in electronics.\n\nCongo has accused Rwanda of financing and directing the notorious armed rebel group M23 in eastern Congo to help extract minerals illegally.\n\nStory continues\n\nRwanda denies that but tensions between the countries are increasingly high, while M23 and other groups are accused of regularly carrying out attacks that include the killing and raping of civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe lawyers for the Congo government quoted a 2022 report by the nongovernmental organization Global Witness that claimed Apple had previously applied “few meaningful mitigation measures” to avoid using smuggled minerals.\n\nThe Congo government was now seeking “effective redress” against “end-users of blood minerals” across the world, the lawyers said.\n\nThey asked Apple to respond to questions over its supply chain controls within three weeks and said they had compiled a report on “the laundering” of Congo's minerals by Rwanda and private entities that would be made public this month.\n\nThey also would seek instructions from the Congo government as to what legal measures it is considering against Apple, the letter said.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Apple analyst warns Vision Pro demand fell much faster than Tim Cook was anticipating",
        "content": "Three months since the Vision Pro mixed reality headset went on sale, Apple’s first new hardware device in years may already be running into headwinds.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with connections into its Asian supply chain, wrote on Tuesday that his channel checks with component manufacturers reveal that the tech giant is grealty tempering its expectations and now expects to sell between 400,000 and 450,000 units this year.\n\n“Demand in the U.S. market has fallen sharply beyond expectations,” he posted to Medium, adding the market consensus had been between 700,000 and 800,000.\n\nSince Apple doesn’t publish a forecast for Vision Pro sales, and did not respond to a Fortune request for comment, it’s difficult to verify his claims.\n\nHowever, the viral excitement surrounding Vision Pro's launch in early February and its claim of launching a \"new era of spatial computing\" have tempered considerably.\n\nFirst time I tried Vision Pro: Damn this display is amazing and the eye tracking is like magic and this feels very future and also it’s a little heavy\n\nSecond time: immersion factor is still so high. Special videos are hit or miss, you gotta get the distance right. And wow this… https://t.co/iqSvs1e8LD\n\n— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) January 16, 2024\n\nGarry Tan, CEO of Silicon Valley’s best-known startup accelerator Y Combinator, posted on Wednesday about his frustration with using Vision Pro while working.\n\n“Do people at Apple actually even dogfood this?” he wrote, using a tech industry term for developers testing out their own products.\n\nIf Apple loses a tech expert like Tan, then, to borrow his words, “it’s not going well.”\n\nThe XR space is struggling to gain mainstream traction\n\nThe field of extended reality (XR), an umbrella term encompassing all forms of the technology including MR and VR, has struggled to carve out a niche for itself beyond the very earliest adopters.\n\nThe gains headsets provide have not been sufficient for mainstream buyers to justify the steep upfront cost of purchasing a Sony PlayStation VR or Meta Quest.\n\nAs long as interest was muted, third-party developers were often hesitant to invest the extra resources to design even ported applications and software, let alone bespoke ones that would fully exploit the hardware’s capabilities.\n\nAnd as long as there was no compelling content they couldn’t already find elsewhere, consumers had little reason to care.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for the Quest, formerly sold under the Oculus brand, has been so tepid compared to the $45 billion in accumulated metaverse losses that Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg decided to license his operating software to other headset manufacturers to spur growth of the overall XR ecosystem.\n\nIt was hoped that Apple, with its instant brand recognition and enormous market influence, would end the chicken-and-egg dilemma that has long handicapped the industry.\n\nThis is crazy:\r\nNew Vision Pro app releases have plummeted...\n\nWe always talk about the \"chicken or the egg\" problem for XR apps & hardware...\n\n...it does not appear that the AVP v1 (aka dev kit) has ignited the XR app ecosystem as we might have hoped pic.twitter.com/4JpHE56aEz\n\n— Troy Kirwin (@tkexpress11) April 17, 2024\n\nBut the device has been criticized for being excessively expensive and uncomfortable—YouTube reviewer Marques Brownlee emphasized three times how heavy it is.\n\nIn a worrying signal that Apple has not yet succeeded in convincing people that developing tools for their headset is worth the effort, data indicates the cadence of new releases for Vision Pro apps is also steadily dropping.\n\n“The challenge for Vision Pro is to address the lack of key applications, price, and headset comfort without sacrificing the see-through user experience,” Apple analyst Kuo warned.\n\nThere was some silver-lining news, however.\n\nEven as Meta forecast on Wednesday that annual operating losses at its Reality Labs segment would increase “meaningfully” year over year as it keeps investing, it said divisional sales jumped by nearly a third thanks to sales of Quest headsets.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Apple has rejected Spotify's new version of its iOS app with in-app pricing information for users in the European Union, the audio streaming firm said on Thursday.\n\nThe Swedish company submitted a new version of its app to Apple with basic pricing and website information, which is a minimum requirement under the European Commission's ruling in its music streaming case, it said in a post on X on Wednesday.\n\nSpotify said the Cupertino, California based-Apple rejected its update in a response directly sent to the company.\n\nApple and the European Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n\"Apple has once again defied the European Commission's decision, rejecting our update for attempting to communicate with customers about our prices unless we pay Apple a new tax. Their disregard for consumers and developers is matched only by their disdain for the law,\" a spokesperson for Spotify said in a statement.\n\nIn March, Brussels fined Apple with 1.84 billion euros ($1.97 billion) for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store, marking its first ever EU antitrust penalty, following a 2019 complaint from Spotify.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple also announced measures that would let music streaming apps on its App Store in the European Economic Area to inform users of other ways to purchase digital services, as it looks to comply with a European Union mandate.\n\nUnder Apple's proposal, Spotify and other streaming services can include link to their websites to inform users of payment options outside its App Store. However, Spotify said in the new version submitted to Apple it did not include the in-app link.\n\n($1 = 0.9328 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Stocks to Sell Now Before the Next Market Downturn Hits",
        "content": "After leading the market higher coming out of the 2022 bear market, technology stocks have hit a rough patch. Sentiment towards the mega-cap tech companies has also shifted, as it now looks like interest rates will remain higher for longer.\n\nAt the same time, geopolitical instability and spiking bond yields have zapped investors’ risk appetite. Throw in hit-and-miss earnings reports and shifting consumer habits, and you have the makings of a downturn.\n\nIn the last month, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 5%, with much of that decline coming since April 11. Some tech stocks have been hit worse than others, as signs emerge that their business may be slowing or the outlook for the remainder of the year has changed.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWall Street appears to be bracing for more downside ahead, with some analysts calling for a full-blown 10% market correction. In this rapidly evolving environment, investors should reposition their portfolio and batten down the hatches.\n\nHere are three tech stocks to sell now before the next market downturn hits.\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) fell after the maker of semiconductor-design software issued forward guidance that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Disappointing guidance is starting to become a theme at Cadence Design, which did the same thing in January of this year, sending its share price lower. CDNS stock is now up about 6% on the year, lagging the performance of many other semiconductor stocks.\n\nThe weak guidance is particularly frustrating, given that Cadence Design Systems consistently beats Wall Street expectations in its quarterly earnings. The company reported first quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.17, which was better than the $1.13 expected among analysts. Revenue in Q1 totaled $1 billion, which was inline with forecasts. Cadence Design also said that it ended Q1 with a record backlog of $6 billion in orders.\n\nDespite the earnings beat and record orders, management once again provided guidance below analysts’ expectations. The company now projects revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion for the current second quarter, with earnings of $1.20 to $1.24 per share. Analysts had been looking for Q2 revenue of $1.10 billion and $1.43 a share in earnings. The weak outlook makes Cadence Design Systems a tech stock to sell.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nDon’t mess with the subscriber numbers. That was the takeaway from the Q1 print of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The streaming giant’s stock fell 10% after management announced that they will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the leadership team said they are stopping the reporting of subscriber numbers, as they want investors to focus instead on metrics such as revenue, operating margins and free cash flow. That news did not go over well with investors.\n\nMore than a few analysts said the move is a red flag and a sign that subscriber growth is slowing at the world’s largest movie and TV streaming platform. Subscriber numbers have always been a way for analysts and investors to compare Netflix and its growth to competing streaming services, such as those offered by Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS).\n\nNews that the reporting of subscribers will be ending at Netflix completely overshadowed what was otherwise a strong Q1 print from the company.\n\nWhile NFLX stock is still up about 26% on the year, any signs of slowing subscriber growth are likely to be problematic for the company and its share price moving forward. As such, Netflix looks like a tech stock to sell before the next market downturn hits.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, there are still reasons to like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the long-term outlook for the stock remains largely positive. But in the near-term, things are getting messy.\n\nEach piece of news related to the consumer electronics company seems to be worse than the last. Case in point: Apple’s iPhone sales in China fell 19% during this year’s first quarter, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Another recent report claimed that Q1 iPhone sales in China declined 9.6%.\n\nAt the same time, media reports note that Apple’s senior executives have been selling millions of dollars worth of company stock ahead of the upcoming May 2 Q1 earnings.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock in April. While Apple has said that the stock sales were prearranged, seeing the executive team dump AAPL stock right before earnings as iPhone sales plunge is a bad look. It also puts more of a spotlight on Apple’s upcoming print, which is shaping up to be a make or break moment for the stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "DR Congo presses Apple over minerals supply chain, lawyers say",
        "content": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo is pushing Apple Inc for information about its supply chain over concerns it may be tainted with conflict minerals sourced from the country, international lawyers engaged by Congo said on Thursday.\n\nCongo, particularly its eastern region, has been plagued by violence since the 1990s, killing millions as struggles over national identity, ethnicity, and resources saw neighbouring countries invade and a myriad of armed groups spring up.\n\nConflict has arisen over the control of illicit trade in tin and gold as well as in coltan and tantalum - widely used in cell phones and computers - all mined in Congo before being smuggled out through neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.\n\nIn September 2023, Congo President Felix Tshisekedi met with international law firm Amsterdam & Partners LLP to investigate the supply chain of tin, tungsten and tantalum - known as 3T minerals - due to concerns about illegal exports, the law firm said.\n\nIt said it had notified Apple CEO Tim Cook on Monday of a series of questions based on fears about its supply chain and also wrote to Apple subsidiaries in France, demanding answers within three weeks.\n\n\"Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,\" Amsterdam said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The world's eyes are wide shut: Rwanda's production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda,\" it said.\n\nApple did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. The company, which does not directly purchase, procure or source primary minerals, has been openly auditing its suppliers for several years and publishing its findings.\n\nIn a report last year, it said that 100% of identified smelters and refiners in the supply chain for all applicable Apple products manufactured in 2023 had participated in an independent third-party conflict minerals audit for 3T minerals and gold (3TG).\n\n\"We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country,\" the Apple report said.\n\nThe Amsterdam statement coincided with the release of a report by the law firm accusing Rwanda and private entities of laundering 3T and other conflict minerals from Congo.\n\nRwanda and Congo's governments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nCongo is the world's leading producer of tantalum, followed by Rwanda. It is also the number one producer of copper and cobalt, a key ingredient in electric batteries.\n\nMost of Congo's mineral resources are concentrated in the east, where insecurity has worsened since a rebel group known as the M23 made a major comeback in March 2022.\n\n(Reporting by Sonia Rolley and Ange Kasongo; Additional reporting by Philbert Girinema and Sofia Christensen; Writing by Sofia Christensen;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "If you’re wondering what stocks to sell this quarter, you’re in the right place. Nothing lasts forever, not even stocks. During a 2018 all-hands meeting, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and then CEO Jeff Bezos famously said: “I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.” Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was on the verge of going bankrupt in 1997 before rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) saved the then struggling company with a $150 million investment. History is littered with once famous companies and stocks that no longer exist.\n\nSince the turn of the century, a number of once high-flying stocks have gone the way of the dodo bird. Names such as Blockbuster Video, Pets.com, and Enron, to cite only a few. These companies, and others, failed after losing their competitive edge, being mismanaged or engaging in fraud. So, which stocks are next to disappear? What companies are most in danger of ceasing operations in the near-term. There are plenty of concerns to choose from. Here are seven stocks that could be heading six-feet under.\n\nStocks to Sell: Tilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis producer Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is awash in red ink. The company recently reported a quarterly loss of $105 million and lowered its forward guidance as its sales continue to crumble. The company said that it lost 12 cents a share for the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 29. Revenue totalled $188.3 million. While the latest results were better than a loss of $1.20 billion and revenue of $145.6 million recorded a year earlier, the latest earnings print shows that Tilray Brands remains in financial straits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of guidance, Tilray said that it expects earnings of only $60 million to $63 million for its entire 2024 financial year as its cannabis sales dry up. The newest guidance is down from earlier estimates of $78 million in earnings. Insult to injury, management at Tilray said that they no longer expect positive free cash flow this financial year. TLRY stock continues to slide lower, with the share price dropping 21% after its latest financial results and guidance were made public.\n\nThe stock is now down 97% over the last five years and trading at less than two bucks.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) A white clock indicates it's time to sell.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAside from its association with former president Donald Trump, there’s not much to recommend Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). The company is barely afloat, having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million on just $4.1 million in revenues. Since going public in late March of this year through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, DJT stock has largely collapsed. The share price is currently 60% below its 52-week high and has fallen 50% since March 27 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nComplicating matters is the huge allotment of stock given to former president Trump. In all, Donald Trump’s stake in the media company stands at $4 billion based on the current share price. He owns more than 100 million. The shares that Donald Trump owns are subject to a lock-up period that prevents him from selling them during the first six months following the company going public. But there is speculation that he will sell his stake in the media company as soon as possible. What happens to DJT stock then?\n\nStocks to Sell: Paramount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s never good when board members resign from a company en masse. But that’s what recently happened at Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) when four board directors announced their departure together. Dawn Ostroff, a former Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) executive; Nicole Seligman, former president of Sony Entertainment (NYSE:SONY); Frederick Terrell, an investment banker; and Rob Klieger, an attorney, are each leaving the board. The resignations come as Paramount Global tries to sell itself.\n\nSince the start of the year, Paramount has been involved in aborted merger talks with Warner Bros. Discovery (NYSE:WBD), received a $26 billion all-cash takeover offer from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) that the board declined, and, most recently, entered into exclusive discussions with privately held Skydance Media about a potential takeover or merger. Skydance has entered into a 30-day exclusive negotiating period with Paramount’s board, though a deal is not guaranteed.\n\nIf all goes well, Paramount Global will be purchased, taken private, and its stock delisted. Or, a merged company could survive as different publicly traded entity. What is clear at this point is that Paramount’s future looks tentative at best. PARA stock is down 75% over the last five years, including a 43% decline in the last 12 months.\n\nNordstrom (JWN) Bright red graphic of stock arrow headed sharply downward beside downward bar graph. Stocks to Never Buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nSpeaking of going private, the family behind U.S. department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has created a special committee to evaluate bids aimed at taking the department store chain private. This as the 123-year-old company struggles with a decline in sales as shopping increasingly moves online. Last summer, Nordstrom closed all of its locations in Canada after less than a decade in the country, shutting down multiple outlets following huge liquidation sales.\n\nThe special committee has been set-up to evaluate proposals aimed at taking Nordstrom private, delisting JWN stock in the process. The company has been down this road before. In 2017, private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners came close to taking Nordstrom private but the deal fell through because of a dispute over price. The latest take private action comes after Nordstrom-issued weak guidance for the year ahead amid soft demand, lagging sales, bloated inventory levels, and increasing markdowns.\n\nJWN stock is down 52% over the past five years.\n\nStocks to Sell: GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that video game retailer and meme stock favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) was talking about becoming the “Amazon of gaming.” Such talk has since faded amid a failed turnaround strategy, successive earnings misses, and ongoing share price declines. Despite repeated efforts, GameStop has not managed to move its business online and meaningfully shrink its retail chain of video game stores that are seeing less foot traffic.\n\nAt the end of March, GME stock plunged 18% after the company reported weak financial results for the final quarter of 2023 that included the year-end holiday shopping season. GameStop announced earnings of 22 cents and revenue of $1.79 billion. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of 30 cents per share and sales of $2.05 billion. Hardware and accessories sales fell 12% year-over-year while software sales declined 31% in the quarter. The company’s sales have steadily eroded as consumers purchase games online.\n\nThe newest turnaround plan will see GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen invest the company’s excess cash in stocks and cryptocurrencies, a move that has made more than a few analysts and investors cringe. In the last 12 months, GME stock has fallen 49%, including a 39% pullback so far in 2024.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Smartphone with logo of Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth Corporation on screen in front of web page. Cannabis plants are in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nCanopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) is another cannabis producer that is in dire straits and has landed itself on this stocks to sell list. In recent months, the company has sold its corporate headquarters, issued more stock to raise money, and placed part of its business under creditor protection. Canopy Growth’s latest earnings showed a net loss of $216.8 million. That compares with a net loss of $264.4 million a year earlier. Revenue for what was the company’s fiscal third quarter totalled $78.5 million, down 8% from $84.9 million a year earlier.\n\nCanopy Growth continues to struggle with declining sales and a loss of market share. Over the past five years, CGC stock has plunged 98%. Last December, the company executed a reverse stock split to artificially raise its share price. The company consolidated its shares on a one-for-10 basis on Dec. 15. Reverse stock splits are, rightfully, seen by markets as an act of desperation by companies that are trying to artificially boost their share price, often to avoid being delisted from a stock exchange, in this case the Nasdaq.\n\nExpress (EXPRQ) Photo of stair of coins with red arrow headed downward over top of the coin stacks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pla2na\n\nClothing retailer Express (OTC:EXPRQ), a fixture at American shopping malls, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to close more than 100 stores. The company, whose portfolio of brands includes Bonobos and UpWest Express, listed assets of $1 billion against liabilities of $10 billion in its bankruptcy filing. As part of the bankruptcy process, the company is closing 95 Express retail stores and about a dozen UpWest stores. In all, the company operates 530 Express retail and Express Factory Outlet stores nationwide.\n\nIn business since 1980, Express has struggled with slowing consumer spending and a shift to online shopping. The company said that it has received a commitment for $35 million in new financing from existing lenders and plans to conduct business as usual while it goes through a restructuring process. Privately held brand management firm WHP Global, which owns fashion label Anne Klein, took a 7.4% stake in Express last year. But to look at the stock price, it appears to be only a matter of time for Express.\n\nThis year alone, EXPRQ stock has fallen 90% and now trades deep down on the penny stock league tables, making it one of those stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Pricier than the rest of Samsung’s range, the dearth of Galaxy S24 Ultra and other S24 devices shows the spending power of the more affluent Pakistani consumers. The world’s fifth-most populous nation, Pakistan has 192 million mobile phone users.\n\n“Samsung Electronics is working hard to meet the demand of our customers, and we anticipate sales will resume shortly,” the South Korean maker of chips, gadgets and appliances said in an emailed statement.\n\nFinancial incentives from the government have shifted Pakistan’s smartphone industry from mostly importing overseas-made products in 2017 to domestic assembly of the vast majority of new handsets sold. Mobile companies produced about 21 million units in Pakistan last year — led by local and Chinese brands VGOTEL, Infinix and Itel — while another 1.7 million units were imported, data from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority show.\n\nThe country’s mobile phone assembly is set to grow by 30% to 40% this year, according to Muzzaffar Hayat Piracha, chief executive officer of Air Link Communication Ltd.

Pakistan’s mobile companies are coming out of a turbulent phase after they had to halt operations last year when the nation restricted imports amid an economic crisis.\n\nRead more: Samsung Bets on Google-Powered AI Features in Smartphone Revamp\n\nThe new models are key to Samsung securing its spot as the world’s biggest smartphone maker. The company lost that title to Apple Inc. and the iPhone last year, which was the first time since 2010 that it wasn’t top of the ranking, per data from industry tracker IDC.\n\nMost phone stores in Pakistan still carry large posters of the S24 series, but are waiting for new stock to arrive.\n\nIn Pakistan, Samsung has an edge on Apple with better pricing and distribution. Because Apple doesn’t do local manufacturing, iPhone buyers have to pay a tax — added for imported handsets — of as much as $650, more than a third of the phone’s official price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender Big Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner Studio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets Pharma Startup Uses AI to Test Old Drugs to Treat Rare Diseases\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo’s government notified Apple Inc. of concerns that the company’s supply chain may be tainted by conflict minerals sourced from the central African nation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden’s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows Malaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City Zuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta’s AI Push Spooks Investors Taylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken BHP Makes Takeover Approach For Rival Miner Anglo American\n\nA group of international lawyers engaged on behalf of the Congolese state sent a list of questions to the US tech giant on April 22 and demanded answers within three weeks, according to a statement published on the website of lawyer Robert Amsterdam on Thursday. The statement coincided with the release by the law firm of a report accusing neighboring Rwanda of laundering tin, tungsten, tantalum — known as 3T minerals — and gold from Congo.\n\nRead More: Rwandan Meddling Is Deepening Congo’s Deadly Conflict\n\n“Although Apple has affirmed that it verifies the origins of minerals it uses to manufacture its products, those claims do not appear to be based on concrete, verifiable evidence,” Amsterdam said. “The world’s eyes are wide shut: Rwanda’s production of key 3T minerals is near zero, and yet big tech companies say their minerals are sourced in Rwanda.”\n\nApple, which is known for rigidly policing its sprawling supply chain, has addressed accusations surrounding conflict minerals for years. The company disclosed back in 2016 that it began fully auditing its suppliers for the use of minerals linked to violent militia groups.\n\nThe US firm, which uses the minerals in its iPhones and other devices, referred a request for comment to a March filing in which the company said it was reasonably confident that none of its suppliers of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold financed or otherwise benefited armed groups in the region, though it did remove 14 smelters and refiners that didn’t participate in an audit.\n\nIt also pledged to source “responsibly” and work to improve working conditions among mining communities, including in Congo.\n\nRwanda’s government didn’t respond to a request for comment sent by text message. The East African nation is the world’s largest producer of tantalum after Congo, according to the US Geological Society. It also has deposits of tin ore and tungsten ore.\n\nEastern Congo has been wracked by violence since the mid-1990s in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. Dozens of rebel groups are active in the region, fighting over land, economic resources and ethnic disputes. The conflict has displaced at least six million people.\n\nStory continues\n\nRwandan President Paul Kagame has long denied that his country benefits from what Congo claims is the $1 billion a year it loses from the smuggling of gold and other minerals through its eastern neighbor. United Nations experts also accuse elements of Congo’s own army of profiting from the illicit trade in minerals from the region.\n\nThe US and European Union have laws discouraging companies from purchasing minerals linked to the conflict.\n\nCongo government spokesman Patrick Muyaya confirmed it had hired the team of lawyers.\n\n--With assistance from Edwin Chan, Loni Prinsloo, Michael J.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook toured Southeast Asia last week, visiting Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, as part of a multiday trip geared toward reducing Apple’s reliance on China as its central manufacturing hub.\n\nAnd while Apple isn’t looking to abandon China — Cook spent a number of days in the country just last month — the company is hedging against the potential for future manufacturing roadblocks in the region.\n\nAt the same time, the company is slowly setting its sights on India as its next major growth opportunity now that China has become a more mature smartphone market.\n\n“Apple is in the beginning stages of a decade[-long] transition away from reliance on China and diversify that to other countries in Southeast Asia on both the manufacturing front and the demand front,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBut reducing Apple’s dependence on China for building its devices and growing its market share could take some time.\n\nManufacturing growth beyond China\n\nChina accounts for a disproportionate amount of Apple’s supply chain partners such as Foxconn and Pegatron. That concentration of manufacturing capacity in one area proved especially damaging during the pandemic when China forced factories to shut down, limiting Apple’s ability to build and ship devices.\n\nOnce capacity came back online, Apple was able to meet consumer demand again. But the fact that a factory closure had such an impact on the company was a troubling sign of fragility in its supply chain.\n\n“Apple basically said they fulfilled about $5 billion of back revenue on the last conference call,” BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told Yahoo Finance. “That's $5 billion for one facility shut down in China.” Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh (R) shakes hands with Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) during a meeting at the Government Office in Hanoi on April 16, 2024. (Photo by Duc Khanduc Khanh/AFP via Getty Images) (DUC KHANHDUC KHANH via Getty Images)\n\nLeft unchecked, that lack of supply chain resiliency could come back to bite Apple again given the gloomy state of the US and China’s relationship and tit-for-tat maneuvers the countries are making with regard to their respective tech companies. The US has tried to box out Huawei from getting access to high-end processors and is working to get ByteDance to sell TikTok, while China is reportedly requiring state employees to ditch devices made by Western companies.\n\n“We see Cupertino going aggressively after [Southeast Asian] countries on the supply front,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Cook is hedging his bets as China remains a very dicey situation for Apple while Vietnam and Indonesia are soft landing spots for iPhone production.”\n\nApple’s problems in China extend beyond manufacturing complexities. The company is also contending with a slowdown in iPhone sales in the region as economic growth flags and regional rivals grab market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nGreater China is Apple’s third-largest market by revenue behind the Americas and Europe. But iPhone sales in the region are slowing. In Q1, Apple reported revenue in Greater China fell 13% year over year, and that’s after falling 2% for all of 2023. Apple previously reported 9% growth in the region in 2022.\n\nChina is also a relatively mature smartphone market, making massive growth gains a difficult proposition, which is where India comes in.\n\nIndia as the next China\n\nThe most populous country in the world, India has a growing middle class that could prove to be a boon for Apple.\n\n“China took probably five years before it really mattered,” Munster explained. “India probably takes 10 years, and the reason is they've got the population on their side, but the GDP per capita is about a quarter in India what it is in China. And so just in general, people don't have … the same wealth in India as they do in China.”\n\nApple opened its first official store in India last year, with Cook himself kicking off the festivities for the Mumbai location. Apple also builds some of its latest iPhones in the country, making it even more important for the company. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmerging markets like India are going to be key to Apple’s growth in the coming years, as its larger markets continue to mature and growth declines. The company has been telegraphing that much as well. In earnings calls, executives repeatedly point to emerging markets as growth areas during earnings calls, with Tim Cook specifically pointing to the likes of India and other growth markets in his opening remarks during Apple’s Q1 call.\n\nStill, Apple’s push to expand its manufacturing and market share outside of China will take years. So, for the foreseeable future, the company will have to continue to rely on China and figure out how to make the best of it.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of growth stocks and how they relate to the current stock market environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.\n\nAs the first quarter of 2024 is behind us, the stock market is also presenting a changed environment. The first quarter saw an extension of the themes that were in play during Q4 2023. It saw artificial intelligence and technology stocks continue to post gains, as investors were not only convinced that AI held great potential when it came to consumer and business use cases, but also that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates multiple times this year.\n\nHowever, with Q2 now officially underway, investor expectations for a robust economic environment to pile vast sums of money into the stock market have now shifted. Part of this is due to fresh economic data that shows that despite the fact that it is significantly down from the highs of 2022, inflation is still higher than what the Federal Reserve would like to observe. Consequently, major stock indexes such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite have dialed down some of their gains as Wall Street starts to enter a 'wait and watch' phase.\n\nFor instance, while the S&P 500 made news in 2024 for crossing the 5,000 point mark for the first time in its history, it ended up losing more than 4% of these gains during the second and third week of April 2024 after the inflation data for March 2024 was released. Similarly, the tech heavy NASDAQ Comp fell by 7% during the same time period and recovered some of these gains later on.\n\nHow does this relate to growth stocks? Well, the macroeconomic factors that have contributed to the illustrious stock indexes shedding their gains are also ones that do not bode well for growth stocks. One of the most commonly accepted definitions of a growth stock is a firm whose price bakes in a significant premium over the earnings per share. This premium is measured through the price to earnings ratio, which is also evaluated along with the industry average to see whether the high multiple is an industry trend or an exception.\n\nGrowth stocks are also some of the most highly sought ones on Wall Street since investing for most people is all about making money by watching share prices grow. Some of the best known growth stocks of our times have transformed industries and made history in their respective industries. Two such examples are the semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). AMD's shares are up by a whopping 445% over the past five years, showing that those investors with the correct insights about the semiconductor industry who had the foresight to buy the shares in 2019 would be significantly better off now. So why have AMD's shares soared? The answer to this question lies in the nature of the semiconductor industry and the prowess of the firm's CEO Dr. Lisa Su. The nature of the chip sector means that not every company can sell x86 microprocessors. In fact, most such processors are made by the chip behemoth Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and AMD's success has been due to its ability to capture market share from the larger rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has soared because it became the first company in the world to make and ship electric vehicles on scale. Its share price percentage gain over the past five years is double of AMD's and currently sits at 823%. But is Tesla still a growth stock? Here's what Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC had to say about the firm as part of its Q4 2023 investor letter for the Large Cap Growth Strategy fund:\n\nTesla contributed to portfolio performance in the fourth quarter due to our underweight position relative to the growth index. Tesla reported disappointing third quarter earnings in mid-October in part, due to downtime at some factories that were being upgraded. The CEO expressed concern that higher interest rates were impacting demand for automobiles and would not comment on growth expectations for 2024. However, the expected scale production of the Cybertruck is 12 to 18 months in the future which we believe will negatively impact short-term growth.\n\nSo, which growth stocks might be great picks for 2024? Some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and read below for more: 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024\n\nA close-up of an investor pointing to a chart featured on a projector, conveying a message of growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top growth stocks, we ranked the holdings of the Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top growth stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best growth stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "title": "Steve Jobs Spent 'Hour After Hour' On Product Design — 'He Cared About God Being In The Details,' Says Walter Isaacson",
        "content": "Steve Jobs dedicated “hour after hour” to the minutiae of product design at Apple Inc., driven by a belief of “God being in the details,” according to esteemed biographer Walter Isaacson, chronicler of some of the most influential figures in technology.\n\nThis philosophy was evident in Jobs’s hands-on involvement in creating iconic Apple products. Isaacson noted how Jobs's obsession with design extended to every aspect of a product, even those components that consumers would never see. This approach wasn't just about aesthetics; for Jobs, the care put into the unseen parts of a product was a testament to the integrity and quality of the entire creation.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nJoin the elite. Invest in Epic Games and own a piece of the $17 billion Fortnite empire. This ‘Future of Gaming’ startup disrupting a $272 billion industry is now letting anyone invest for a limited time.\n\nDuring an interview posted on YouTube, Isaacson highlighted Jobs’s sessions in Apple’s design studio, where he would scrutinize everything from the curvature of a computer’s casing to the layout of internal components.\n\nJobs believed that true excellence in product design required a relentless pursuit of perfection, down to the smallest detail. This could mean countless revisions and discussions, often pushing his team to their limits but also driving them to innovate in ways they never thought possible.\n\nJobs's detailed-oriented methodology set a new standard in the tech industry, emphasizing the importance of design in product development. His legacy, detailed by Isaacson, shows a leader who demanded the best and deeply understood the elements that would appeal to users, both aesthetically and functionally.\n\nTrending: Invest alongside execs from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\n\nThis detail-oriented approach to products helped make Apple into the powerhouse it is today. In its early days, Apple was dedicated to innovation, with the near-flawless design of the iPhone and iPad going largely unchanged since their inception over a decade ago. Although some now accuse Apple of incrementalism, it's hardly impacted the company and leaves opportunities for new and exciting startups to take the helm.\n\nIsaacson’s observations offer a window into Jobs’s mind, revealing how his focus on details was integral to Apple’s success. This approach led to groundbreaking products like the iPhone and MacBook, which seamlessly blend functionality with sleek, minimalist design.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough Isaacson’s narrative, it becomes clear that Jobs’s insistence on perfection in every aspect of design was not just about making products that looked good, but about creating devices that offer a revolutionary user experience, fundamentally changing how people interact with technology.\n\nJobs’s legacy, as articulated by Isaacson, is a reminder of the importance of detail in crafting products that are both functional and transformative. His philosophy continues to influence Apple and the broader tech industry, perpetuating a culture where design and detail are paramount.\n\nKeep Reading About Startups:\n\nInvest like a millionaire.

        "title": "3 Underperforming U.S. Stocks With Big China Upside",
        "content": "The Chinese economy has been in a bit of a rough patch for quite some time now, with numerous Chinese tech titans still stuck in their massive multi-year ruts. Even the U.S. companies that do a significant amount of business in China have been feeling the harsh economic realities. Add the potential for geopolitical risks into the equation, and it can feel tempting to steer clear of the companies that may depend too much on the region to fuel their long-term revenue growth.\n\nThat said, there is hope, with China starting the year with 5.3% growth in the first quarter. For those willing to bet on a Chinese economic rebound, I view the U.S. companies with exposure to the region as great plays.\n\nLonger-term investors seeking low-cost growth may find ample value in buying some Chinese-exposed U.S. firms while they’re down and out. Here are three underperforming U.S. stocks that could benefit greatly once China’s economy finally has a chance to bounce back.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChinese consumers seem to have a newfound thirst for coffee. Indeed, tea has nothing on coffee when it comes to getting a nice caffeinated jolt to start one’s day. China has seen robust growth in cafés in recent years, with the nation now boasting more branded coffee shops than America, a fact I found quite surprising.\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the branded coffee kingpin that’s done a good job of expanding into China in recent years. However, the Chinese coffee boom has also paved the way for national competitors. In any case, growth out of China could be key to boosting SBUX stock to new highs over the next few years.\n\nIn the meantime, Starbucks has no shortage of problems, as budget-constrained consumers pull back on fancy Frappuccinos for homemade brews. As inflation dies down and Starbucks continues opening new shops across China, I view shares as having a pathway out of the gutter under its new top boss Laxman Narasimhan.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another company that could rocket higher once the Chinese economy kicks into high gear. With China’s economy off to a decent start to the year, the world’s second-largest economy may very well be in a spot to make up for lost time in the quarters ahead. That could spell great things for Apple as it looks to gain ground in the region again.\n\nWith Chinese smartphone rivals, like Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACY) and Huawei, beginning to pick up speed, many wonder if Apple still has what it takes to capitalize on next-level growth out of China. Earlier this year, Apple reportedly offered a rare discount on its latest iPhone to bolster sales growth in China. However, only time will tell how the iPhone will stack up against domestic competitors over the year ahead.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think it’s a mistake to discount Apple’s ability to return to glory once the Chinese economy is back up to full speed. At the end of the day, the iPhone is a premium device, one that could experience more explosive demand when Chinese consumers have more disposable income.\n\nEven if growth in China stalls for longer, Apple still stands to do well as it begins to share more about its long-term AI strategy with the world. With intriguing AI products (AI PCs and phones rumored to be on the way) and software updates in the pipeline, AAPL has plenty of growth drivers to jolt its stock.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have luxury goods maker LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY), which found itself plunging around 11% off its year-to-date highs. With sales growth coming in soft as a result of lower demand for luxury goods in China, the stock seems destined for lower lows as its most exciting growth market feels a bit of a pinch.\n\nI view the slip in LMVH stock as a terrific buying opportunity for investors seeking to ride the next Chinese economic recovery. Undoubtedly, luxury demand is bound to swing wildly based on the health of the economy. But when the tides finally do turn, they could do so drastically. For now, it’s unclear as to when luxury demand will start making a move to peak levels. Regardless, LVMH will be there to meet pent-up demand when the time comes.\n\nAt 26.6 times trailing P/E, the stock looks way too cheap, given after the latest round of turbulent action. Undoubtedly, China is becoming an increasingly important growth market for LVMH as it looks to capitalize on the nation’s rising middle class. Even as demand sags, I have no doubt that LVMH will continue increasing its Asian store count at a steady pace over the next few years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

        "title": "Apple has its worst China quarter since 2020 as Huawei’s resurgence eats into its market share, says new research",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo dismissed Huawei's new 5G smartphone over the weekend as having \"not nearly as good\" a processor as what's available in the U.S. But there's one thing the U.S-blacklisted company's new phone may be really good at: taking sales from Apple.\n\nThe quiet launch of Huawei's Mate 60 Pro is transforming China's phone market as consumers shift to local brands. Apple's shipments tumbled 19% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, the company's worst performance since 2020, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe U.S. company now has market share of around 15.7%, down from 19.7% a year ago. The drop puts Apple in third place in China's smartphone market, behind Vivo and HONOR.\n\nApple's decline contrasts with Huawei's rise. The Chinese smartphone maker's sales in the first quarter of 2024 jumped by almost 70%. It now has 15.5% of China's phone market, putting it just behind Apple. Counterpoint partly attributed Huawei's growth to the company's 5G smartphone, giving the tech giant \"a massive share in the $600+ premium segment.\"\n\nHONOR, a former Huawei subsidiary spun off in 2020, is in second place after its sales grew 11.5% year-on-year.\n\nApple led the Chinese smartphone market for 2023 as a whole, ahead of Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi, according to Counterpoint data,\n\nFierce competition in China helped to knock Apple from its perch as the top global seller of smartphones last quarter, according to an IDC report released last week. South Korea's Samsung is now in first place.\n\nHuawei's rise\n\nChinese consumers could be attracted by the price of Huawei's 5G phone, which is cheaper than Apple's iPhone. But Chinese media also promoted the Mate 60 Pro, which features a domestically-produced advanced chip, as a source of national pride upon its launch last year.\n\nHuawei sold 1.6 million Mate 60 Pro handsets in the six weeks following its launch, and sales have remained strong since.\n\nA resurgent Huawei is just one of the challenges to Apple's business in China. The iPhone maker is dealing with greater regulatory scrutiny: Beijing reportedly told government officials and employees at state-owned enterprises to stop using iPhones, and regulators ordered Apple to remove several foreign programs, like WhatsApp, Threads and Signal, from its China app store last week on \"national security concerns.\"\n\nApple is also trying to diversify its supply chain to rely less on Chinese suppliers. CEO Tim Cook made a whirlwind visit to Southeast Asia last week which may have been an effort to \"hedge [Apple's] supply chain bets,\" analysts previously told Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Non-Gamestop Stocks to Buy for the Future of Gaming",
        "content": "As gaming stocks have a bright future, investors should tap into this industry now while the valuation of these companies are still cheap.\n\nThe global video game market size was valued at approximately $217.06 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is largely driven by advancements in online gaming.\n\nOnline gaming dominates the market, attributed to increased internet penetration and the popularity of massively multiplayer online and free-to-play games.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the industry is seeing a shift towards subscription-based models, with platforms like Xbox Game Pass by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Arcade.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis means that the gaming industry is becoming more lucrative due to some of these firms being evaluated the same as tech stocks are, due to their monthly recurring revenue streams.\n\nWe might be at an inflection point soon when these companies take off. So here are three gaming stocks for investors to consider.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) has proven to be a resilient name in the gaming industry, and it has only just begun to mark its dominance in the industry.\n\nUnlike traditional gaming platforms that rely on a set catalog of games, Roblox allows users to create and monetize their own gaming experiences.\n\nStarting out as a gaming platform for kids, it has since considerably broadened its demographic and expanded its monetization features. This includes the expansion of its developer subscription services and advertising programs, which saw substantial brand engagements with 69 major brands in Q4 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the company is enhancing its platform with new AI-driven features, such as real-time AI chat translation and AI-powered tools for 3D content creation.\n\nGiven how many dedicated communities on Roblox there are and its expanding monthly recurring revenue, Roblox will be in a great position to scale its userbase in the future and reach higher levels of profitability. This then makes it one of those gaming stocks to buy.\n\nUnity Software Inc (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software Inc (NYSE:U) dominates the game engine market, especially for mobile games, and also has significant shares in PC and VR and AR markets.\n\nIt should also be noted that Unity is a popular game engine of indie developers. So, even if one has a less bullish forecast on AAA publishers’ ability to outperform, Unity covers one-man bands, as well as small teams. Mobile gaming is its obvious strength, and VR and AR are strong potential growth areas.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor 2024, Unity is concentrating on expanding its core business areas, including enhancing AI integration within its development tools and launching new multiplayer projects.\n\nUnity 6, a major update, is set to launch in fall 2024, promising improved performance and expanded features for developers. Additionally, Unity Muse, an AI-powered development platform, will be integrated directly into the Unity Editor.\n\nFinally, the consensus price target among analysts is $37.03 for Unity to be reached within the next twelve months, which represents a potential upside of 61.64% from its current price.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) Electronic Arts logo on a wall\n\nSource: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is a major player in video game development and publishing, known for popular titles across various genres like sports, such as FIFA and Madden NFL, first-person shooters and simulation games.\n\nAlthough some committed gamers point out EA’s reputation for rehashing the same games every year, as in the case for its blockbuster sports franchises, combined with the morally debatable practice of loot boxes and pay-to-win dynamics, EA has managed to stand the test of time as a business.\n\nEA also recently adjusted its workforce, reducing it by 6% and implementing restructuring charges expected to range from $170 million to $200 million. This move aligns with broader industry trends — a smaller team in the future is why you should be bullish on EA.\n\nEA forecasts net revenue to range between $7.3 billion and $7.7 billion this year, and net income is projected between $947 million and $1.087 billion. Diluted earnings per share are expected to lie between $3.42 and $3.92. This puts it around the results of last year, but the efficiencies of having a smaller workforce could unlock greater value in the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meet the 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Members of Congress Can't Stop Selling",
        "content": "Within the last month, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and innovation-powered Nasdaq Composite all ascended to fresh highs. While there have been pockets of strength in a variety of sectors and industries, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been widely credited with lifting these major stock indexes to record levels.\n\nPut simply, the Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded businesses in the country. These seven juggernauts are (listed in descending order by market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll seven of these companies have crushed the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing decade. This outperformance is a big reason why investors -- and members of Congress -- have flocked to these businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors (and members of Congress) have historically flocked to the Magnificent Seven\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven are leaders or critical players in their respective industries:\n\nMicrosoft's Windows remains the undisputed leader in global desktop operating systems, while Azure is No. 2 in worldwide cloud infrastructure service spend. Apple's iPhone accounts for more than half of all U.S. smartphone market share. Alphabet's Google was responsible for a 91% share of global internet search in March, while wholly owned streaming service YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) make up a 90% (or greater) share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is No. 1 globally in online retail market share. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services is the worldwide No. 1 in cloud infrastructure service spend. Meta Platforms owns the most sought-after social media real estate, with Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and its other apps collectively attracting almost 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading producer of electric vehicles (EVs), and is the only pure-play EV maker to have achieved recurring profits.\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive advantages, the \"Congressional Trading 2023\" report from Unusual Whales shows that select lawmakers on Capitol Hill have sent three Magnificent Seven stocks to the chopping block.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 Congress is selling: Nvidia\n\nAlthough Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her venture capitalist husband have made a small fortune purchasing call options in the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, when it comes to the purchasing and selling of common shares, members of Congress were decidedly sellers of Nvidia stock in 2023. Collectively, $1.76 million shares were sold by lawmakers last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe biggest seller of all, according to data from Capitol Trades, has been House Rep. Dan Meuser (R-PA). Between May 5, 2023 and Aug. 14, 2023, five sell orders were executed for Meuser, ranging from just $1,000 to $15,000, up to a sell order of $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nAside from simple profit-taking, there are three key reasons shares of Nvidia may be headed notably lower.\n\nTo start with, every next-big-thing investment trend since the advent of the internet 30 years ago has worked its way through an early innings bubble. Investors have a tendency to overestimate the uptake and adoption of new innovations, and AI is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nSecondly, Nvidia has the potential to cannibalize its own pricing power in the coming quarters. The scarcity of its in-demand GPUs drove the price of its A100 and H100 chips into the stratosphere last year. As Nvidia brings more production to market, and new competitors enter the space, GPU scarcity will decline. In turn, Nvidia's gross margin should retrace.\n\nThe third issue, which I believe is Nvidia's biggest hurdle, is that its top four customers (Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet) are all developing in-house GPUs of their own. These Magnificent Seven components account for roughly 40% of Nvidia's sales, and we're probably witnessing a peak in orders from these industry titans. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 Congress is selling: Microsoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress have been steady sellers of is the largest publicly traded company, Microsoft. Though Microsoft is listed on Unusual Whales' heatmap as one of the most-purchased stocks in 2023 ($1.97 million shares bought by lawmakers), members of Congress collectively sold $11.61 million shares. That's a net of $9.64 million worth of Microsoft shares that were sold last year.\n\nWhereas Nvidia had one notable seller, a number of lawmakers couldn't stop selling shares of Microsoft:\n\nHouse Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) dumped between $1 million and $5 million in shares on Jan. 4, 2023. House Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-WA) sold between $250,000 and $500,000 in shares on both March 1, 2023 and Aug. 30, 2023. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) shed $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Microsoft stock on June 20, 2023. House Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) sold multiple rounds of Microsoft stock that commonly ranged between five-and-six figures throughout 2023.\n\nThe likeliest reason for this selling is simple profit-taking. Shares of the company gained 57% last year, with the company's investments in AI fueling its ascent.\n\nAnother reason lawmakers may have headed for the exit is Microsoft's valuation. Although Microsoft is an absolute cash cow, it ended April 19 at a multiple of nearly 32 times forward-year earnings. For some context, this is about a 10% premium to Microsoft's forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, members of Congress might be concerned about a bubble brewing in the AI space. Microsoft has aggressively invested in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and has been incorporating generative AI solutions into Azure. If history rhymes, once more, and the AI bubble bursts, some of Microsoft's valuation premium may be wiped away.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stock No. 3 Congress is selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that members of Congress can't stop selling is social media maven Meta Platforms. Though Meta doesn't appear on Unusual Whales' heatmap of congressional buying activity, it was one of the most-actively sold communication services providers in 2023, with aggregate selling of $2.6 million.\n\nThe culprit for the lion's share of this selling activity in Meta is Michael McCaul, Congress' second most-active stock trader (1,826 trades completed in 2023). In addition to dumping shares of Microsoft on numerous occasions, McCaul sold shares of Meta 16 times last year, based on data provided by Capitol Trades.\n\nAs with Nvidia and Microsoft, profit-taking is a logical reason why lawmakers headed for the exit in 2023. Meta was one of the top-performing megacap stocks last year, with its AI ties clearly providing a boost.\n\nAnother catalyst that may have encouraged members of Congress to pare down their stakes in Meta is the growing likelihood of a U.S. recession. Select predictive indicators and money-based metrics suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy may not be far off. Meta generated close to 98% of its revenue from advertising in 2023, and businesses aren't shy about reducing their ad spending when trouble arises. Although recessions are short-lived, they could hit Meta harder than other Magnificent Seven components.\n\nThe final factor that may be behind Congress' selling of Meta stock is the increasingly competitive social media landscape. The continued popularity of TikTok serves as formidable competition and could result in weaker ad-pricing power for Facebook, the top social media platform in the world.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe McCaul has made a big mistake parting with his shares of Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best ethical companies to invest in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of ESG stocks, then you can take a look at 5 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024.\n\nThe relationship of the corporate sector with the well-being of the general population is always controversial. On one end, firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) have transformed people's lives and allowed them to improve their health, stay connected, and shop for countless products affordably. On the other end, some of the most controversial companies in the world are among the most valuable as well. The best examples of these are the oil mega giants such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) who are often targeted by environmental activists due to the polluting effects of their products.\n\nBalancing both these factors, i.e. the negative externalities that result from the costs of doing business and the benefits to society of private enterprise, is a field called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). ESG seeks to invest only in those companies that are aware of the impact that their operations make on the environment and are actively working to mitigate this impact. It is a relatively newer phenomenon, and despite its noble objectives, the trend seems to have run into roadblocks as of late.\n\nThis is because the stock market of 2024 is quite different from the 'environment' that was in play in 2018, when ESG investing was gaining traction. In 2018, sustainable investing surged to $30 trillion, as investors forced companies to become more climate conscious and favored those that took the initiative. However, in 2018, interest rates weren't as high as they are right now, and inflation had not yet tasted the impacts of loose monetary policies and global supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn 2024, the stock market and the broader finance industry are still recovering from both of these. While rates are still high and creating constraints for investors to raise capital, inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine has shown that the global oil industry is still quite crucial to economic well being despite the fact that fossil fuels are also some of the biggest polluters on the planet.\n\nTaking a look at recent stats, data from Bloomberg shows that 2023 wasn't a particularly great year for ESG. The ESG market fell to $30.3 trillion in 2023 from $35 trillion at the start of the year, and subsequent data showed that 2023 was the worst year on record for the sector. This data comes from Morningstar Financial and it reveals that during the fourth quarter of 2023, sustainable funds marked their first full year of outflows in a decade. In Q4 alone, a whopping $5 billion went out of these funds, a figure that jumps to $13 billion for the full year. These outflows came on the back of disappointing performance of sustainable equity funds in particular, as Morningstar's data shows that \"32% of sustainable equity funds dropped to the bottom quartile relative to peers.\" This also ensured that the fourth quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where investors preferred sustainable funds when compared to their traditional counterparts.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to the best ethical companies, it's also important to know why ESG and stocks with a focus on the environment and broader business sustainability tend to have shied away from gains as of late. One of the biggest reasons behind this is high interest rates, which means that earning a profit becomes difficult. Therefore, companies that focus on sustainability have to deal with high business costs and have to fund costly projects, which means that investors find a better bang for their buck elsewhere.\n\nOn a final note, here's what Madison Investments had to say about its Madison Sustainable Equity Fund's performance during the fourth quarter of 2023:\n\nEquity markets finished the year on a strong note with the S&P 500 up 11.7% during the fourth quarter, bringing the full year return to 26.3%. The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund (Class Y) returned 11.9% in the fourth quarter but lagged the S&P 500 for the full year, returning 18.0%.\n\nThe strength during the fourth quarter can be attributed to the downward shift of the yield curve. Interest rates dropped during the fourth quarter as inflation moderated and the market began to discount an end to Fed rate hikes and even began discounting interest rate cuts in 2024. Rates rose during the third quarter, with the 2-year Treasury rising to 5.05% and the 10-year moving to 4.58%, its highest level since September 2007. Then in the fourth quarter, the 2-year rate fell to 4.35% and the 10-year fell to 3.94%. Both fixed income and equities rallied in the fourth quarter. The economy is still growing, real GDP grew 4.9% in Q3 and is expected to grow 1.2% in Q4, and 1.3% in 2024. Headline inflation is moderating but remains above the desired 2%. Inflation fell to 3.5% in Q3 and is expected to drop to 3.2% in Q4 with expectations for inflation to fall to 2.6% in 2024. Unemployment remains low at 3.7%, and the consumer continues to spend. However, with Covid savings dwindling and credit card balances rising, we anticipate consumer spending will slow in 2024. The market now expects that the Federal Reserve will cut the Fed Funds rate in 2024. Expectations are for the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter. We continue to expect the Fed to keep rates high until inflation moves closer to 2%, which may not happen until 2025.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top ethical stocks. A couple of top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Ethical Companies to Invest in 2024\n\nA trader at a stock exchange, vigorously watching the stocks' trends in the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best ethical stocks, we ranked the top 30 most valuable holdings of the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 and picked the top stocks.\n\nFor these best ethical stocks, we mentioned hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A rally in tech heavyweights lifted the broader stock market, with the group’s high-stakes earnings seen by Wall Street investors as a major test of the bull run in equities.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken Tech Giants Roar as Tesla Spikes in Late Hours: Markets Wrap Tesla Stock in ‘No Man’s Land’ After 43% Rout Ahead of Earnings Biden’s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn Ray Dalio’s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing\n\nIn late hours, Tesla Inc. soared as the electric-vehicle giant said it will accelerate the launch of more-affordable models — and chief Elon Musk struck an upbeat tone. The stock halted a seven-day plunge that drove it to “oversold” levels, climbing alongside other members of the “Magnificent Seven” cohort of megacaps on Tuesday. Texas Instruments Inc. gave a bullish revenue forecast — a good sign for the chip industry.\n\nTesla Stock Soars on ‘Not as Bad as Feared’ Results: Street Wrap\n\nAfter notching several record highs this year, equities lost traction in the past few weeks amid signals the Federal Reserve will hold rates higher for longer. The slide made stocks more attractive as it removed market froth, with investors now focused on earnings, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists.\n\n“We would view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity,” Citi’s Mihir Tirodkar and Beata Manthey said. “Bullish positioning has unwound and now looks more neutral, particularly in the US. The current earnings season could refocus investor attention on solid underlying fundamentals.”\n\nThe S&P 500 notched its best back-to-back rally in two months. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the artificial-intelligence boom, led a surge in chipmakers. United Parcel Service Inc. — an economic barometer — reported profit that beat estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. closed at an all-time high.\n\nTreasuries briefly extended gains after a solid $69 billion sale of two-year notes — but quickly returned to levels seen ahead of the auction — with 10-year yields little changed.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson said the bar is high for US firms to deliver on earnings, particularly for megacap technology names, which face tough comparisons from the growth they showed last year.\n\nBut more interesting to him will be how shares react to the results.\n\nEquities extended a rebound after a selloff that sent the S&P 500 down over 5% in April through Friday.\n\nThe most-important aspect of the market set-up heading into this week’s earnings was its “oversold” condition, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Thus, if earnings come in strong over the days ahead, stocks are effectively spring-loaded for a bigger counter-trend rally than we have seen thus far,” he said.\n\nBased on the median and average pullbacks, downside from current levels would be limited to somewhere between 2% to 5% — which would also correspond to S&P 500 levels where there’s strong technical support, said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services.\n\n“Pullbacks are the admission price to the market,” he noted. “The weight of the evidence in our work suggests the market’s risk/reward has improved following the recent setback. Therefore, we view the recent pullback as an opportunity for those investors who have excess cash or are underweight equities relative to their target allocations.”\n\nAhead of a busy period of quarterly earnings, Bank of America Corp.’s corporate clients stepped up purchases of their own stock.\n\nBuybacks accelerated in the five-day period through April 19 — and are tracking above typical seasonal levels for the seventh consecutive week — quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote Tuesday in note to clients.\n\nBesides Tesla, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are also due to report earnings this week. And stakes are high.\n\nListen and subscribe to Elon, Inc. on Apple, Spotify, iHeart and the Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nProfits for the “Magnificent Seven” group — which also includes Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Nvidia Corp. — are forecast to rise about 40% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.\n\nThe group of tech megacaps is crucial to the S&P 500 since the companies carry the heaviest weightings in the benchmark. After this year’s advance, valuations have gotten lofty. After the latest selloff, the Magnificent Seven still traded at a combined 31 times forward earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTo Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management, the group will likely be able to extend its positive performance.\n\n“After all, the strong balance sheet characteristics and secure competitive market positions of the Magnificent Seven imply that a significant correction is unlikely, despite their valuations drawing comparisons to the 2000s tech bubble,” she noted.\n\nAnd despite all the macroeconomic fears, tech balance-sheets may shelter the sector from elevated rates, according to BI strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.\n\n“While tech stocks have above-average and median duration relative to the rest of the market, the group also carries relatively little debt and maintains a far superior interest-rate coverage ratio to the rest of the index’s sectors,” they noted.\n\n“Big Tech is carrying S&P 500 earnings growth this quarter, but the other 495 companies in the index will have to come into their own starting in the second quarter,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “Markets clearly believe this will occur, which is why large caps have held in fairly well, even as rates and geopolitical risks have risen.”\n\nBrace for more declines in stock markets, warns Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s tactical specialist Scott Rubner.\n\nAnswering a barrage of questions from clients on whether the pullback in stock markets meant enough equity exposure was reduced last week, Rubner said “my reply is no.” He noted that Goldman clients have been reducing exposure on any uptick in stocks.\n\nGoldman’s trading desk estimates that commodity trading advisers, or CTAs that surf the momentum of asset prices through long and short bets in the futures market, are modeled to sell stocks over the next week, no matter which way markets go.\n\nTo Mark Newton at Fundstrat, the stock rebound doesn’t mean the lows are in — but they look close — and breadth looks to have bottomed out.\n\n“Technology has pulled back to good support, and should stabilize/rally post earnings,” he noted. “Value has taken a temporary lead over growth — which should prove temporary.”\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nVisa Inc. reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street predictions as US credit-card spending climbed. Mattel Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss, benefiting from fast sales of its Hot Wheels miniature cars and lower costs. Apple Inc.’s iPhone sales in China fell 19% during the March quarter, according to data from an independent research firm that marked the gadget’s worst performance there since Covid struck around 2020. Spotify Technology SA reported it swung to a profit in the first quarter as the audio-streaming giant boosted subscribers and added new features. PepsiCo Inc. posted stronger-than-expected sales growth thanks to robust demand in its international divisions, while volumes dropped in North America. Halliburton Co., the world’s biggest provider of fracking work, posted its best earnings for a first quarter in a dozen years despite a shrinking business in the shale patch that it said isn’t likely to recover this year. General Motors Co. expects better profit this year after a strong first quarter, as robust truck sales in the US led the automaker to raise 2024 guidance by $500 million. General Electric Co. raised the full-year profit guidance for its aerospace business, driven by an increase in revenue from commercial aircraft engines and services. JetBlue Airways Corp. forecast worse-than-expected sales this quarter, blaming excess flying capacity in the critical Latin America market Philip Morris International Inc. raised its full-year outlook after strong sales of its heated tobacco and nicotine pouch products. Lockheed Martin Corp.’s first-quarter operating income beat expectations as it delivered more fighter jets and missile systems. Kering SA warned that profit will plunge in the first half of the year as the crisis at Gucci, its biggest brand, deepens.\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 rose 1.5% The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% The MSCI World index rose 1.2%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4% The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0702 The British pound rose 0.8% to $1.2449 The Japanese yen was little changed at 154.82 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin was little changed at $66,486.04 Ether rose 0.9% to $3,218.9\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.60% Germany’s 10-year yield advanced two basis points to 2.50% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 4.24%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.7% to $83.32 a barrel Spot gold fell 0.2% to $2,322.91 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani and Jessica Menton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire’s Cash Helped Fund a ‘Predatory’ Lender How a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets Big Junk Food’s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner China’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Skip the Robotaxi—Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple may strike a historic deal with FIFA—and give a major boost to its streaming service",
        "content": "Apple is reportedly doubling down on live sports through a first-of-its-kind agreement with global soccer governing body FIFA that would give it the worldwide television rights for a new tournament.\n\nThe TV deal could be announced as soon as this month, with the tournament set to be held in the U.S. next summer, reported the New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe agreement with Apple would be unique for FIFA, which usually strikes deals with several TV providers in different countries for global tournaments such as the World Cup.\n\nBy contrast, the Apple deal may reportedly omit free-to-air-rights, which could make the tournament available to Apple TV+ subscribers only—a point that has raised concern among some FIFA senior executives, according to the Times.\n\n\"As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,\" a FIFA spokesperson told Fortune.\n\nApple struck a similarly exclusive 10-year deal to secure the streaming rights for Major League Soccer at a $2.5 billion price tag last year. The agreement, which Apple dubbed MLS Season Pass, was prescient for the tech company. Subscriptions to Apple TV+ jumped by more than 100,000 in one day, compared to around 6,000 the day before, after World Cup winner Lionel Messi played his first game with MLS Club Inter Miami CF in June, the Wall Street Journalreported.\n\nAlthough Apple does not break out revenue for Apple TV+, the services business segment it belongs to netted the company $85.2 billion in net sales in 2023, up 9% from $78.1 billion the prior year, according to the company’s most recent 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe competition for live sports has heated up recently as streaming companies look to live sports to grow. Peacock streamed its third exclusive National Football League game in March and Amazon Prime just completed its second year of a $1 billion-per-season deal to stream the NFL’s Thursday Night Football programming. Apple has recently increased its interest in live sports deals as well.\n\nThe tech company is competing with other streamers such as Amazon Prime Video, Google’s YouTube, and Netflix to secure the rights to some NBA games, the Athleticreported Monday. Apple also struck a streaming rights deal with Major League baseball in 2022.\n\nThe new World Cup-style tournament, which FIFA previously said would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA (although that name is reportedly under review), will include 32 teams. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has long pushed for the competition that would pit some of the world’s best soccer clubs against each other every four years. Powerhouse clubs such as FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Serie A champions Inter Milan are already qualified to participate, according to FIFA.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Spotify's First Quarter Tells A Story Of Record Profit And An Epic Win\n\nAfter a year with of layoffs and activist attention that triggered many changes, Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) managed to surpass both top and bottom estimates. Moreover, the streaming giant reported record first quarter earnings as the result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives that also brought significant margin improvements.\n\nFirst Quarter Financials Shows That A Shift In Focus Paid Off\n\nFor the quarter ended in March, Spotify reported revenue rise 20% YoY to 3.64 billion euros, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of 3.61 billion.\n\nAs a result of cost-cutting efforts that included layoffs, Spotify reported earnings of 97 euro cents which equate to $1.04, leaving LSEG’s estimate of 65 euro cents far behind as gross margin reached 27.6%.\n\nSpotify ended its fiscal first quarter with 615 million monthly active users, which was 3 million short of StreetAccount’s estimate, but business grew as MAUs rose 19% YoY and 2% from the previous quarter. As part of cost-cutting measures, Spotify also lowered its marketing activity which also contributed to a more normalized growth. Spotify also grew its subscribers 14% YoY to 239 million.\n\nSecond Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, Spotify guided for net new MAUs of 16 million, which would bring the total of monthly active users to 631 million. With cost improvements across its business, the Swedish streaming company also forecasted its gross margin will improve to 28.1%.\n\nFirst Quarter Was A Victory For Spotify Across Many Fronts\n\nShifting its focus on strengthening revenue growth and expanding the margin paid off. In addition, the EU sided with Spotify in its epic battle with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the quarter. The EU punished Apple with a historic fine for distorting music streaming competition. Due to a complaint from Spotify, the EU already slapped Apple with an antitrust fine of $1.95 billion in March. This is a big victory for Spotify who started complaining back in 2019 about Apple preventing music streaming services from informing users of payment options outside its App Store. Despite the fact Apple is a tech titan, when it comes to music streaming, Spotify is the dominant one. Fortunately for Spotify, EU regulators are ignoring its dominance and going after Apple instead. Therefore, Spotify had a record profit as well as an epic win during the first quarter that will undoubtedly go down in its history.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Not all stocks have succeeded in the bull market that began about 18 months ago. In the current market, a rising tide has not lifted all boats. In fact, there are some very notable names that are currently on the decline. Who would have predicted a year ago that names such as electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would be down by double digits and badly lagging the benchmark S&P 500 index?\n\nYet this is the case as the competitive landscape and consumer trends have shifted. Once true blue stocks and reliable brands can no longer be trusted to deliver outsized gains to shareholders and surpass market returns. As such, investors are having to adjust their thinking and reevaluate their approach to stock picking. Here at InvestorPlace, we aim to help and offer the following warning. These three clue-chip stocks will have you seeing red. Avoid them at all costs.\n\nJohnson & Johnson jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nPharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ) stock has been a crushing disappointment for a long time. In the last 12 months, JNJ stock has declined nearly 10%, including a 6% drop this year. Through five years, the share price has gained a paltry 7%. Litigation related to its talc baby powder has weighed heavily on the stock. So too have middling financial results and a costly restructuring that hived off the company’s underperforming consumer healthcare products such as its shampoo.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson just reported its first quarter 2024 financial results, and they were once again mixed. Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.71 beat analyst expectations of $2.64. However, revenue in the quarter came in at $21.38 billion compared to $21.40 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Johnson & Johnson got a slight boost from its medical device business, where sales rose 4% from a year ago. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance, narrowing both its sales and profit outlooks. Wall Street was not impressed.\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of legacy telecommunications firm AT&T (NYSE:T) have been firmly in the red for years now. Over the past five years, T stock had decreased 30%. So far in 2024, the company’s share price has slid 6% lower. Even a rock bottom valuation of eight times future earnings estimates and a quarterly dividend that yields 6.81% isn’t enough to attract investors. The company, which remains the biggest wireless carrier in America, has careened from one disaster to another for the better part of a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest terrible news to drag T stock lower are reports that millions of its customers’ data was published on the infamous “dark web,” a corner of the Internet that can only be accessed using special software. AT&T said it is actively contacting more than 7.5 million impacted active customers, along with 65 million former account holders. The leak apparently involves data from 2019 and includes personal information such as names, home addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nDown nearly 30% on the year, shares of Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) are among the worst performing in the S&P 500 currently. In fact, as of this writing, LULU stock is the fifth worst performing stock listed on the benchmark index. The share price has been sliding lower ever since the athletic apparel company reported earnings in March that showed its North American sales slowing. The company reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 9% in North America compared to 29% growth a year earlier.\n\nLululemon also announced that, owing t0 declining sales, it is closing a distribution center in Washington state and eliminating 128 jobs. The company said it decided to close the distribution center as part of a re-evaluation of its network in the U.S. and Canada. The closure comes after Lululemon provided weak guidance, saying that for all of this year it expects sales of $10.70 billion to $10.80 billion compared with estimates of $10.90 billion. Profits are forecast at $14 to $14.20 a share compared to a $14.13 estimate on Wall Street.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Will Apple (AAPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "content": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Apple (AAPL), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry.\n\nThis maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4.67%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Apple came out with earnings of $2.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 4.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.\n\nFor Apple, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 2, 2024.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple ETFs in Tug-of-War Ahead of Q2 Earnings",
        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL has been an underperformer this year, with a year-to-date loss of 10.7%, underperforming other mega-cap technology companies. Its lesser exposure to AI within the “Magnificent Seven” group and concerns over the sales growth of iPhone in the key China market can be held responsible for this lackluster performance.\n\nPlus, rising rates have played a role in pushing the stock down in recent trading. Apple's stock recorded a 3.4% drop over the last five days. Apple is expected to come up with 2Q24 earnings results on May 2. Just prior to the earnings release, the stock is caught between bullish and bearish commentaries from Wall Street watchers.\n\nLet’s delve a little deeper:\n\nInside the Bullish Theory\n\nBank of America named Apple a top pick for 2024, citing optimism over upcoming results and longer-term prospects. Analyst Wamsi Mohan, with a buy rating and $225 price target, highlighted Apple's \"rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows.\"\n\nBofA has positive expectations about Apple's second-quarter results, with expectations of strong services revenue growth and margins. However, the bank warned about a potential pullback in shares due to a weak demand environment.\n\nInside the Bearish Theory\n\nMorgan Stanley lowered its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports. The firm suggests buying on post-earnings weakness, anticipating an upcoming Apple event focused on AI. Bloomberg Intelligence is still cautious, particularly regarding weaker iPhone demand in China.\n\nUBS Global Research also downgraded its rating on Apple with the other big five tech stocks. UBS downgraded because of tough comps and cyclical forces that hurt these stocks.\n\nTrend of Analysts' Earnings Estimate Revision\n\nThe company saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. The iPhone maker has a decent track of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average beat of 5.20% in the trailing four quarters.\n\nSkeptic Market Sentiment\n\nDespite Apple's prominence in benchmark equity indexes, Wall Street is fairly skeptical, with only 55% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommending the stock compared to higher percentages for other tech giants.\n\nHowever, some strategists find AAPL attractive given the stock's relatively cheaper valuation and potential benefits from a rotation to less rate-sensitive stocks amid high inflation and rising yields.\n\nBroker Rating\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\n\nPrice Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 28 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.24. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 24.39% from the last closing price of $165.00.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nInvestors intending to follow bullish comments from Wall Street analysts but still wary of slowing sales of Apple may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other big tech companies’ stellar presence.\n\nBelow, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.\n\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – AAPL occupies the second location with 16.39% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW – AAPL takes the second spot with 15.21% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Palantir Stock at a Crossroads: Analyzing the Risks and Rewards for Investors",
        "content": "I have been down on Palantir stock (NASDAQ:PLTR) for some time.\n\nIt is, at its heart, a government contractor. Calling it an AI stock doesn’t change that.\n\nMilitary contracting is a profitable but slow-growth business. Palantir brought almost 10% of last year’s $2.25 billion in revenue to the bottom line.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question is always whether it can do better, or grow faster, given the constraints of its business model. Like a political consulting firm, it can only play on one side of the street.\n\nI’m glad it’s our side.\n\nPalantir’s Commercial Arm\n\nThe bull case for Palantir stock has always been built on its commercial contracts.\n\nPalantir has been doing well in hospitals, planning and scheduling people and equipment.\n\nIt makes sense. Hospitals need data security. Palantir’s software can anticipate demand and plan accordingly, faster than people can. It’s not just replacing whiteboards and spreadsheets. It is very much a Machine Internet application.\n\nNow Palantir is exploring a new niche, ad agencies. The idea is that it can use inventory and demand data to optimize ad campaigns, buying ads and adjusting prices to maximize clients’ return. It’s bringing tools first written for logistics into sales and marketing. It’s getting a hearing.\n\nThis may be why the asset manager for Norway’s biggest bank recently cut his positions in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to buy more Palantir.  Bruce Kamich of TheStreet recently hiked his price target to $48 per share. This helped the stock stay hot during the first quarter, rising by over one-third.\n\nBut since April began, it’s down 19%.\n\nThe Bear Claw\n\nAI is one of those Internet buzzwords that make you swoon.\n\nBut isn’t Palantir getting a little ahead of itself, our Louis Navillier asks? Growth isn’t accelerating, nor is it expected to. It will certainly be profitable this year, and could be added to the S&P 500 at any time, forcing index funds to buy it.\n\nBut even if Palantir hits its top earnings estimate of 41 cents per share, you’re paying 49 times that to own it. That’s based on April 19’s closing price of $20.31.\n\nThe nosebleed valuation has some analysts downgrading the stock. Hype cycles, and AI is a hype cycle, are fragile things. Technologies always disappoint before they show their value.\n\nPalantir’s Key Ally\n\nWhile Palantir drew early interest by working with Cloud Czars like Microsoft, its alliance with Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) may be more important.\n\nThe two companies are sympatico on a deep level. Oracle was late to the cloud because it remains highly proprietary. Palantir is also highly proprietary.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut getting in late beats not getting in at all. Over the last 2 years Oracle stock is up 50% on the strength of its cloud. Its market cap is up to $315 billion. The deal also puts a floor under Palantir stock. If it falls, Oracle could buy it.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe wars in Ukraine and Gaza are very, very good news for Palantir. So is the rise of China. It’s prepared to exploit that through former Congressman Mike Gallagher, one of its new hires.\n\nWar is unhealthy for economies and other living things. It’s also very good for military contractors, especially those on the cutting edge like Palantir.\n\nBut getting Palantir stock to $48/share, or even $30, depends a lot more on its commercial arm than its military wing.\n\nI wouldn’t rush to buy Palantir here. The recent wobble in AI semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may spread. But keep it in mind the next time animal spirits are feeding your view of the market. The long-term view of the business is positive.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA.

        "title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimates",
        "content": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe company reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million) compared to a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven driven by share price appreciation during the quarter.\"\n\nThe audio giant also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also noted that Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 6% higher in pre-market trading following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion)— 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nStory continues\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at a 52-Week Low in April",
        "content": "A lot of well-known blue-chip stocks that previously dominated their respective industries are struggling this year. One need only look at the year-to-date performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index to see many notable names deep in the red so far in 2024. Companies such as Nike (NYSE:NKE), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), just to name a few, continue to slide lower. The situation has only gotten worse as the entire market declines to start the year’s second quarter.\n\nWhile concerning, and no doubt frustrating for existing shareholders, the continued drawdown presents an opportunity for investors to take new positions in some great stocks at or near their 52-week lows. Many of these top-shelf companies can be counted on to eventually rebound once their earnings strengthen, the operating environment improves, and market sentiment turns optimistic. In the meantime, investors have an opportunity to buy low in hopes of eventually selling high.\n\nHere are three blue-chip stocks to buy at a 52-week low in April.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems strange to say, but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now trading right around its 52-week low, having declined nearly 15% on the year. AAPL stock is also negative over the last 12 months (down 0.01%), meaning it has erased all of its gains from the 2023 bull market. In what might be a bad omen for the company’s upcoming earnings report on May 2, media reports tell us that CEO Tim Cook and other senior executives have sold more than $70 million of company stock in April as the share price has steadily fallen.\n\nCEO Cook has sold $33.3 million of Apple stock so far in April at an average price of $169.33 per share. Cook sold AAPL stock 12% below its peak of $192.53 reached in December 2023. At the same time, Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri, and Deirdre O’Brien, Senior Vice-President of Retail, also sold millions of dollars of Apple stock. This as International Data Corp. (IDC) reports that Apple’s iPhones shipments in the first quarter fell 9.6% from a year ago.\n\nAlso weighing on AAPL stock is the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against the technology giant, alleging that it violated federal law to preserve its position in the smartphone market. While there’s currently a buying opportunity with Apple’s stock, it might get even better after the company’s Q1 print in a few weeks.\n\nBoeing Co. (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nFor investors with a long time horizon, there is embattled airplane manufacturer Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). Having fallen 35% since January, BA stock is not only at a 52-week low, but is currently the third worst performing company in the S&P 500 index this year. Only Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Globe Life (NYSE:GL), which has been accused of fraud, have performed worse than Boeing. However, while down, Boeing is likely to be far from out-given that it is one of only two major commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world.\n\nStill, the pain for Boeing shareholders is likely to get worse before it gets better. The latest bad news is that airplane deliveries plunged in Q1 to their lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Boeing has faced increased safety reviews by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after a door plug blew off one of its 737 Max 9 airplanes in January. Consequently, Boeing delivered 83 new airplanes to customers in Q1, down 47% from 157 deliveries in the previous quarter.\n\nAs with Apple, Boeing’s stock could drop further after the company reports its Q1 financial results on April 24. But for long-term investors, the current share price decline could be a solid buying opportunity.\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) A yellow, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) branded airplane flying in the air\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother aviation stock that is right near its 52-week low and struggling right now is Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). Down 75% on the year, SAVE stock is now trading under $5 a share, putting it in penny stock territory. The steep selloff comes after JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) pulled out of a deal to purchase the discount carrier for $3.8 billion, and amid a Pratt & Whitney engine recall. Spirit Airlines announced that it is deferring new aircraft purchases and laying off 260 pilots as it struggles with a liquidity problem.\n\nWhile not without risk, SAVE stock could be worth a gamble now that its stock has fallen so much and is trading near rock bottom prices. The company appears to be doing all it can to conserve cash and improve its liquidity. Specifically, Spirit Airlines is deferring all aircraft orders, pushing them out as far as 2031. The budget airline is also furloughing the pilots. The combined moves will boost its liquidity by about $340 million over the next two years. And who knows, in that time another buyer may emerge for Spirit Airlines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Telegram founder says China downloads have not fallen since Apple move",
        "content": "By Josh Ye\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Pavel Durov, billionaire founder and CEO of Telegram, said Apple's move last week to remove the chat app from its China app store had not caused any decrease in downloads from China and criticised Apple instead for its \"walled garden\" app policies.\n\nDurov published a post in his public channel on Telegram on Monday in which he confirmed that Apple removed multiple apps including Telegram from its App Store in China last week. Apple said the Chinese government ordered the removal, citing \"national security\" concerns presented by these apps.\n\nBut Durov said Beijing's action was not a move against Telegram but a move against Apple itself. Rather than taking issues with the Chinese regulators, Durov focused much of his post on criticising the iPhone maker, taking aim at Apple's app policies.\n\n\"Once again, Apple shot itself in the foot with its centralized 'walled garden' app policies,\" he said.\n\n\"Unlike iPhones, most Android phones allow sideloading apps outside app stores — such as the direct version of Telegram — so more users from China will migrate to Android...As a result of this change, the iPhone market share in China will keep shrinking.\"\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast Friday, in addition to Telegram, Apple pulled WhatsApp, Meta's Threads and Signal from the App Store in China.\n\nApple's \"walled garden\" app policies, which reference Apple's long-time practice of not allowing iPhone users to install apps from any third-party app stores, have come under scrutiny in recent years.\n\nLast month, Apple was forced to start allowing alternative app stores on its devices in the European Union as the bloc's new Digital Markets Act bars the \"walled garden\" practice.\n\nUsers in China have to use proxy tools such as virtual private network (VPN) to bypass China's \"Great Firewall\" - the country's extensive cybersystem of censorship - to access Telegram. Durov said Telegram remained popular in China.\n\n\"Access to Telegram requires a VPN in China, but Chinese people are smart - they like Telegram and find a way to use it,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by David Evans)\n\nView comments",

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Evernote Alternatives in 2024.\n\nWhat's New With Evernote?\n\nEvernote is a leading note-taking application. The platform enables users to take notes, store files, and organize their to-do lists. These notes can then be shared, exported, and tagged. On April 5, Evernote announced 20 improvements to its application. Users can now benefit from slash commands, AI editing tools, collapsible sections, in-app notifications, and arrow ligatures, among other features. The application also integrates with the Outlook Calendar.\n\nOn March 23, Evernote announced the discontinuation of its legacy versions of the application. All users running the legacy version of the application on Windows, Android, and MacOS, will no longer be able to access Evernote. The legacy versions are being discontinued as they have not been maintained ever since Evernote v10 was introduced in 2020. Thus, the legacy version poses a security threat to the company. The discontinuation was enforced on March 26, 2024.\n\nNote Taking Solutions by Tech Giants\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also offer note-taking solutions. Let's take a look at their offerings.\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Keep is a free note taking solution. Users can create notes, edit existing notes, develop lists, and draw. Google Keep has a range of themes and colors available for use. Users can also pin important notes and set reminders. Google Keep users may also share editable versions of their notes with others. The application can be integrated with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Assistant. Google Assistant can create notes for a user when ordered by voice. Users with an Android tablet can use Google Keep in dual pane view.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneNote is a digital note taking solution. The solution can be used for free as a mobile and web application. It is a part of the Microsoft 365 Suite. The application allows users to store, organize, and print information. Users can also collaborate with fellow users to create notes. OneNote is synced across all the devices of a user. A single page on Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneNote is an infinite canvas, allowing users to write anywhere on the page and play around.\n\nLike Google Keep, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Notes application allows users to make notes, create lists, insert stickers and emojis, and add screenshots and recordings. Apple Notes also allows users to draw in documents, fill out forms, and sign documents. Users can also use the Notes app to scan documents, save them in the app, and add signatures if needed. Apple Notes can be accessed on the web by signing into Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iCloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nCan Note Taking Startups like Wudpecker AI compete with Tech Giants?\n\nWudpecker AI is a stand-alone note-taking software backed by artificial intelligence. The AI assistant follows instructions and automatically takes human-like notes for meetings. It creates tables, collects discussion insights, and highlights any important decisions taken during the meeting. More than 10,000 teams are using the platform. The platform can also be integrated with other applications including Notion, Slack, and Hubspot. Users can create notes in more than 100 languages. The AI backed platform stores instructions on special words and their spellings. It then stores the information and follows suit for all notes taken in the future.\n\nOn April 11, Wudpecker AI announced the launch of its MacOS native application for bot-less recording. This means that no AI bots will be joining meetings. However, this also means that hosts will have to start recording themselves, and they must also inform participants about the recording. The Windows version will be launched soon. On March 25, Wudpecker AI launched a solution enabling users to personalize their notes. Users can train Wudpecker AI on how they want their notes to be taken. For instance, if a user wants the notes in a table format, the AI will take the instructions into account for all future notes. The Evaluator tool also provides feedback on the given instructions helping users improve their future notes.\n\nNow that we have discussed prominent note-taking apps and platforms, let's discuss the 20 best Evernote alternatives in 2024.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in April",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the tech world over the last year, skyrocketing countless stocks. However, AI is by no means a new concept. So you might be asking yourself, why has it suddenly blown up?\n\nWhile computers are excellent at numerical tasks and data processing, they haven't always been capable of natural human capabilities like language, visual processing, and various generative tasks. However, AI bridges that gap, using machine learning to complete tasks that typically require a human.\n\nAs a result, advances in AI can potentially benefit a wide range of markets, including consumer tech, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, education, and more. And with the market and technology still in their infancy, it seems the sky's the limit for AI.\n\nIn fact, the AI sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion. The market's significant potential suggests it's not too late to invest in and profit from the tailwinds of AI long into the future.\n\nSo here are three AI stocks that are screaming buys this April.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIt hasn't been easy to be an Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) investor in recent years, with its stock down 27% since 2022. However, the company has made significant changes to its business model over the last year that could make it an attractive long-term option for investing in AI.\n\nIntel is expanding in the market by launching its new line of Gaudi 3 AI graphics processing units (GPUs). The chips were released earlier this month, and claim to have 50% better inference and 40% better power efficiency than similar offerings from Nvidia.\n\nAdditionally, Intel is using its years of dominance and expertise in central processing units (CPUs) to secure a top spot in AI by expanding the AI capabilities of its processors. AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIt'll take time for Intel to develop its AI business and catch up to rivals like Nvidia and AMD. However, the chart above indicates that Intel is potentially the best-valued AI chip stock. Intel has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) among these companies, making it a relative bargain.\n\nThe company is on an exciting growth path, and too good to pass up right now.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been quieter on the AI front than many of its peers. However, the company is known for taking its time with new technology. Apple isn't necessarily known for pioneering innovations, but for perfecting established technology with its own design language and then rising to dominance in the industry by attracting billions of users.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarkets such as Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, and tablets were each led by different companies before Apple appeared on the scene. However, the launch of products like AirPods, the Apple Watch, and the iPad have made its competitors almost a distant memory. As a result, it's not too concerning that Apple isn't currently one of the top dogs in AI.\n\nThe tech giant appears to be quietly honing its AI technology. Meanwhile, its leading market shares in multiple areas of consumer tech could see it steer the industry and become a major growth driver in getting AI into the hands of the average shopper.\n\nApple shares saw a slight surge on April 11 when Bloomberg reported that the company was overhauling its entire Mac lineup to expand its AI capabilities and meet soaring demand for such hardware. Meanwhile, the tech company has been gradually adding new AI features across its product lineup, including improvements to the iPhone's Siri and new gestures for the Apple Watch. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nLast year Apple generated nearly $107 billion in free cash flow, considerably more than some of AI's most prominent players, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon. This figure suggests that Apple is well-equipped to expand in the budding AI market and keep up with its rivals over the long term.\n\nApple's stock is trading at 25 times forward earnings, making it a reasonable buy and an exciting way to invest in AI.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been slightly overshadowed in AI over the last year by cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon. However, the company is easily one of the most exciting AI stocks for long-term gains.\n\nThe company is home to a long list of potent brands, including Google, Chrome, Android, and YouTube. These services regularly attract billions of users, giving Alphabet ample opportunity to tout its AI offerings.\n\nAs a result, the company's recent pivot to the lucrative market is promising. Earlier this year, Alphabet launched Gemini, its most advanced AI model to date. Its debut wasn't perfect, with the model making some mistakes at its launch presentation, which forced the company to temporarily pause its image generation services.\n\nHowever, Alphabet is moving forward in its AI development. The company recently announced plans to consolidate its Deep Mind and Research teams to promote efficiency in its AI division. Alphabet will move its AI-focused Responsible AI teams to Deep Mind, where its models are built.\n\nLike Intel and Apple, Alphabet's shares are a bargain compared to other AI stocks. Its forward P/E currently sits at an attractive 23, significantly lower than Microsoft's 34 and Amazon's 43.\n\nAlphabet's stock is a screaming buy this month, and one you won't want to miss out on.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Increases Yet Falls Behind Market: What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Apple (AAPL) standing at $165.67, reflecting a +0.41% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.87%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.67%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.11%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 4.23% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.98% and falling behind the S&P 500's loss of 3.97%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on May 2, 2024. In that report, analysts expect Apple to post earnings of $1.50 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 1.32%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $89.79 billion, down 5.32% from the year-ago period.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.54 per share and revenue of $383.47 billion. These totals would mark changes of +6.69% and +0.05%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.07% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Apple is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 25.22. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 8.72.\n\nInvestors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 1.99 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Mini computers industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.99.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 243, positioning it in the bottom 4% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move means that third-party firms will now be able to use Meta Horizon as the software backbone for their own headsets.\n\nZuckerberg announced the move via Instagram, saying that the next age of computing should be powered by an open software model.\n\n“Our goal is to make it so that the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets,” said Zuckerberg. “So that’s why we're releasing our operating system so that more companies can build different things on it.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck)\n\nGoogle’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android operating system is considered an open software model because it allows users to install third-party apps, albeit through a convoluted and annoying process. Windows PCs and Apple’s (AAPL) Macs also offer open software models, letting you download and install any apps you’d like.\n\nApple’s iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Vision Pro, however, are closed, meaning you can only install software from Apple’s App Store. It’s worth noting that Zuckerberg has a long-running distaste for Apple and its closed software model. The CEO has repeatedly criticized the company for not allowing certain app features on the iPhone and introducing privacy options that cut off Meta’s ability to capture user data.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nZuckerberg said Meta is already working with ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft (MSFT) on plans for future headsets, with more companies to follow. Though, he also pointed out that it will likely take a few years for the headsets to hit the market.\n\nThe plan, so far, seems to be for Meta’s partners to develop headsets for specific use cases. Meta currently offers its Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nIn his Instagram post, Zuckerberg pointed to an example of a lightweight headset that pairs to a computer on your desk dedicated to productivity work, while another could focus on watching movies and videos and be outfitted with high-resolution OLED displays.\n\nHe also touched on ideas for fitness-focused headsets built with lightweight, sweat-wicking materials, as well as an Xbox-style headset that connects to Microsoft’s Game Pass service and a controller to let gamers play anywhere they want.

Microsoft also attempted to get its now-defunct Windows Mixed Reality platform off the ground with manufacturing partners like ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung building headsets powered by the software.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe headsets never caught on, though, and Microsoft is now set to remove the platform entirely from the next big Windows 11 update.\n\nThe AR/VR headset market is still a relatively niche technology segment, even among teens. According to Piper Sandler’s most recent Taking Stock with Teens survey, 33% of teens surveyed own a VR device, but only 4% use it on a daily basis. Another 13% said they use their headsets weekly, while a whopping 56% said they seldom use them. What’s more, 32% of teens said they aren’t interested in and have no plans to buy headsets.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. was named a top pick for 2024 at Bank of America on optimism over the iPhone maker’s upcoming results, as well as its longer-term prospects.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway Ray Dalio’s Famous Trade Is Sputtering and Investors Are Bailing TikTok to Remove Executive Tasked With Fending Off US Claims Stocks Climb as US Earnings Kick Into High Gear: Markets Wrap Russians Transform Dubai as They Flee Putin’s War: Photo Essay\n\nThe company has a “rich catalyst path with defensive cash flows,” wrote analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has a buy rating and $225 price target on the stock.\n\nApple’s second-quarter results are scheduled for release next week, and BofA is largely positive on the prospects, with “services revenue growth and margins to remain strong.” However, it cautioned that “the demand environment is weak and a lower guide for F2Q could influence a pullback in shares.”\n\nApple’s shares rose 0.5% on Monday. The stock is coming off its lowest close in about a year, as well as a five-day drop of 6.5% that erased nearly $180 billion from its market capitalization. The stock is down 14% this year, making it one of the weakest performers among megacap technology companies.\n\nThe stock has been pressured by concerns over growth, especially for the iPhone in the key China market, as well as regulatory pressure and the lack of a strategy surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nSeparately, Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target on the stock to $210 from $220 on Monday, expecting Apple to give a disappointing forecast when it reports.\n\n“This appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup,” wrote analyst Erik Woodring. The firm recommends buying on post-earnings weakness, given an upcoming Apple event focused on AI.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence is also cautious, writing that Apple, given weaker iPhone demand in China, “will likely give fiscal 3Q sales guidance for the device below consensus’ 2% drop.” Analyst Anurag Rana adds that “this could prolong the company’s slow growth and negative sentiment.”\n\nWhile Apple remains a dominant stock in benchmark equity indexes, accounting for 5.7% of the S&P 500, Wall Street is fairly skeptical. Just 55% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while for Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. the percentage of bulls is near or above 85%.\n\nSome strategists view it as attractive following the year-to-date drop, however. Cantor Fitzgerald recently wrote that the valuation “has now contracted to a much more reasonable level.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald’s head of cross asset and equity derivatives, added that “with inflation running hot and yields pushing higher, we believe this environment will attract capital to less rate-sensitive stocks and given AAPL’s underperformance, we believe it will be a major beneficiary from this rotation.”\n\n(Updates to market close.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation’s Secrets China’s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "TSMC Topped Estimates On The Back Of Insatiable AI Demand",
        "content": "TSMC Topped Estimates On The Back Of Insatiable AI Demand\n\nLast Thursday, the world’s largest producer of advanced processors issued its first quarter results and they were even better than expected as AI demand continues to go strong. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM), whose customers include the AI chip leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) as well as the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), expects 2024 to be another year of healthy growth on the back of its technology leadership and broad customer base that also includes Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nFirst Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 31st, TSMC reported net revenue grew 16.5% YoY to NT$592.64 billion. Net income rose 8.9% YoY to NT$225.49 billion.\n\nThe net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, while an industry average is about 14%, reflecting TSMC’s competitiveness.\n\nNvidia Set To Become The TSMC Of AI\n\nEarlier in March, Nvidia clearly stated its aim to become the TSMC for AI as it continues its expansion beyond hardware, entering into software services. During its annual conference, GTC 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangunveiled new tools. In terms of AI development, Nvidia aims to do for the world exactly that what TSMC does for the AI chip leader by turning its design and concept into physical chips. Therefore, TSMC builds the chips Nvidia, Apple and others need and Nvidia wants to become the AI maker, turning concepts of its clients into a model they get to bring with them.\n\nSecond Quarter Guidance\n\nFor the current quarter, TSMC is supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, but this strength is partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality. TSMC guided for second-quarter revenue in the range between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion. Due to the recent earthquake in Taiwan along with higher electricity costs, TSMC expects the second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint. Fortunately, the earthquake that occurred on April 3rd did not cause any power shortages, nor structural damage to the company’s facilities and critical tools such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system. One of its closest competitors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), lost the lead because TSMC was the first to adopt EUV lithography systems that are essential for its leadership. Although some wafers were affected and had to be scrapped, most of the lost production should be recovered in current quarter, with minimal impact to revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutlook\n\nWith AI demand going strong, TSMC managed to weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand, fueling its stock to new heights. In 2025, TSMC is planning to begin mass-producing its 2-nanometer chips, which come with more power and efficiency compared to its current 3-nanometer ones. As for the full year, TSMC estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than double. For the full year, TSMC guided for low to mid-20% revenue growth under the assumption that the AI market continues to expand while the PC market stabilizes, and the smartphone market returns to growth amid an improved macroeconomic backdrop. Although TMSC might not keep the pace with Nvidia in terms of near-term gains due to the fact its business goes beyond chips, it certainly won’t be in a recovery mode like its client, Qualcomm, after the 2023 lulled the smartphone market to sleep. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fiscal second quarter results on May 1st. Best known for making smartphone chips, Qualcomm did surpass estimates with its fiscal first quarter financials and its upcoming report should reflect the business picking up as smartphone sales continue to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Amid the delayed prospect of rate cuts and an increase in geopolitical tension, the technology sector has been seeing brutal trading in recent weeks after a strong first quarter. Notably, the Magnificent Seven stocks suffered the worst-ever weekly loss in terms of market capitalization, erasing $950 billion last week.\r\n\r\nNvidia NVDA, which has been leading the artificial intelligence boom, shed almost $300 billion and became the biggest market-cap loser. Shares of Nvidia fell 13.6% last week and are down sharply, about 22% from its March high, indicating that it is in bear market territory. Meanwhile, Tesla TSLA witnessed the biggest decline percentage among the Magnificent Seven as its market cap fell by $76 billion. The electric car maker posted the worst quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued its slump in the second quarter as well.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT lost $178 billion and $169 billion, respectively, in market cap. Amazon AMZN shed $118 billion in market value while Meta Platforms META and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) erased a respective $68 billion and $41 billion from their valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, first-quarter earnings are expected to drive the whole group higher. Overall, first-quarter earnings for \"Magnificent Seven\" are expected to grow 33% from the same period last year on 12.7% higher revenues.

        "title": "Spotify earnings preview: Investors eye potential price hikes with profits in focus",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) is set to report its fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Wall Street expects the music streamer to swing to a profit on an adjusted basis as the company continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company also said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\n\"The hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been,\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call in February.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the costs of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\"\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects from the upcoming report, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.61 billion euros versus 3.04 billion euros in Q1 2023 Adjusted earnings per share: 0.65 euros versus adjusted loss of 1.16 euros in Q1 2023 Total monthly active users (MAUs): 618 million versus 515 million in Q1 2023 Premium subscribers: 239 million versus 210 million in Q1 2023\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\n\"Podcast margins were near breakeven in 4Q23, and management commentary signaled that margins are likely to positively inflect and drive profitability through 2024,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note on Friday ahead of the results.\n\nNollen maintained his Outperform rating on shares but raised his price target to $330 from $300 \"given the continued focus on profitability.\"\n\nSpotify guided to gross margins of 26.4% in Q1 after the metric came in at 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Over the long term, Spotify expects gross margins between 30% and 35% amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. Wall Street analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\n\"We think the change is welcome given Spotify's renewed focus on profitability,\" Nollen said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in newdeals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This marked the first year-over-year drop in quarterly deliveries since 2020.\r\n\r\nThe decline was due to “the early phase of the production ramp-up” of its updated Model 3 at its Fremont factory and plant shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin, which led to a weeklong production halt in its Germany factory.

        "title": "Why the Magnificent 7's 'momentum is collapsing'",
        "content": "The run may be over for the seven stocks that drove the lion's share of the stock market rally over the past year.\n\nUBS Investment Bank Chief US equity strategist Jonathan Golub downgraded six of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) — from Overweight to Neutral in a new research note on Monday.\n\nHis call comes as the Magnificent 7, whichalso includes Tesla (TSLA), just had its largest weekly market cap loss in history. All seven of the big tech leaders are off their recent highs, as highlighted by a 10% single day-drawdown for Nvidia, its worst one day price performance since March 2020.\n\nGolub, who rates sectors within the S&P 500 (^GSPC) not individual stocks, remains Overweight on technology outside of the six stocks he names in his note. But for the large companies who have grown earnings significantly over the past year, Golub believes the tide may be shifting, and other areas are set to outperform the largest stocks in the S&P 500.\n\n\"Investors attribute the run in mega cap stocks to animal spirits and the impact of AI,\" Golub wrote. \"However, our work indicates that surging earnings momentum (change in forward growth projections) fueled this upside. Unfortunately, this momentum is collapsing.\"\n\nTesla, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet are expected to report quarterly results later this week.\n\nEarnings for the S&P 500 have largely been driven by earnings growth in the large tech stocks. That's expected to play out again during first quarter reports, with FactSet projecting Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia to combine for earnings growth of roughly 64%. Meanwhile the other 495 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report an earnings decline of 6%.\n\nBut over the course of the year, this is expected to shift. Consensus estimates from FactSet show earnings for those five companies are set to end the year with just shy of 20% year-over-year earnings growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting significantly slower growth than their prior pace. By that point, consensus expects the other 495 companies to be growing earnings by about 17% compared to the year prior, a significant uptick from their current growth rate.\n\n\"Our downgrade of the Big 6—from Overweight to Neutral—is not predicated on extended valuations, or doubts about AI,\" Golub wrote. \"Rather, it is an acknowledgement of the difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks. These forces do not apply to other TECH+ companies or the rest of the market in the same way.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift in where earnings are growing the most could be \"disruptive in the near term,\" Golub said. But given increasing signs that the US economy is growing faster-than-expected this year, Golub thinks a broadening out in earnings performance over the next year keeps his 5,400 call on the S&P 500 to end the 2024 in play.\n\n\"This target remains supported by broadly positive fundamentals and a robust economy,\" Golub wrote.

        "content": "The FTSE 100 has risen faster than its European peers to start the week - Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe FTSE 100 has closed at a record high as investors were reassured by easing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe UK’s index of the largest 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange closed at 8,023.87 on Monday, after jumping by 128 points or 1.6pc.\n\nThe performance means the FTSE 100 beat its previous closing record of 8,014 set in February 2023.\n\nThe blue-chip index climbed as high as 8,042.81 during Monday’s session, although fell short of its all-time high of 8,047.06.\n\nThe rally was triggered by an easing of heightened tensions in the Middle East, after Iran’s recent attack on Israel fuelled fears of wider conflict in the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOil prices retreated after Iran on Friday downplayed Israel’s retaliatory drone drake and said it did not plan to retaliate.\n\nA barrel of Brent crude oil dropped 0.3pc to $87.09 on Monday as markets were closing in London.\n\nKazuo Kamitani, a strategist at Nomura Securities, said: “It seems neither Israel nor Iran want an escalation in the crisis in the Middle East ... and with a subsequent strike from either side not looking like it’s coming, investor concerns have eased somewhat.”\n\nMohit Kumar, chief economist Europe at Jefferies, added: “Overnight, risk sentiment is better on a relief rally that no adverse geopolitical headlines were reported on the weekend.”\n\nThe FTSE 100 has also been boosted by a weaker pound, which has made UK stocks cheaper for international investors to buy.\n\nThe pound sunk to $1.23 for the first time since November amid signs that US interest rates will stay higher for longer than previously expected.\n\nIt marked a fresh 2024 low for sterling and follows comments from deputy Bank of England governor Sir Dave Ramsden last Friday that UK inflation could be lower than expected over the next three years.\n\nThe FTSE 100 rally was also driven by a surge in retailer stocks. Marks & Spencer rose by 4.4pc, Sainsbury jumped 3.9pc, Tesco climbed 3.5pc and Ocado moved up 3.2pc.\n\nLondon led the way among major European markets on Monday, with Frankfurt’s Dax up 0.7pc and the Cac 40 in Paris rising by 0.2pc as oil and gold prices dipped.\n\nStory continues\n\n06:19 PM BST\n\nSigning off\n\nThat’s all from us! We’ll be back first thing tomorrow with the latest.\n\n05:07 PM BST\n\nAsda apologises for payroll chaos that left thousands of workers out of pocket\n\nAsda’s finance chief has apologised for a botched IT upgrade that saw thousands of workers paid the wrong amount, as he said the supermarket has not yet found a new chief executive.\n\nMichael Gleeson said the company was sorry for the “anxiety” caused by payroll issues, which is understood to have impacted 30,000 employees. Some were underpaid and others were overpaid because of problems with the changeover.\n\nPayroll issues have been ongoing for two months and were caused by Asda switching away from IT systems used by its previous owner, Walmart.\n\nBusiness reporter Daniel Woolfson has the full story...\n\n04:35 PM BST\n\nFTSE 100 closes on record high\n\nThe FTSE 100 has closed at a record high, kicking off the week as the best performing European market amid an easing of tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe UK’s flagship stock market climbed 1.62pc today to close at 8,023.87, beating its previous record closing high of 8,014 set in February 2023.\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nUBS downgrades Big Tech stocks amid sector-wide slowdown\n\nProfit growth momentum of the so-called “Big Six” technology stocks could collapse amid a sector-wide slowdown, according to UBS.\n\nUBS Global Research downgraded Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia stocks from ‘Overweight’ to ‘Neutral’.\n\nGrowth in earnings per share for the six tech stocks is expected to slow 42pc in the first quarter of 2024, from 68pc growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to UBS.\n\nThe stocks downgrade recognises the “difficult comps and cyclical forces weighing on these stocks,” said Jonathan Golub at UBS.\n\nIt is not predicated on extended valuations or doubts about artificial intelligence, he added.\n\nIt comes after last week’s tech sector sell-off as investors flocked towards safe investments, such as gold and government bonds.\n\nNvidia shares dropped 10pc on Friday, wiping out $212bn in market value from the AI chipmaker.\n\n03:58 PM BST\n\nChill Brands says inside information allegations are ‘without merit’\n\nCallum Sommerton, the chief executive of vape and CBD product manufacturer Chill Brands, said he is “surprised and disappointed” by the inside information allegations made against him.\n\nHe was suspended by Chill Brands after allegations were raised about “the use of inside information”.\n\nThe UK-listed company has hired law firm Fieldfisher to carry out an investigation following the claims and it has begun the process of appointing an interim boss.\n\nThe London-based company produces and distributes nicotine-free vapes under the Chill Zero brand, and has announced plans to launch its own online marketplace for third-party products.\n\nMr Sommerton’s suspension does not constitute disciplinary action or a disciplinary penalty and does not imply any assumption that he is guilty of any misconduct or that any decision has been made.\n\nHis full response is below:\n\nSTATEMENT\r\n\r\nI am surprised and disappointed by the allegations made against me, which I believe are without merit. I am confident that I will be vindicated. I will avoid further comment at this time to allow the process to progress.\n\n— Callum Sommerton (@callumsomm) April 22, 2024\n\n03:32 PM BST\n\nHanding over\n\nI’ll duck out at this point and, in a blast from the past, hand over the reins to Adam Mawardi, who will provide the latest updates from here.\n\nI will leave you with these images of a driver carrying paddy straw in Bangladesh.\n\nThe straw is used by farmers as food and bedding for their livestock. A driver carries paddy straw in a small truck in Kazipur Upazila, Sirajganj District, Bangladesh - Syed Mahabubul Kader/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock Paddy straw is a by-product for the farmers so they usually sell it for $7 per 100kg to wholesalers. The straw is then sold by the wholesalers for between $8 to $10 - Syed Mahabubul Kader/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\n03:21 PM BST\n\nFTSE rises as ‘interest rate cuts spied on the horizon’\n\nAs the FTSE 100 remained on track for a new record high, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\n\nLondon’s blue-chip index has had a surge of power as heightened geopolitical tensions have eased, and investors assessed the brighter prospects for the UK economy, with interest rate cuts spied on the horizon.\n\nIt’s tantalisingly close to breaching the all-time intraday high of 8,047 and it’s been trading above its record closing value of 8,014.\n\nGold, a safe haven asset, has slipped back slightly in the absence of fresh attacks by Iran or Israel. However, the precious metal is still hovering close to record highs.\n\nBrent crude has also fallen back slightly as the focus turns to the prospects of weakening demand in the US if high interest rates linger for longer.\n\nHowever, it’s not had much effect on the share prices of the big energy giants. Tensions are still simmering in the Middle East and there are ongoing concerns about the potential that they could flare up again, causing fresh disruption to supplies.\n\n03:11 PM BST\n\nUS shares rise after Netflix fuelled sell-off\n\nWall Street stocks bounced as markets attempt to rebound from last week’s losses amid worries about earnings and geopolitical troubles.\n\nThe Nasdaq on Friday sank more than 2pc as traders feared a rout in Netflix shares after earnings would be repeated this week when Amazon, Microsoft and other tech giants report results.\n\nInvestors are also edgy about the brittle situation in the Middle East and they are facing fewer potential interest rate cuts this year than previously thought.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3pc, the broad-based S&P gained 0.5pc, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.8pc.\n\nAmong individual companies, Tesla fell as much as 3.2pc following another round of price cuts in the latest sign of intensifying competition among electric vehicles. The company will report results this week.\n\nNike slid 0.4pc after disclosing to state officials in Oregon that it plans to cut 740 jobs from its headquarters. It quickly recovered to be flat on the day.\n\nJay Hatfield, chief executive at InfraCap said:\n\nThe market got over-sold on Friday because of Netflix earnings, it was primarily a tech-driven decline.\n\nWe’re headed into megacap earnings and so people are starting to realize that Netflix is not very indicative of what’s going to happen with other megacap stocks.\n\n02:52 PM BST\n\nOcado jumps amid pressure to switch to New York listing\n\nOcado shares climbed as the retail technology comes under pressure from shareholders to consider abandoning London for New York, threatening another severe blow to the beleaguered UK stock market.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph revealed that it is understood face-to-face conversations have been held with investors in recent weeks in which the idea of shifting its listing to America was discussed in detail.\n\nAt a private dinner around the time that its annual results were published last month, at least one leading fund manager told management that it would like to see the prospect of a trans-Atlantic shift explored properly.\n\nShares in Ocado moved 4.4pc higher to 362.4p as investors welcomed the prospect.\n\nOcado Group declined to comment. Ocado shares have climbed on the FTSE 100\n\n02:38 PM BST\n\nWall Street bounces back from steep losses\n\nThe main US stock markets have opened higher amid easing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.5 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 38,116.89 as investors also look ahead to an action-packed week with major tech earnings and key inflation data.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 20.1 points, or 0.4pc, at the open to 4,987.33&ZeroWidthSpace;, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 114.1 points, or 0.8pc, to 15,396.13 at the opening bell.\n\n02:29 PM BST\n\nHornby hit by Red Sea shipping delays\n\nModel trains maker Hornby has said some deliveries have been delayed as a result of shipping attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nMargate-based Hornby, a more than 100-year-old business which specialises in toys and collectibles, said its sales have fallen in recent months.\n\nShares fell nearly 12pc after it said group sales over the first three months of the year were 8pc less than the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThis decline was partly driven by delays to deliveries via the Red Sea, with the movement of some container ships being pushed back from March to April.\n\nOngoing attacks along key trade routes in the Suez Canal have had a knock-on effect to international shipping, forcing some container ships to re-route and driving up freight costs.\n\nIran-backed Houthi rebels are behind the attacks in what they say is a campaign of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nOther retailers like Pepco Group, which owns Poundland, and fashion chain Next have flagged heightened freight charges and delays due to disruption in the Middle East. Hornby said it has been hit by shipping delays caused by the attacks in the Red Sea - Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\n02:13 PM BST\n\nPound falls close to £1.23\n\nThe pound has fallen to its lowest level since November amid growing speculation that the Bank of England could cut interest rates before the US Federal Reserve.\n\nSterling was last down 0.5pc to just over $1.23, its lowest level since November 14 last year.\n\nDavid Morrison, senior market analyst at FCA, said:\n\nSterling is under pressure once again. Comments last week from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, have encouraged some selling as he kept alive the prospect of an earlier-than-expected rate cut, thanks to the prospect of a sharp fall in inflation.\n\nDespite this, there’s still speculation that the Bank won’t move until November.\n\n02:02 PM BST\n\nHeathrow refuelling staff to go on strike\n\nWorkers who refuel aircraft at Heathrow Airport are to strike in a dispute over terms and conditions during the May bank holiday weekend.\n\nMembers of Unite employed by AFS will walk out for 72 hours from Saturday, May 4.\n\nThe union said AFS, a joint venture between oil and gas companies, was planning to cut pension and sickness benefits.\n\nHeathrow Airport is working on contingencies with AFS to manage any potential disruption, saying it has “robust” measures planned, adding that passengers can book flights from Heathrow with confidence.

And you guys decided to go and become a lot more like continental Europe.\n\n“Take a look at the share of government spending to GDP.

which would put bills up by more than £50 a month - would be met if it is allowed by Ofwat to invest an extra £1.9bn in fixing storm overflows and pollution.\n\nUnder its initial plan published in October, it would now only raise bills to £608 a year by 2030, compared to £611 originally forecast, after removing some operational expenditure.\n\nThis would still be a £175 a year increase compared to the £433 paid on average 2023 to 2024.\n\nThe company admitted these are “some small changes to parts of our plan”.\n\n09:51 AM BST\n\nPound falls as US rates expected to stay high\n\nThe pound dipped to its lowest level against the dollar in five months amid expectations that US Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nSterling was down 0.1pc at $1.236 having dropped below $1.24 for the first time since November last week.\n\nSterling has lost around 3pc in value against the dollar in 2024, mostly due to traders drastically reassessing how much US interest rates might fall by this year.\n\nInvestors are pricing in roughly two quarter-point cuts from the Bank of England this year, compared with fewer than two from the Federal Reserve and with nearly three from the European Central Bank.\n\nAgainst the euro, the pound is still up 0.4pc, but its advantage over the single European currency has eroded sharply in the last week or so.\n\nThe euro was up 0.1pc against the pound at 86p.\n\n09:30 AM BST\n\nGas prices slip as cold snap barely dents supplies\n\nGas prices have dropped to their lowest level in more than a week after stock were barely touched during a cold snap across Europe.\n\nEurope’s benchmark contract was down as much as 4.4pc as the easing tensions in the Middle East also boosted confidence that the continent can cope with shocks to its energy supplies.\n\nThe UK’s equivalent contract fell as much as 4.9pc.\n\nSupplies across Europe remain abundant despite cold temperatures over the last week, sitting above the usual levels for the time of year and with milder temperatures forecast.\n\n09:10 AM BST\n\nAsda profits boosted by loyalty scheme\n\nAsda has revealed its underlying earnings swelled by a quarter last year with growth in food and clothing sales boosted by its rewards scheme for shoppers.\n\nThe UK’s third-biggest supermarket chain said its underlying earnings, before additional costs like tax and interest, rose by 24pc to £1.1bn over 2023, compared with 2022.\n\nIt came as supermarket sales, excluding fuel, grew 5.4pc on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the impact of new stores opening during the year.\n\nTotal sales, excluding fuel, hit nearly £22bn during the year, as the chain said it had benefited from about six million customers now using its loyalty app to shop with the retailer.\n\nAround half of all sales are linked to its reward programme, Asda Rewards, which it described as a “key revenue driver” for the business.\n\nThe group, which runs fashion retailer George, said clothing sales edged up by 3.4pc to total £1.5bn.\n\nMohsin Issa, Asda’s co-owner, said: “We continue to strengthen the business by expanding in the growing convenience and food-to-go sectors, leveraging our loyalty app and driving innovation in online grocery where we are the UK’s second-largest supermarket.”\n\nThe publication of its annual results comes amid reports that Mr Issa’s brother, Zuber Issa, is getting ready to sell his stake in the group to private equity group TDR Capital.\n\nThe Issa brothers joined forces with TDR to buy Asda three years ago for £6.8bn.

That would have seen the amount paid per household rise from an average of £436 per year to £609.\n\nWhen Thames revealed last month that its shareholders had refused to inject another £500m into the business, Ofwat said the utility company “must now pursue all options to seek further equity for the business to turn around”.\n\nA spokesman said at the time that customer and the environment must be “at the heart” of the sector’s priorities, adding:\n\nIn order to drive this change, we need to ensure that the sector attracts investment and is fair to bill payers.\n\nSince 2020 nearly £4.6bn new equity has been injected into the sector.

It will issue its draft decision in June.\n\nThames Water aims to increase typical bills from £433 a year in 2023 to 2024 to £627 by 2029 to 2030, an increase of 45pc to an average of £52.25 a month.\n\nIt comes after shareholders last month said they would not give the company a promised £500m lifeline which had been part of a planned £3.75bn funding package designed to see the company through to 2030.\n\nChief executive Chris Weston said: “Our business plan focuses on our customers’ priorities.\n\n“As part of the usual ongoing discussions relating to PR24, we’ve now updated it to deliver more projects that will benefit the environment.

        "content": "Chinese e-commerce giant JD stock (NASDAQ:JD) reported strong fourth-quarter results, indicating that its new initiatives are meaningfully boosting its business. Meanwhile, the valuation of JD stock is extremely low, while I believe that investors are significantly underestimating the strength of the Chinese economy. Finally, the firm’s huge share buyback initiative suggests that JD.com is confident in its own outlook and should lift the shares over the longer term.\n\nGiven these points, I’m bullish on the company’s long-term outlook. Value investors looking for exposure to developing countries and/or e-commerce plays should consider buying JD stock.\n\nStrong Fourth-Quarter Results and a Very Attractive Valuation\n\nJD’s Q4 earnings per share came in at 2.13 Chinese yuan, up from 1.91 Chinese yuan in Q4 of 2022 and its Q4 EBITDA climbed an impressive 8.6% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Moreover, its revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year to 306.1 billion Chinese yuan.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn JD’s Q4 earnings call, CEO Rax Xu reported that in 2023 it “stayed focused on constantly improving (the) user experience, lowering costs and increasing efficiency.” Xu indicated that its focus on users’ experience had enabled it to obtain many new users who were spending a relatively large amount of money on the platform, and the CEO stated that the firm’s “user momentum” had accelerated in Q1. Also noteworthy is that, in Q4 and all of 2023, the average amount of time spent by each user on the platform had increased. Finally, Xu reported that the firm’s “order volume” had climbed by “double-digit” percentage levels in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nTaken together, this data makes me confident that JD’s performance is improving while the outlook of its e-commerce business is strong.\n\nOn the valuation front, the shares have a very low forward price-earnings ratio of eight times. Moreover, its price-sales ratio of 0.27 times is even more miniscule. The company’s valuation is especially attractive because analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to rise to $3.15 this year from $3.06 last year before increasing to $3.54 in 2025.\n\nUnderestimating the Chinese Economy and Gauging the Impact of JD.com’s Share Buybacks\n\nMuch of the Street has been quite bearish on China’s economy in recent months. And indeed, there are reasons to be cautious about its outlook. Specifically, the country’s GDP increased just 1% in Q4 of last year versus Q3, while its residential real estate sector has major problems and many U.S. firms, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are moving portions of their supply chains out of the East Asian country.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, in past columns, I’ve noted that these Chinese government’s stimulus efforts have generally worked well over the years, making me confident that it can repeat the feat during the current cycle. And my prediction appears, at least to some extent, to be proving accurate as China’s GDP did increase at a 5.2% annual rate in Q4, up from a 4.9% gain in Q3. Moreover, in Q1, its GDP growth accelerated further, reaching 5.3%.\n\nAccording to TheNew York Times, the country’s investments in its manufacturing sector helped boost its economic growth last quarter. Also noteworthy is that the nation’s retail sales expanded at a 4.7% annual clip in Q1. While The Times characterized the latter increase as “modest,” I view it as rather impressive, particularly given widespread concerns about the country’s economy.\n\nOf course, all of this generally positive economic data in general and the country’s strong retail sales growth in particular will likely boost JD.com\n\nAlso likely to lift JD’s shares are its large share buybacks. The company bought back roughly $500 million of its shares last quarter, and it has $2.5 billion remaining on its share buyback initiative which expires in March 2027. JD’s large buybacks also indicate that the company has performance in the outlook of its own shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "If you’re looking for growth stocks with huge gains for your next investment, there’s really no need to mess around. You want to find the biggest and best names in the market that have a track record in recent quarters of providing extraordinary growth.\n\nWhile investors like Warren Buffett lean toward value stocks – a stock that is fundamentally cheap based on ratios like price-to-earnings or price-to-book, – growth stocks are more about the end result. Some of the names on this list have crazy fundamentals, but they that’s only because their returns are so strong. Growth stocks are those that are growing or expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market or the overall economy.\n\nThese companies are hyper-focused on expanding their businesses, reinvesting earnings into expanding operations or developing new products.  Growth stocks with huge gains can help investors build wealth over the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to identify the best candidates for growth in the market today. And here’s a spoiler alert – you’ve surely heard of many of the high-profile names on this list.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve written about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) a lot in the last few months, and I’m going to continue to beat the drum for this dynamic growth stock. Nvidia is one of the best names you can buy because of its unique position in the semiconductor industry and its key role in fueling the growth of generative artificial intelligence applications.\n\nNvidia manufactures about 90% of the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used in generative AI. That’s led to the company soaring in valuation and market capitalization – Nvidia is now the third-most valuable company in the world, with a market cap above $2.1 trillion.\n\nNow Nvidia is going to be even better. It’s replacing the H100 processors currently in use with Blackwell processors that will be four times as powerful as H100 processors.\n\nOne thing to note – NVDA stock is actually down about 6% in the last month because some investors are worried that sales will temporarily falter if customers hold off on new purchases while they wait for the Blackwell processors to go on the market. And maybe that will happen. But I’m taking this brief break as a buying opportunity because I’m convinced that Nvidia has a lot more growth left in it.\n\nNVDA stock remains up 70% this year and more than 200% higher than a year ago. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an overall “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is Nvidia’s top competitor. Truthfully, AMD was left in the dust in 2023 as Nvidia sales skyrocketed. But now AMD is in a position to begin providing an alternative to Nvidia’s chips. And it has a definite advantage in the personal computer market as well.\n\nAMD is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue this year from its Mi300 GPU accelerator. AMD also provides AI-compatible central processing units (CPUs) for the PC market, where it still has a competitive advantage.\n\nAnalysts at Baird expect “comfortable upside” to AMD this year and reiterated its “outperform” rating while setting a $200 price target. That’s a healthy target, particularly since AMD is affected by Beijing’s recently announced plan to phase out the use of AMD chips from government PCs and servers. AMD gets about 15% of its revenue from mainland China, so the news impacted AMD stock.\n\nBut I’m still confident. AMD is too strong a growth play to ignore here. The stock is up 70% in the last year and gets a “B” grade for growth and an overall “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) is another name that’s been on my radar screen in recent months. The company made its mark by using AI to provide real-time analysis and suggestions to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.\n\nBut in recent quarters, Palantir is growing the business on the commercial side – and that’s where the real growth will be. Revenue from commercial clients grew by 32% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, reaching $284 million. By contrast, Palantir’s signature military revenue was $324 million but grew only 5%.\n\nPalantir also has a software deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that will make some of its products, including AI software, deployable on Oracle’s platform.\n\nTheStreet Pro analyst Bruce Kamich has a $48 price target on PLTR stock, which would be a 125% increase from today’s prices. I think it’s certainly achievable. PLTR stock is up 142% in the last 12 months and gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the companies that first brought generative AI into the public arena. It was a gamechanger when OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in late 2022, and Microsoft, with a 49% stake in the company, had a lot to do with that development. Microsoft already uses OpenAI in many of its products.\n\nBut Microsoft isn’t finished yet – not by a long shot. It’s building a new AI hub in London that is expected to  “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models.”\n\nAnd here’s something else to consider: Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says that generative AI is giving Microsoft an “iPhone moment.” Think about that for a moment. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changed the world when it unveiled the iPhone which was the first mass-marketed smartphone. And it changed the trajectory of Apple stock for decades.\n\nIf generative AI is truly Microsoft’s “iPhone moment,” the Microsoft could be seeing a long period of sustained growth.\n\nMSFT stock is up 43% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) is another company that is using AI to its advantage. The company utilizes AI for voice recognition products, such as one geared toward vehicle owners that lets them access their owners’ manual and ask questions about vehicle features.\n\nEmployee Assist is another great SoundHound product that provides audio instructions to an employee who makes a verbal request about job functions.\n\nThe stock took off in a big way in mid-February when Nvidia disclosed an ownership position in the company. And even though the stock has pulled back in recent weeks to less than $5 per share, the partnership with Nvidia and SoundHound is too appealing for me to ignore.\n\nSoundHound is also planning to sell as much as $150 million in new shares – an announcement that contributed to the stock’s recent slide, but I see as a sign that the company is one of the most compelling growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nSOUN stock remains up 80% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most important companies in the world. It more than dominates the internet search market. In fact, it has a near monopoly, with a 95% market share for its Google search engine. That gives Alphabet an unmatched profit center for its advertising business.\n\nAnd remember, Alphabet is a lot more than just Google. The company operates YouTube, Waze, Nest, Fitbit and more.\n\nBut one place where Alphabet has not made waves is with AI – at least, until very recently. GOOG stock jumped higher this month on a flurry of AI developments that are long overdue for a company as revolutionary as Alphabet. It’s creating in-house designed data center CPUs, launching a new AI-powered text-to-video application, and its introducing AI-powered add-ons to its subscription-based software products.\n\nAlphabet will report quarterly earnings in late April. And even if there are short-term headwinds, I’m confident in GOOG stock as a long-term growth play.\n\nGOOG is up 48% in the last year. It gets a “B” rating for growth and a “B” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew companies have the reach as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger and WhatsApp counts 3.98 billion people as monthly active users.\n\nThat enormous audience makes Meta an extremely attractive advertising platform, which is why Meta is working on harnessing the power of AI and machine learning to optimize its advertising offerings. Meta also unveiled its latest in-house artificial intelligence accelerator chip.\n\nAnalysts are reiterating “buy” or equivalent to “buy” ratings on shares and raising their quarterly earnings forecasts for META stock, which will issue its next quarterly earnings report on April 24.\n\nIf Meta beats those expectations, it could be an extremely good day for shareholders, which makes it one of the best growth stocks with huge gains.\n\nMETA stock is up 129% in the last year and 41% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating for growth and an “A” overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, PLTR and MSFT.

        "title": "Put $5,000 in These 7 Blue-Chip Stocks Today",
        "content": "If you’re looking for reliability in a crazed market, jump into safer blue-chip stocks.\n\nWhile they’re not all the most exciting stocks on the market, they have proven themselves to be ultra-reliable in any economic environment. They all have proven business models, strong track records, sales, reputations and oftentimes, dividends to boot. That’s because most offer products and services that millions of us use every day.\n\nEven better, after a recent pullback in the broader markets, some of the top blue-chip stocks are on sale. Look at AT&T (NYSE:T), for example. After testing a high of $17.59, it pulled back to $16.33, where it caught support and is just starting to pivot higher. Plus, it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, which tells us it’s overdue to bounce. And while you wait for the AT&T stock to recover, you can collect its yield of 6.8%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven more top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold today.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of Nike (NYSE:NKE) gapped from about $100 to a low of $88.80. However, it’s starting to pivot higher, and could soon refill that gap at around $100. Helping, Bank of America analysts just upgraded the NKE stock to a buy rating with a price target of $113. The firm argues NKE has a newer line up of footwear and apparel products. Plus, the upcoming Olympics should have a positive impact on the stock, too.\n\nJPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $164. The firm pointed to Nike’s improvement in China. In addition, Morgan Stanley says retailers are seeing improving sequential demand trends for athletic apparel.\n\nBetter, earnings negativity has been priced into the stock. Investors weren’t too enthused when the company said growth was near zero, or that management expected for revenue to pull back in the first half of fiscal 2025, which starts in June. But again, that appears to be priced in.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere’s also “The Monthly Dividend Company,” Realty Income (NYSE:O).\n\nWith a yield of 5.93%, the real estate investment trust (REIT) is also a buy on weakness. In fact, after slipping from $54.39 to $50.65, it’s now starting to pivot higher again. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its monthly dividend. Its latest one for 25.7 cents is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. This is the company’s 646th consecutive monthly dividend with many more on the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income has been around for more than 50 years now. It has 13,100 properties, and it’s still seeing strong demand with an occupancy rate of 99%.\n\nSome of its top tenants include Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Walgreen’s (NASDAQ:WBA), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), BJ’s (NYSE:BJ), CVS (NYSE:CVS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to name just a few. It’s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nFidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (FBCG) Fidelity sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at low cost with blue-chip stocks, there’s always an exchange-traded fund, such as the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth ETF (CBOE:FBCG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF “focuses on companies we believe have above-average earnings growth potential with sustainable business models, for which the market has mispriced the rate and/or durability of growth,” as noted by Fidelity.\n\nTop holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to name a few.\n\nEven more impressive, since bottoming out at around $27 in late October, the ETF hit a high of about $39. It just recently pulled back with the broader market to $36.84. Now oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R, that weakness is an opportunity. From its current price of $36.84, I’d like to see the ETF challenge $40 a share initially.\n\nWhat’s nice about an ETF like this one is we can diversify with top blue-chip stocks. All for less than $37 a share at the moment.\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (VIG) vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot blue-chip ETF to consider is the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund (NYSEARCA:VIG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.06%, the VIG ETF currently yields 1.76%. its last payout of 76.92 cents was paid on March 27. The next one should be out by June. It also holds 340 stocks, including Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). All in its effort to track the performance of the S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $150, the VIG ETF ran to a high of $183.02. Since then, it has dipped to $173.63, where it’s over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price, I’d like to see it initially retest $182.07 and head to $200 near term.\n\nWhat’s nice about this ETF is we can gain exposure to 340 of the world’s top stocks. All for less than $175 a share at the moment. Plus, we can collect its yield as it appreciates.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which we’re all familiar with.\n\nWith a yield of 2.56%, the consumer goods company is also a buy on recent weakness. After pulling back from about $160, it’s now technically oversold at $157.29. It’s also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R and is just starting to pivot higher. Initially, I’d like to see the PG stock retest its prior high and push to at least $170 near term.\n\nIt also just raised its quarterly dividend to $1.0065, a 7% jump from its prior dividend of 94.07 cents. It’s payable on May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 19.\n\nHelping, Barclays just reiterated a buy rating on the PG stock with a price target of $168. Analysts at Deutsche Bank also raised their price target to $172 with a buy rating. The firm says “year-to-date consumption trends for Procter remain solid in tracked channels. The firm sees little risk to near-term earnings numbers given the company’s ongoing productivity momentum and relative cost favorability,” as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) An angled side view of a row of parked cars. automotive stock picks\n\nSource: lumen-digital / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last time I mentioned Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC), it traded at $135 on Nov. 17.\n\nAt the time, I noted, “Use the weakness as an opportunity. While we wait for the eventual recovery here, we can collect its 2.76% yield. We can profit from capital appreciation, and get paid to wait.” Just a few months later, GPC is now up to $160.23 and could see higher highs.\n\nNow yielding 2.5%, the stock rocketed 11.2% higher on Thursday after raising its fiscal year 2024 profit guidance. For the year, it expected to post EPS of $8.95 to $9.15. Now it expects to post EPS of $9.05 to $.9.20, which boosted investor confidence.\n\nEven better, its dividend – which has been increased consistently for 67 years – is safe. In the first three months of 2024, the company said it “used $175 million in cash for financing activities, including $133 million for quarterly dividends paid to shareholders and $38 million for stock repurchases. Free cash flow was $203 million.”\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks good on weakness, too.\n\nAfter dropping to $58.18 from $61, it’s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams’ %R. But it is starting to bounce back fast. From its last traded price of $58.91, I’d like to see it retest $61. Better, while we wait for it to recover, we can collect its yield of about 3.3%. Its latest dividend of 48.5 cents was recently paid out on April 1. Annualized, it’s $1.94 and is the company’s 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase.\n\nPlus, “The company returned $8 billion in dividends to shareowners in 2023, bringing the total amount of dividends paid to shareowners since Jan. 1, 2010, to $84.7 billion,” as noted in a recent press release. Helping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on KO to $68 with an overweight rating. All as the company continues to grow its revenue, as the global soft drink market continues to explode.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "7 Deadly Dividend Stocks to Avoid at All Costs: April 2024",
        "content": "While dividend stocks can be a good option for investors looking for an available revenue stream, not every dividend stock is worth your time. Plenty of deadly dividend stocks are ready to wreak havoc on your portfolio.\n\nThe worst thing about a deadly dividend stock is the inconsistency. You want to have a reliable payout schedule so you can plan your finances accordingly. You also want a dividend stock with a history of maintaining or growing its payout.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the first things a struggling company will do is cut the dividend, especially if it needs the cash to pay off debt or if profits are taking a beating.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors who rely on dividends as a source of income may find it challenging to budget or plan for the future when dividend payments are suddenly cut.\n\nWe’re using the Portfolio Grader to help weed out the deadly dividend stocks you should avoid in April 2024.\n\nEvaluate stocks based on earnings, growth, dividends, momentum, and analyst sentiment for success in Q2.\n\nYou can avoid the deadly dividend stocks that will sink your returns.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is actually more than a smartphone manufacturer. It makes and sells personal computers, wearable technology, tablets and more.\n\nIts powerful Services segment includes the App Store where Apple allows developers to market their apps to the public. Apple gets a piece of that action, making it one of the company’s most profitable ventures.\n\nThen there’s the downside. Apple’s seen iPhone sales slip, particularly in China where sales in the first six weeks of the year were down 24%. Sales of other products are also down, but not nearly as much as the iPhone in China.\n\nThat means Apple needs to find a way to compete with China’s homegrown smartphone maker, Huawei, or find a way to replace that revenue.\n\nIt does all that as both U.S. and U.K. regulators are looking into the App Store for possibly illegally blocking the competition.\n\nApple stock offers a dividend yield of just 0.5%, which isn’t nearly enough to cover its 13% loss in 2024. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) is an Arizona company that makes microcontroller, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP products. Its customers are in the industrial, automotive, consumer, communications, computing and aerospace markets.\n\nThe company’s integrated circuits have been on the market for more than 20 years and are included in more than 100,000 products. Microchips are found in everyday products such as calculators, bank ATM, car infotainment systems and cell phones.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company makes important products, the stock has been maddingly inconsistent, with numerous price swings over the last 12 months.\n\nThe stock is down 6% since Jan. 1 on the heels of reporting weak earnings in the last quarter (Q3 of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023).\n\nRevenue was $1.76 billion, a drop of 18.6% from a year ago and short of the company’s guidance. Microchip blamed the issue on weaker business conditions and lowered demand.\n\nCEO Ganesh Moorthy says the company will cut discretionary spending and manage inventory in the near term.\n\nMCHP provides a dividend yield of 2%. It gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a sizable real estate investment trust with over 13,000 properties. Realty Income has interests in every U.S. state. That’s a huge footprint. Plus, it works with customers in 90 industries.\n\nThe biggest issue for Realty Income is debt. Borrowing money to purchase properties cost a lot more when interest rates are higher. That’s why even though Realty Income saw a significant increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, its income dropped.\n\nOne positive thing about Realty Income is the generous dividend yield of 6% that’s paid monthly. But I’m going to be skeptical of O stock until interest rates come back down to a more manageable level.\n\nO stock is down 9% this year and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (USB) The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) isn’t the biggest bank in the country, but it’s pretty close.\n\nIt ranks as the No. 5 banking company in size in the United States, primarily serving the 26 states in the Midwest and Western U.S.\n\nMany banks, including U.S. Bancorp, have been troubled by the interest rate issue. The company has been forced to offer higher interest rates on deposit accounts to customers to prevent them from shifting their money into high-yielding bonds.\n\nThat strategy weighs directly on the company’s bottom line, with first-quarter earnings showing that profits at U.S. Bancorp dropped 22% from a year ago.\n\nIt also lowered its guidance on net interest income, the money banks pay customers and what they earn on interest on loans.\n\nUSB previously guided for income net interest income of $16.6 billion for the full year, but now says it will be somewhere from a range between $16.1 billion and $16.4 billion.\n\nUSB stock pays a dividend yield of nearly 5%, but the stock is down more than 8% this year and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Co. (NYSE:F) is a well-known member of the Big Three Detroit automakers. The stock pays a solid dividend yield of nearly 5%.\n\nSo what’s not to love? Plenty, as it turns out.\n\nFord has to compete with other automakers, particularly Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) which is singlehandedly driving down the price of electric vehicles. Tesla cut prices in 2023 and 2024 as it seeks to boost its sales numbers.\n\nI don’t think it’s a great strategy because it eats into the profit margin – and investors hate it when a company’s profitability suffers. Now Ford is going through the same issue.\n\nFord cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E electric SUV by up to $8,100, and its cutting prices on its 2024 Ford F-150 Lighting, and all-electric pickup.\n\nNext week the company is reporting first-quarter earnings and I want to see how the profit numbers hold up.\n\nF stock is down 1% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLowe’s Companies (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) is primarily known for its giant brick-and-mortar home improvement stores.\n\nIt peddles everything that you need to build a house, complete a major construction project, plant a tree or simply decorate your patio.\n\nThe company has more than 1,700 home improvement or outlet stores in the U.S., covering every state and the District of Columbia. And while shares were soaring earlier this year, there’s trouble on the horizon and LOW stock is already feeling the heat.\n\nIn reporting its fourth-quarter and full year 2023 earnings in February, Lowe’s disclosed that it expects sales to drop by 2% to 3% in 2024. And profits will also take a hit, with earnings per share expected to fall by more than 7%.\n\nThat’s enough to send investors scurrying, and LOW stock is down 10% in the last six weeks alone.\n\nLOW stock pays a dividend yield of 2% and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS) A General Mills (GIS) sign on a General Mills office in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS) is best known for its iconic breakfast foods from Cheerios ro Progresso soups and Green Giant vegetables.\n\nAll that sounds great. But sales are down as of late.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, General Mills reported sales down 1% to $5.1 billion.\n\nThat was a better outlook than the previous quarter, when the company was forced to lower its organic sales guidance from a previous range of 3% to 4% to just 1%.\n\nThat’s why you should treat General Mills with caution, even though the stock is up 6% on the year and its pays a decent dividend yield of 3.4%.\n\nAll in all, there are worse stocks than General Mills. But there are much better dividend stocks you can buy as well, so avoid this “D” rated stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple's FineWoven cases and watch bands, costed between £99 and £149\n\nApple has reportedly suspended production of vegan phone cases it started selling less than a year ago.\n\nThe tech giant is said to have stopped making its FineWoven cases and watch straps following complaints that the £59 cases would become easily scratched and worn out.\n\nApple introduced the material, a “microtwill” made up of recycled textiles and other fibres, last September when it announced that it would no longer produce leather accessories as part of an environmental push.\n\nThe business has committed to its supply chain being completely carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nWhen it introduced the FineWoven cases and watch bands, which cost between £99 and £149, Apple said they had a “sophisticated look” and a “significantly lower carbon footprint than leather”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the accessories have been plagued by complaints that they deteriorate after a few days of use, with scratches and scuffs remaining on the fabric and the cases attracting dust and fluff. Others have complained that the cases are slippery compared to their leather predecessors.\n\nThe cases are frequently returned, according to their Amazon listing.\n\nApple was reported to have suspended production of the FineWoven cases by an anonymous Twitter account that is widely known for leaking details from the company’s supply chain.\n\nThe account, known as Kosutami, had previously revealed the company’s plan to introduce the recycled fabric cases before Apple announced them in September. It said that the company would find an alternative material.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast week, it published a new advert promoting the move to ditch leather that did not mention the FineWoven cases. It announced new colours for its cheaper silicone cases and watch straps last month but did not refresh the FineWoven range.\n\nSuspending production could mean the company will continue to sell the cases before announcing an alternative at an upcoming event, such as the annual iPhone launch in September.\n\nApple has made a series of product changes in recent years in an attempt to meet its environmental targets, including using recycled materials in its phones, cutting the amount of packaging, and no longer including headphones and charging cables.",

        "title": "It's Time to Ditch These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks and Replace Them With 2 Bona Fide Outperformers",
        "content": "Within the past couple of weeks, all three major stock indexes powered their way to fresh record-closing highs. While there have been pockets of strength throughout the broader market, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that are widely credited with lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to new heights.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven, as the name implies, are seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. These seven components are (in descending order of market cap):\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAside from crushing the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over the trailing-10-year period, the Magnificent Seven have undeniable competitive advantages. Examples include:\n\nNvidia controlling upwards of 90% of all graphics processing units deployed in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated enterprise data centers. Amazon being the leader in U.S. e-commerce retail market share and global cloud infrastructure service spend (via Amazon Web Services). Alphabet's Google accounting for an estimated 91% of worldwide internet search share in March, per GlobalStats.\n\nBut not all of the Magnificent Seven components are ultimately \"magnificent.\" To be brutally honest, some have been nothing short of operating duds over the past year. What follows are two Magnificent Seven stocks that should be sent to the chopping block, as well as the two phenomenal businesses that can logically replace them.\n\nIt's time to ditch this Magnificent Seven component: Tesla\n\nAs I stated plainly in late February, the Tesla growth story is officially dead. While the company has amassed a healthy cash pile to navigate a turbulent market for electric vehicles (EVs), and it's driven its first-mover advantages to four consecutive years of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit, Tesla is a shell of what it was once advertised to be.\n\nTo begin with, the company has been aggressively reducing the sales price of Model's 3, S, X, and Y since the start of 2023. Between Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2023, Tesla's operating margin was more-than-halved to 8.2%. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that EV demand dictates his company's pricing strategy. Yet even with aggressive price cuts, inventory levels have been stubbornly climbing.\n\nAnother issue with Tesla is that its efforts to become more than a car company have largely fallen flat. While it deserves credit for becoming the charging network of choice by many EV makers in the U.S., its Energy Generation and Storage sales growth has stalled, while its gross margin for Services remains stuck in the low-single-digits. Tesla's sales and profitability are dependent on its ability to sell and lease EVs -- and that's a segment that's under serious pressure right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I've highlighted in the past, Tesla also generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from unsustainable sources that include interest income on its cash and regulatory tax credits. This makes the company's premium valuation all the more egregious.\n\nTesla is an auto company losing its first-mover advantages that, in my view, has no business being viewed as a Magnificent Seven component. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt's also time to put this Magnificent Seven constituent out to pasture: Apple\n\nThe other Magnificent Seven stock that should be given the proverbial heave-ho is tech titan Apple.\n\nOn the bright side, Apple's iPhone still dominates in the U.S., and the company's subscription-powered Services segment has been its most-consistent performer for years. Further, the $651 billion in share repurchases Apple has undertaken since the start of 2013 is tops among all public companies. A steady diet of buybacks has provided a boost to Apple's earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe concern with Apple is that its growth engine has completely stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended in late September), sales declined in all of Apple's physical product segments. Through the first three months of fiscal 2024, iPad and Wearables generated double-digit percentage sales declines from the prior-year period.\n\nTo make matters worse, preliminary research data released from IDC last week shows that Apple's iPhone shipments declined by 9.6% to 50.1 million units from the previous year. iPhone is the company's top revenue driver.\n\nWhen Apple was valued at 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings, no one batted an eye if the company endured a growth hiccup. But at 27 times forecast EPS for the current fiscal year, a second consecutive year of zero or negative growth is too much of an eyesore to sweep under the rug.\n\nApple's best growth days may well be in the rearview mirror -- and for that reason, it no longer belongs in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe first outperformer that deserves its spot among the Magnificent Seven: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nIf Tesla and Apple are shown the door, the first no-brainer company that should be viewed as a true Magnificent Seven component is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nWhile it's true that Berkshire isn't an innovator in the same capacity as either Tesla or Apple, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment team have led Berkshire to virtually unmatched annualized returns dating back more than a half-century. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen a nearly 20% annualized return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), and nearly doubled up the average annual total return, including dividends, of the S&P 500.\n\nThree catalysts continue to make Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders richer over time. First off, Buffett and his team have a lengthy track record of generating big-time returns in the stock market. Berkshire's $361 billion investment portfolio contains 45 stocks and two index funds, with a heavy concentration in just four stocks (one of which happens to be Apple).\n\nSecondly, Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly five dozen businesses, which have helped grow its operating revenue and income. Some of Berkshire's fully owned subsidiaries include insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF. A portfolio weighted heavily to cyclical businesses gets to take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion.\n\nThe third reason Berkshire's stock keeps climbing is because Warren Buffett has given the green light to more than $74 billion worth of share buybacks since July 2018. These buybacks are increasing Berkshire's EPS and making its stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused long-term investors.\n\nA second outperformer that's proven it's magnificent: Visa\n\nThe other outstanding company that makes for a logical replacement for Tesla or Apple in the Magnificent Seven is payment processor Visa(NYSE: V).\n\nWhile not an apples-to-apples comparison, you could certainly argue that Tesla and Apple are more innovative than Visa. But few companies have delivered for their shareholders on a more consistent basis than Visa has since its initial public offering in March 2008.\n\nIn the U.S., no payment processor accounts for a higher share of credit card network purchase volume than Visa. It was also the only payment facilitator in the U.S. that gained substantial share following the Great Recession. Since economic expansions last substantially longer than recessions, Visa benefits from the disproportionate long-term growth in spending from consumers and businesses.\n\nIt also has a lengthy growth runway beyond domestic borders. Emerging market regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia remain underbanked. Visa has the ability to organically expand its infrastructure into these markets, as well as quickly reach new regions by making acquisitions, just as it did in 2016 when it acquired Visa Europe.\n\nBest of all, Visa's management team has steered clear of becoming a lender. This strategic move ensures that it won't have to set aside capital during inevitable recessions to deal with credit delinquencies and loan losses. This is a competitive edge that's helped Visa maintain a juicy profit margin north of 50%.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is likely in for some fresh legal entanglements after recommending stockholders vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk’s multi-billion-dollar compensation package — no matter what the final tally reveals at the company's June annual meeting.\n\n\"I think regardless of whether the vote is approved or not, it's going to be challenged in the Delaware courts,\" said Marc Steinberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law.\n\nBecause of the billions at stake, \"chances are you're going to attract shareholder derivative and class-action type lawsuits,\" added Jerry Comizio, a business law professor at American University's Washington College of Law. Tesla CEO Elon Musk. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMusk's pay was struck down in January by a Delaware judge who found that Tesla's directors had breached their fiduciary duty when they awarded Musk the largest compensation opportunity ever granted to a public company executive. The ruling came after a shareholder sued to challenge the pay package.\n\nMusk's incentive-based pay, had it not been invalidated by the Delaware court, would now be worth roughly $47 billion following a fall in the value of Tesla’s stock. At the time of the ruling it had been worth up to $56 billion.\n\nTesla used a preliminary proxy filing last week to ask shareholders to re-vote on this pay package, arguing it had cured the conditions that led Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to void Musk’s compensation in January.\n\nIt did so, the board claimed, by forming a single-member special committee to evaluate Musk's pay package using independent director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson — and by following Wilson-Thompson's recommendation for a new shareholder vote that came after third parties assisted the company with \"rigorous and thoughtful analysis.\"\n\nMcCormick threw out Musk’s pay because of what she called \"extensive ties\" between Musk and the people negotiating the pay package and a lack of public disclosure about Musk’s relationships with those who approved the deal. In this courtroom sketch Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left, testifies before Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, seated right, in 2022. A stenographer is seated at center. (Elizabeth Williams via AP) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe company is separately asking its shareholders to approve a move of Tesla’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas — a move called for by Musk after the Delaware judge voided his pay.\n\n\"2024 is the year that Tesla should move home to Texas,\" Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm said in her letter to shareholders included in the proxy statement.\n\nThe re-authorization of Musk's pay, Tesla argued to shareholders in its new filing, is needed to incentivize Musk’s future leadership of Tesla.\n\n\"Because the Delaware court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value,\" the company said in its filing.\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal experts said those arguments might not be enough to keep shareholders from suing Tesla and the board all over again, arguing that the sole director who approved it was not independent enough from Musk. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm. (Photo by Alex Ellinghausen/Sydney Morning Herald via Getty Images) (Fairfax Media via Getty Images)\n\nShareholders could also argue that the company's disclosures around the deal still fell short.\n\nComizio cautions that a company's analysis of executive compensation typically involves a company-initiated peer review that helps the board set CEO pay within an appropriate range, and that without it, Tesla, to its peril, may have ignored deficiencies outlined by the Delaware court.\n\n\"At minimum, they've got to revamp the whole process of how they did this,\" Comizio said.\n\n\"When you adjust somebody’s compensation…if you’re doing a graph and the proposed compensation package looks like Mount Everest, that can be problematic.\"\n\nNot all legal experts agree.\n\nGunster's corporate law expert Bob Lamm argues that Tesla may have a decent claim against that peer review standard. Historically, he said, superstar founders such as Apple’s (AAPL) Steve Jobs and Amazon’s (AMZN) Jeff Bezos have been largely exempt from that scrutiny.\n\n\"It's questionable whether there are any peers for Elon Musk,\" Lamm said. \"So looking for comparable data is going to be tough.\"\n\nMusk's compensation plan reached in 2018 was around 33 times larger than the largest pay package in history, according to Greg Varallo, the shareholders' attorney in the Delaware case. The prior record also belonged to Musk, in a compensation deal reached in 2014.\n\nThe next step in this pay drama, before final votes are tallied June 13, is a likely review of Tesla’s proxy filing by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat review could require Tesla to amend its disclosure to shareholders about Musk’s proposed pay deal, according to Comizio.\n\nAt some point, however, there are no more disclosures to be made, Lamm said.\n\nBusiness courts in Delaware and other states have wide discretion to address what they view as inequities between companies and shareholders, but they don’t have the liberty to simply object to the amount of an executive's pay.\n\n“The problem that the courts have now is that they can’t say the [compensation] is too much,” Lamm said. “And you can’t disclose everything. At some point the court’s got to say: \"Tesla, you've done your job.”\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Secrets of 401(k) Millionaires",
        "content": "You already know the basics of building wealth in a 401(k) account, right? These game-changing tactics have been shared a million times, because they are undeniably powerful and always a good idea:\n\nMax out your 401(k) contributions every month. Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, too. Get started as early as possible and leave your money untouched for as long as you can.\n\nI mean, yeah. Sticking to these principles forever will almost certainly make you a millionaire someday. The strategy is both tried and true. The details will vary with your annual salary, the cost of living in your area, the percentage your employer will add to your 401(k)-bound paycheck deductions, boom and bust cycles in the future economy, and more.\n\nIn most cases, staying true to these three golden rules for at least three decades will probably get you a card to the millionaire club in the end.\n\nBut did you know that you can reach that million-dollar goal without pushing the pedal all the way to the metal?\n\nIt's true. You can make a million in your 401(k) retirement savings account without maxing out the key principles above. The overarching secret to the millionaire-making retirement strategy is that it's easier than you think.\n\nOn that note, let me show you three simple ways you can get away with lowering your effort and still retire as a millionaire.\n\nReasonable assumptions\n\nEvery situation is unique, so I can't review every possible complication here. I can set up some reasonable assumptions based on national averages, though. As you'll soon find out, there's wiggle room with every metric and you should spend some time with a handy 401(k) calculator, like this CalcXML tool:\n\n*Calculator is for estimation purposes only, and is not financial planning or advice. As with any tool, it is only as accurate as the assumptions it makes and the data it has, and should not be relied on as a substitute for a financial advisor or a tax professional.\n\nTo use this calculator, you'll need to input some key information, including:\n\nThe number of years you have until retirement Your current 401(k) balance Your current 401(k) contribution, as a percentage of your salary Your employer's 401(k) match Your anticipated returns on your 401(k) investments prior to and during retirement The length of time you expect to need money in retirement\n\nFor the discussion below, I'm working with a base case of 30 years until retirement (from age 35 to 65, for example), current annual income of $60,000, annual salary increases of 2%, no starting funds in the 401(k) account, and contributing 8% of your annual pay to the 401(k) plan with a 50% employer match (which works out to 4% of your annual pay).\n\nStory continues\n\nThese numbers are close to national averages, erring on the conservative side. Unless otherwise noted, I left the remaining default figures untouched. The \"moderate\" case with annual investment returns of 8% lands at a total value of $1.1 million in 30 years -- just a hair above the million-dollar target balance. Chart source: CalcXML.\n\n1. Time in the market beats everything else\n\nIn my example, you'll contribute $4,800 in the first year -- let's call it 2024 -- and $6,470 in 2054. Matching contributions from your employer will start at $2,400 and reach $3,235 in the last year. Your cumulative money contributions add up to nearly $300,000.\n\nIn other words, more than two-thirds of your nest egg will be the result of investment returns.\n\nAnd that's just the \"moderate\" scenario with a compound annual growth rate of 8%. In reality, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index has delivered an 8.4% CAGR over the last 30 years, a period including some of the worst market dips in history. And if you had the foresight to reinvest dividends along the way, you'd have an annual return of 10.5%: ^SPX Chart\n\nThe dividend-boosted long-term average is close to the \"aggressive\" returns in the example above. That's worth nearly $2 million after 30 years. So even the modest investment rates I'm looking at should easily beat the million-dollar goal in three decades.\n\n2. You don't always need \"market-beating returns\" or exceptional investment ideas\n\nYes, your wealth can grow faster if your particular 401(k) plan lets you select individual stocks, and you happen to find some big winners. Maybe you work for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), who offer robust 401(k) options with market-trouncing stock returns in the long run. Extra money is always better, of course. But you can still be a 30-year millionaire without winning the stock-picking lottery.\n\n3. ETFs can make it simple to match long-term market returns\n\nAll you need is a simple exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking a solid market index with low annual fees.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) springs to mind, offering a near-perfect match to the leading market index's returns with microscopic management fees and a super-simple dividend reinvestment function.\n\nIt's also pretty safe to track American blue-chip stocks with Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: DIA). More ambitious investors could opt for the Invesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ: QQQ), which follows the NASDAQ Composite Index -- a more volatile option that tends to outperform the S&P 500 when the time period is measured in decades.\n\nLike the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, these exchange-traded funds match the returns of solid market indices with low annual fees. Feel free to mix and match them, too. There are no wrong answers as long as you're sticking with robust, low-fee performers.\n\nAnd as the tool above shows, that's all you need in the long run. Your future millionaire self will thank you for starting your 401(k) contributions today.\n\nThe $22,924 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\n\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $22,924 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

        "content": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff admits he'd ‘be a lot richer’ if he'd just invested in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "title": "2 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite has increased by 97% in the last five years and 286% in the past decade, proving the value of holding stocks over the long term. Stocks in this index have made many millionaires over the years and will likely continue to make more as industries such as tech and retail develop. AAPL Chart\n\nCostco(NASDAQ: COST) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are attractive investment options. The preceding table shows that they have significantly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite since 2019.\n\nThese companies dominate their respective industries and have built immense consumer loyalty over the years. Costco has massive growth potential as it continues to expand abroad. Meanwhile, Apple is pivoting to digital services and artificial intelligence (AI), which could pay off significantly in the coming years.\n\nSo here are two magnificent stocks that have created millionaires and will continue to make more.\n\n1. Costco\n\nCostco is a retail stock but has behaved like a tech stock in recent years with its impressive growth.\n\nThe following chart shows that Costco's shares have delivered significantly more gains than some of its biggest retail competitors, including Amazon, Walmart, and Target, over the past five years. COST Chart\n\nConsumers worldwide have embraced Costco's wholesale business model, which involves an annual membership for access to market-low prices. In fact, the company boasts a membership renewal rate of 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 91% globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco has barely scratched the surface of its international expansion. The company currently operates 876 stores across 14 countries. Yet six of those countries have six or fewer locations, illustrating its growth potential. And that's before considering the many countries Costco has yet to enter.\n\nSince 2019, Costco's annual revenue has risen 71%, with operating income up 59%. The company is on a promising path, with seemingly endless opportunities for growth in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, Costco's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of just over 1 could make now an excellent time to invest. P/S is calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. A good P/S usually hovers around 1 to 2, indicating that its stock is trading at an attractive value.\n\nAlongside a quickly expanding retail business, Costco is a magnificent stock worth considering right now.\n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Costco, Apple is well acquainted with consumer loyalty. The company dominates consumer tech, with leading market shares in categories such as smartphones, headphones, smartwatches, and more.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting mogul Warren Buffett aptly conveyed the potency of Apple's brand in 2023, saying, \"If someone offered you $10,000 to never buy an iPhone again, you wouldn't take it.\" It's a bold statement that rings true for millions of consumers who have stuck with the company through multiple generations of iPhones and have branched out to its many other products and services.\n\nApple has strategically created an interconnected product ecosystem that keeps consumers returning. Exclusive apps such as Messages and FaceTime make it difficult for shoppers to consider competing brands. Meanwhile, the connectivity between devices including its iPhones, computers, tablets, and more promotes ease of use, which is too good of an argument to stray from Apple.\n\nApple's success has seen annual revenue rise 47% over the past five years, while operating income increased by 79%. Meanwhile, free cash flow hit $107 billion last year, outperforming competitors Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon.\n\nIf you've followed Apple at all recently, you probably know the company has hit a few roadblocks over the past year. Macroeconomic headwinds saw it post four consecutive quarters of revenue declines in 2023, a trend finally broken in Q1 2024, when the company posted revenue growth of 2% year over year as it beat analyst expectations by more than $1 billion. As a result, the company appears to be on a promising growth trajectory that could make its stock a good long-term option.\n\nDespite recent challenges, Apple's services business has remained a bright spot, with revenue in the segment rising 11% in Q1 2024. Apple is also expanding its focus on the budding AI market. The company's stock jumped 4% on April 11, when Bloomberg reported that Apple would overhaul its Mac lineup to better enable AI capabilities.\n\nThe company's vast cash resources and potent brand are likely to propel it far in AI over the next decade as it leverages its massive user base to expand in the market. AMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nApple's significant free cash flow has potentially made its shares a bargain next to its rivals. This chart indicates that it has the lowest price-to-free cash among some of its biggest rivals, making Apple one of the best-valued stocks in the arena.\n\nApple company has made a lot of millionaires over the years, but I wouldn't bet against seeing it make more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

In the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30, 2023), devices generated $96 billion in revenue, accounting for 81% of the total.\n\nBut Apple produced $23 billion in sales from something else entirely during the three-month period. Is this budding segment enough of a reason to consider buying this top Warren Buffett stock?\n\nCreating Apple's ecosystem\n\nBuffett once argued that if you offered someone $10,000 on the condition that they could never use an iPhone again for the rest of their life, they'd likely decline that deal. This not only points to the popularity of the world's most successful smartphone, but it also demonstrates the power of Apple's ecosystem.\n\nThat ecosystem not only consists of different hardware devices, but of various services as well. Apple's offerings -- including the App Store, News, Music, Pay, Fitness+, TV+, iCloud, and advertising -- raked in $23 billion in sales last quarter. This segment reported 11% revenue growth in Q1, a much faster pace than the company's products division. Even better, services boast a stellar gross margin of 73%.\n\nAs more revenue is derived from services, Apple's margin should trend higher over time. From a competitive standpoint, these services are what differentiate Apple in the industry. They result in loyal and sticky customers who don't want to leave the ecosystem. And they provide the business with a more predictable and recurring revenue stream.\n\nStill relying on hardware sales\n\nApple currently has more than 2.2 billion active devices across the world. That figure continues marching higher with each quarter. The company is getting more of its products into the hands of more consumers, which is obviously a positive trend.\n\nIt's not a surprise that as Apple expands its installed base of devices, its service revenue will also get a boost. On the other hand, if this installed base started to shrink for whatever reason, services would take a hit. This points to the fact that Apple depends on the ongoing success of its products to keep growing the services division.\n\nThat wouldn't be a problem if the hardware segment was registering strong growth. But it hasn't been. In fiscal 2023, Apple's overall sales declined 2.8%, with products posting a 6% drop. The iPhone remains the company's key revenue contributor. But it has entered a mature stage of its life cycle, with people less inclined to keep upgrading to the latest version.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bulls argue that with Apple expected to release greater artificial intelligence (AI) functionality, consumers will rush to upgrade to the newest iPhone model, while at the same time buying other products like the MacBook and iPad. This could reinvigorate the company's sales.\n\nAnalysts aren't that confident. They estimate revenue will rise at a compound annual rate of 4.5% between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2026, which is much slower projected growth than in the past.\n\nAs of this writing, Apple shares have fallen 12% so far this year, and they trade 14% below their all-time high. But don't rush to buy this Buffett stock just yet. It still sells at a steep valuation. Its current price-to-earnings ratio is 26.4, well above the trailing-10-year average.\n\nDespite Apple's expanding services division, I think investors should pass on the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Apple on Friday confirmed that it removed some apps from its Apple App Store in China at the request of the Chinese government.\n\nCiting a person familiar, the Journal reported that the Cyberspace Administration of China asked Apple to remove Meta-owned WhatsApp and Threads from the App Store \"because both contain political content that includes problematic mentions of the Chinese president,\" but the Apple spokesperson denied that was part of the reasoning.\n\nSAMSUNG OVERTAKES APPLE FOR TOP PHONEMAKER SPOT: REPORT\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party (CCP) keeps tight controls on what the nation's citizens are exposed to and suppresses political speech critical of the regime. Beijing has passed legislation and regulations to include specifications on what kinds of content should be prohibited online and bars pro-democracy media. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the unveiling of the Communist Party of China's new Politburo Standing Committee at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Oct. 23, 2022.\n\nChina's demand that Apple remove the apps suggests growing intolerance on the part of China's central government towards at least some foreign online messaging services that fall outside its control. It also signals less leeway for Apple in China, its largest overseas market.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nAMERICANS SHOULD ‘ABSOLUTELY BE CONCERNED’ ABOUT DATA COLLECTION, SPYING FROM CHINESE EVS: AUTO EXPERT\n\nThe move comes as the Senate prepares to take up a bill passed by the House last month that could see popular social media app TikTok banned in U.S. app stores if its China-based parent company, Bytedance, does not divest from it within 165 days of passage. It would also require the platform to be bought by a country that is not a U.S. adversary. Apple removed four apps from its App Store in China on Friday at the request of China's Cyberspace Administration.\n\nAccording to Reuters, other Meta apps including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download in China as of Friday, along with other popular apps developed by Western companies, including Google-owned YouTube and Elon Musk's X.\n\nFOX Business' Elizabeth Elkin and Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:China orders Apple to remove WhatsApp, Threads, other apps in censorship move: report\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. shares fell the most in nine months Friday, taking the shine off stellar first-quarter financial results following management’s decision to stop reporting quarterly subscriber data.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Israel Reported to Have Launched Retaliatory Strike on Iran Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding\n\nThis metric has long been the primary way Wall Street evaluated the company’s performance, but executives at Netflix, which now has almost 270 million subscribers, have tried to shift the focus to measures like sales and profit. Other tech giants like Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have taken similar steps in recent years.\n\nIn the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports.\n\nOn Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers.\n\n“Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors.\n\nNetflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere.\n\nIn 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.\n\nLast quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\n\nBeginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.”\n\nThe good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus.\n\nIn 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.\n\nNetflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well.\n\nIn explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant.\n\n“All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Adds background, detail from paragraph 3)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS, April 19 (Reuters) - Apple's offer to open its tap-and-go mobile payments system to rivals is set to be approved by EU antitrust regulators as soon as next month after it tweaked some of the terms, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nApple's bid to settle the four-year investigation would help it dodge a finding of wrongdoing and stave off a potential hefty fine that could be as much as 10% of its global annual turnover.\n\nApple's tap-and-go technology called near-field communication, or NFC, allows for contactless payments with mobile wallets.\n\nThe European Commission two years ago accused Apple of thwarting competition for its Apple Pay mobile wallet by preventing rival mobile wallets app developers from accessing its tap-and-go technology.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant in January offered to let rivals access its NFC on its iPhones, iPads and other Apple mobile devices free of charge without having to use Apple Pay or Apple Wallet, with access based on fair and non-discriminatory criteria.\n\nIt also offered to provide additional functionalities including defaulting of preferred payment apps, access to authentication features such as FaceID and a suppression mechanism, and also to set up a dispute settlement mechanism.\n\nApple was asked to tweak some of the terms following feedback from rivals and customers. The NFC proposal would be for 10 years.\n\nThe Commission aims to accept the offer by the summer, with May as the likeliest month although the timing could still change as it waits for Apple to work out the final technical details, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe company was hit with a 1.84 billion-euro ($2 billion) fine, its first EU antitrust penalty, last month for thwarting competition from Spotify and other music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store.

More than half of teens who own the Apple Vision Pro or similar devices rarely use them, which is a death knell for companies like Apple trying to target the next generation of tech consumers. To that end, Apple is strategically pivoting to market the Vision Pro as an ideal business/remote work tool. Priced at $3,500 and on the heels of Zuckerberg’s attempt to do the same, I’m not optimistic.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple may be heading for a lost decade (or worse) as it continually fails to innovate tech that excites consumers. Apple’s top sellers are simply iterations of existing products, and their new initiatives (beyond just the Vision Pro) tend to disappoint or die on the vine — Apple Car, anyone?\n\nUnderstandably, Vision Pro’s struggle is spooking investors bullish on VR stocks’ long-term potential. But don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Some decent VR stocks are still on the market, even if Apple is a stinker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 40% this year amid wider gaming sector struggles, Unity Software (NYSE:U) will likely suffer alongside Apple – but don’t sell this stock yet (even if it isn’t worth buying quite yet).\n\nOne of Cathie Wood’s top VR stock picks, her investment thesis is compelling. She recently dropped another few million into Unity, seeing it as a company at the forefront of the metaverse, gaming and VR sectors. Unity’s unmatched potential at the intersection of these key areas positions it as a premier VR choice for enhancing a digital tech portfolio. Still, this comes on the heels of multiple layoff rounds as Unity seeks to right-size itself in today’s economic climate — hence my feeling that the stock isn’t quite a Buy today.\n\nUnity’s unique value propositions are diverse and were highlighted in a White Brook Capitalreport. The analysts praised Unity’s “digital twin platform” for its distinct ability to replicate real-world objects, materials and people within a VR/metaverse context. Unlike many early-stage VR stocks, Unity generates positive cash flow through a robust advertising network. This profitability boosts Unity’s resilience against broader market uncertainties until VR stocks attract more widespread institutional interest.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) may be a major Apple partner, but the VR stock is sufficiently diversified that Apple’s ongoing woes shouldn’t have a major impact on per-share pricing. At the same time, its wider prospects make it an attractive buy, particularly at these levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond Apple, its joint venture with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) strengthens its hardware dominance and signals a promising future as VR markets continue to evolve.\n\nThe collaboration aims to create a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, leveraging Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware capabilities and Google’s investments in virtual reality tools. While the market awaits a definitive product announcement, industry analysts expect the partnership to produce a series of headsets that provide novel virtual reality experiences, potentially significantly increasing Qualcomm’s revenue.\n\nFurthermore, Qualcomm is consistently enhancing its extensive array of virtual reality products, including headsets. These products, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, incorporate the latest WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, pushing the boundaries of innovation in the VR space and establishing new industry standards.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Illustrative Editorial of Matterport's (MTTR stock) website homepage. MATTERPORT logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) has been on a losing streak. Its stock has dropped 30% since January, setting it up to lose the fight within the wider VR stocks landscape.\n\nAnalysts are increasingly bearish on the stock, with the vast majority agreeing that the VR stock will underperform in 2024. Though recent initiatives, including a strategic partnership with franchising gym chain Crunch Fitness, might be a move in the right direction, Matterport has a deep hole to dig itself out of.\n\nMatterport has faced challenges adapting to changing economic conditions that previously drove its stock up. In response, the company laid off 30% of its workforce as a cost-cutting measure. CEO RJ Pittman explained that the layoffs and other measures are intended to “sharpen our strategic focus and accelerate our path to profitability.” Pittman set forth this plan in 2023’s second quarter; thus far, his vision hasn’t been borne out for the VR stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 best cheap phones for 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Cheap Phones for 2024.\n\nOverview of the Global Smartphone Industry\n\nThe global smartphone industry is one of the fastest evolving industries and experiences regular updates and new smartphone devices to boost user experience and utility. According to a report by Mondor Intelligence, the global smartphone market was valued at $1.51 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.10% to reach $1.85 billion by 2029.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region holds the greatest market share mainly due to its highly developing telecommunication infrastructure and large customer base. Some of the leading countries with the most sophisticated technology infrastructure in the region include India, Indonesia, Japan, Australia, China, and South Korea. On April 5, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in collaboration with Indonesia’s telecommunication firm, PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison Tbk (IDX:ISAT), plans to invest $200 million in 2024 to build an artificial intelligence center in Surakarta, Indonesia. The AI center is expected to further boost Indonesia's technology infrastructure and include a human resource center.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) to secure the highest smartphone sales market share. Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) has led the smartphone market for over 12 years. However, in the fiscal 4th quarter of 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) took the top position in the market for the first time in over a decade. The company held 23% of the global smartphone shipment market by shipping approximately 74.0 million phones in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Moreover, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) global smartphone shipments grew by 3.7% from 2022 to 2023 against a drop of 13.6% for Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) during the same year. However, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could not secure the top position as the company's market share went down drastically to 17.3% in the first quarter of 2024. According to a report by The Guardian, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) global shipment of iPhones went down from 55.4 million to 50.1 million during the first quarter of 2024. This steep drop in sales of iPhones has been the biggest ever since COVID-19 and is mainly due to the Chinese government's ban on foreign devices. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a leading player in the global smartphone market.

It is expected that the language model would be able to understand the display on the screen regardless of the app and interact based on the open-ended instructions and prompts from the user. The AI technology is anticipated to pick icons, find text, describe text on the display, and parse widgets.\n\nOn February 26, Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF) announced becoming part of the AI-RAN alliance as a founding member to lead innovation in artificial intelligence and 6G technology. AI-RAN is an alliance is a joint venture of 11 companies, including Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd (OTC:SSNLF), Arm, ERIC - Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop innovative technologies.\n\nXiaomi Corporation (HKG:1810) is a consumer electronic and smart technology manufacturing company based in Hong Kong, China.

        "title": "11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nAmid rising inflation and economic uncertainty, millions of young Americans are starting to invest in different asset classes to secure their future and achieve their financial goals. As of the end of 2022, a whopping 58% of US households reported owning stocks, according to the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances. Increasing household wealth and the rise of zero-commission apps like Robinhood is partially responsible for this boom in retail investing.\n\nHas there been any change in retail investing trends ever since the Fed started raising interest rates? Money-market funds, bonds, treasuries and fixed income in general became much more tempting for investors who wanted to avoid volatility that comes with stock investing. In August last year, The Wall Street Journal, citing data from Refinitiv Lipper, said in a report that in matter of just five weeks, investors pulled $11.6 billion from stock funds on a net basis, while money-market funds saw an inflow of $91.1 billion.\n\nYoung Americans are Investing in Stocks and Pre-IPO Growth Companies\n\nAnalysts also note that young Americans are increasingly getting bored of the same-old names when it comes to stocks and want to invest in companies that will grow big in the future. They want to invest in the Apples, Microsofts and Nvidias of the future. And there are interesting options available for such investors. The Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) fund, which recently went public, lets you invest in high-growth companies that aren’t publicly traded. Some top names in the fund's portfolio are OpenAI, SpaceX, commercial space station company Axiom Space, Discord, Klarna, among many others. Other platforms allowing investors to invest in high-growth companies are also seeing a huge influx of young investors. For example, an April 16 Bloomberg report talked about Hiive, a platform that allows you to invest in pre-IPO, VC-backed companies. The report quoted Hiive's CEO Sim Desai, who said that the number of daily accepted bids has averaged 16 in the past 30 days, up from just three bids a year ago.\n\nRobinhood's Popularity is Increasing\n\nRobinhood is one of the popular platforms for retail investors, with over 10 million monthly active users. It's no longer an investing app where young investors band together to wage wars against short-selling hedge funds. Instead the company is in an expansion mode with new products for crypto investors as well as credit and gold cards. Last month, Bernstein started covering Robinhood stock with an Outperform rating, saying a \"monster\" crypto cycle over the next two years could boost the stock as more and more retail investors turn to the app to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024\n\nPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash\n\nTeenagers Using Apps to Invest\n\nBeyond millennial Redditors, there's another class of retail investors entering the market: teenagers. Investing-related TikTok videos, personal finance blogs, Instagram influencers and an overall rise in financial awareness is causing teenagers in America to invest. In 2022, there were about 200,000 custodial accounts for teens at Schwab, compared to just 120,000 in 2019. That figure jumped to 300,000 in 2023.\n\nDon’t Miss: Best Long-Term Investments for Your Child\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used publicly available data from Robinhood that shows the most popular stocks on the investing app. We also did some manual research to see which stocks are trending on the app these days with positive sentiment. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with these stocks where available. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).  Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) is a new arrival in the list of popular stocks on Robinhood. The stock plummeted after Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) revealed plans to sell more shares in the coming months. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) filed to register 146.11 million shares of common stock for holders, 21.49 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, and 4.06 million warrants to purchase common stock. DJT is rebounding after these dips and the stock is up a whopping 23% over the past five days.\n\n10. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) remains one of the favorites of retail investors who scored huge wins against hedge funds shorting the stock back in the pandemic days. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares have lost about 39% so far this year. Short sellers are targeting the stock again, with GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) short interest coming in at 24% as of April 16. Are retail investors banding together yet again to beat these short sellers? Only time will tell. But for now, the stock is declining after disappointing Q4 results which saw GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) hardware sales tanking.\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:40\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 hedge funds had stakes in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The most significant stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which had a $721 million stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F).\n\nIn addition to Ford, retail investors are also buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),   Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n8.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla’s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company’s full self-driving capabilities.”\n\n7. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024. The stock has gained about 24% so far this year.

These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”\n\n6. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are struggling this year as the company continues to face growth challenges amid competition. In a latest blow, data shows that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lost its market leader status in the smartphone industry to Samsung. Data from IDC shows that iPhone shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter of 2024. Samsung’s market share jumped to 20.8% as of the end of the first quarter, while Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to 17.3%. IDC said rising competition in China from companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, among others, is part of the reason why Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Never before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals—Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Dividend Stocks with Over 9% Yield According to Analysts 10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Apple said it had removed Meta’s WhatsApp messaging app and its Threads social media app from the App Store in China to comply with orders from Chinese authorities.\n\nThe apps were removed from the store on Friday after Chinese officials cited unspecified national security concerns.\n\nTheir removal comes amid elevated tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, technology and national security.\n\nThe U.S. has threatened to ban TikTok over national security concerns. But while TikTok, owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, is used by millions in the U.S., apps like WhatsApp and Threads are not commonly used in China.\n\nInstead, the messaging app WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, reigns supreme.\n\nOther Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download, although use of such foreign apps is blocked in China due to its “Great Firewall” network of filters that restrict use of foreign websites such as Google and Facebook.\n\n“The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in a statement.\n\n“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” Apple said.\n\nMeta did not immediately comment.\n\nApple, previously the world’s top smartphone maker, recently lost the top spot to Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The U.S. firm has run into headwinds in China, one of its top three markets, with sales slumping after Chinese government agencies and employees of state-owned companies were ordered not to bring Apple devices to work.\n\nApple has been diversifying its manufacturing bases outside China.\n\nIts CEO Tim Cook has been visiting Southeast Asia this week, traveling to Hanoi and Jakarta before wrapping up his travels in Singapore. On Friday he met with Singapore’s deputy prime minister, Lawrence Wong, where they “discussed the partnership between Singapore and Apple, and Apple’s continued commitment to doing business in Singapore.”\n\nApple pledged to invest over $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state.\n\nEarlier this week, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, pledging to increase spending on Vietnamese suppliers.\n\nHe also met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Cook later told reporters that they talked about Widodo's desire to promote manufacturing in Indonesia, and said that this was something that Apple would “look at\".\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Inflation-Proof Your Portfolio: 3 Overvalued Stocks to Dump Now",
        "content": "Sometimes, the trading price of a stock may seem too good to be true. That’s often because it is. Company valuations are a tricky business, they are often tied to a complex combination of financial performance and public perception. This can result in some companies listing as being worth more than their true intrinsic value on the stock market.\n\nIn times of inflation, the ultimate method of retaining wealth is holding appreciating assets instead of cash. As the value of cash depreciates, and buying power lessens, holding stocks that are overvalued could hurt long-term portfolio growth, as price corrections are inevitable.\n\nFurthermore, the market continues to look more and more like the bears are coming out, investors may want to consider which stocks are promising more than they can deliver. Thus, here are three of the most overvalued stocks to sell, should the market take a turn for the worse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the revolutionary leader in electric vehicle technology, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has consistently struggled with overvaluation. For many years, the company has consistently delivered on expectations, despite offering a product with questionable demand. That’s because, even though the electric car sounds like a life-changing technology, most people simply cannot afford a Tesla.\n\nThus, the company offers a premium solution in search of a marginal problem. As global economic factors like inflation and supply chain scarcity have squeezed consumers, many have begun questioning the real value of owning an electric car. Moreover, questions regarding range reliability in cold weather and overall travel practicality have begun eroding demand, thus slowing Tesla sales.\n\nPair this with recent restructuring efforts by Elon Musk, which led to a 10% workforce reduction, and the writing may be on the wall for Tesla. Though the company is certainly not going anywhere, investors who entered overvalued positions on the stock may want to consider a sale until the price corrects some more.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen was the last time Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) delivered an exceptional product? The company dominates neither the gaming sector or the creative sector, and its enterprise laptops are lackluster. Competitors from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to ASUS (TPE:2357) have consistently provided better, more complete machines than Dell.\n\nWhy is it, then, that the company’s stock price has soared nearly 170% in the last year? A major contributing factor has been the company’s savvy partnerships with AI companies to provide server solutions. This, however, could genuinely be a product of hype, as the firm’s bottom line may not see the long-term growth in server sales necessary to maintain such an inflated share price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the company’s AI servers essentially offer packaged, inflexible iterations of NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center Graphics Processing Units. Considering the cost of these GPUs, it’s likely that Dell’s margins are much thinner than the sales numbers might lead us to believe.\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the clouds\n\nSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech companies aren’t the only stocks at risk of overvaluation. Take, for example, airline companies like Southwest Airlines, (NYSE:LUV) which occupies an awkward operational niche. Somewhere between a major international airline and a domestic regional one, Southwest Airlines’ cost of revenue holds back its earning potential. The reason, however, has little to do with customers, and everything to do with aircraft choices.\n\nDue to its size and niche as a domestic airline, Southwest chose to operate Boeing 737s as its sole aircraft type. Considering the present scandals surrounding the aircraft, Southwest likely has some issues in its future. Furthermore, the airline focuses almost exclusively on profitable routes within the U.S. borders.\n\nWhile this helps mitigate revenue costs, it limits the airline’s growth and exposure to new customers. The combination of these two factors could make Southwest one of the overvalued stocks to sell, should market conditions worsen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "It used to be you had to have money to make money on Wall Street. And few people actually owned stocks. According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers, fewer than two families in 10 owned stocks as recently as 1962. However, 60 years later the same survey found as many as 58% of all families owned stocks.\n\nThere has been a great democratization of investing over those six decades. From the advent of the first discount broker Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) to deep discount traders like E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, the cost of making an investment has been going down. And Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) forced the industry to virtually give up transaction fees. Now you can buy and sell stocks at no cost!\n\nEssentially all the barriers previously erected to keep investing as the playground of the rich have been torn down. That means you can find stocks to buy with $100 and begin your journey to creating a comfortable retirement today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo if you only have a C-note to your name, and you don’t need that money to pay bills or for an emergency, then the following three stocks should be no-brainer stocks to buy this month.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) won’t intuitively seem a dead simple stock you should be buying with your $100. After all, shares trade for over $1,338 each. Even if you purchased fractional shares of AVGO stock, which is just a sliver of a whole share (it is totally possible and definitely worth doing), you’re not getting much for your money, right?\n\nWrong! You have to look at the quality of the company and not the price of a share. That’s why penny stocks are such a terrible idea. These are usually awful companies with little prospects for growth. But their cheap price makes them seem like such a deal. Unfortunately, you’re more likely to lose whatever money you put into them rather than make a killing. That is exactly why Broadcom is an excellent choice.\n\nThe chip stock for mobile communication companies has seen its fortunes grow with the proliferation of smartphones. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a major source of revenue, accounting for 20% of the total. But the mobile market has a boom-bust cyclicality to it and Broadcom wants to smooth out those peaks and valleys. It has more recently steered its efforts towards software, and following the acquisition of VMWare last November, the chipmaker expects half of its revenue to come from this segment.\n\nBroadcom stock also pays a dividend that has increased for 14 consecutive years. It has grown the payout at a 36% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 10 years. Because you will enjoy capital appreciation buying this stock as well as get paid for owning it, Broadcom is the first no-brainer stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee slinger Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the next stock you should be buying with your $100. At $86 a share it is trading close to its 52-week low of $84 a stub. It’s a great price for this excellent company.\n\nStarbucks stock is down in the dumps because of pressures on its international business. China is the company’s second-largest market with over 6,800 locations and the country’s slowing economy has weighed on performance. Similarly, its presence in the Middle East, though dramatically smaller in scope, is bearing the brunt of protests over the war between Israel and Palestinians. It also sees tougher competition here at home from Dunkin, Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nStill, Starbucks enjoys growing sales and profits. In its fiscal first quarter, revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion as comparable sales increased 5% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 20%. Analysts forecast the java shop will grow its profits at 15% annually for the next five years.\n\nSBUX stock also pays a dividend that yields 2.6% annually and it has been growing the payout at a rate of over 8% a year for 13 years. This is another no-brainer buy this month at this deeply discounted level.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last stock to buy without much thinking is Visa (NYSE:V), the No. 1 payments processor. It has some 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation and generated $14.5 trillion in total payments and cash volume for the full fiscal year. Visa also enjoys immense profitability.\n\nBecause the payments processor merely lends it brand to credit issuers, Visa’s gross profit margins are 98%. Operating margins are an impressive 57% while net margins are only slightly lower at 50%. It makes the company a cash-generating machine.\n\nVisa chooses to use a lot of that cash to return value to shareholders. Last October it announced it would be buying back $25 billion worth of stock, double the $12 billion it repurchased last year.\n\nThe payments company also pays a dividend that yields less than 1% annually. Yet it has been raising the payout at a torrid pace, hiking the dividend at almost 15% a year for the last five years. It just raised it 16% last year. Visa stock is a no-brainer stock to own now and for a lifetime.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It may be time to give the metaverse a second chance. Many investors are understandably somewhat skeptical of which metaverse stocks to buy following their uneven debut.\n\nThe theme had a ton of excitement and traction back 2021. So much so, in fact, that Mark Zuckerberg renamed his company from Facebook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to reflect what he felt might be the next big growth avenue in the tech landscape. So far that hasn’t played out, or at least not on the timeline that metaverse optimists may have been hoping for.\n\nBut the concept of an online meeting space where people can work, collaborate, socialize, and play games together remains compelling. And with technology rapidly advancing, there are better and better things that tech companies can achieve within an augmented or virtual reality setting. As a catalyst for the metaverse, earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released its Apple Vision Pro, which could greatly expand the marketplace and adoption of augmented and virtual reality solutions. That makes it a great time to look at these three leading metaverse stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is one of the two primary graphics engines that video game developers use to produce their games.\n\nUnity’s biggest appeal is its interoperability. A developer can build a game in Unity and quickly release it across console, PC, smartphone, and augmented and virtual reality. In fact, reports suggested that Mark Zuckerberg considered acquiring Unity to make it a core part of the Oculus ecosystem.\n\nHowever, Unity has remained independent and can offer its graphic solutions to the entire gamut of game and app developers. Of note, Unity is one of the key partners in developing apps and experiences for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nUnity shares have underperformed much of the tech market, as the company is still experimenting with monetization and there are also questions around its advertising-driven revenue streams. However, in the longer-term, Unity has a great graphics engine. If it can solve commercialization issues, Unity should be set for significant upside with the metaverse being an intriguing piece of its broader story.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is a property technology company. Its core business model is to have clients take high-quality imagery of their properties. Matterport can use this imagery to create detailed 3-D renderings of a property and allow the owner to host virtual walk-throughs and site visits.\n\nStory continues\n\nA wedding venue, for example, could offer virtual tours to help potential customers see and experience what their venue would be like without having to go there in person first.\n\nAs technology such as the Apple Vision Pro gains adoption, it will be easier and easier for customers to take part in the digital tour and walk-throughs. Clients such as hotels, resorts, and office buildings will increasingly embrace Matterport as folks become more accustomed to digital property tours.\n\nMatterport has gotten off to a slow start as a publicly traded company. The former SPAC has seen shares lose the majority of their value; however, the firm’s revenues continue to grow. Analysts see the company generating about $176 million in sales this year, which would be up 11% from last year. And further, analysts expect the company to reach profitability on an earnings per share basis in 2026.\n\nMatterport has overcome a rocky transition from a hardware and licensing model towards recurring subscription revenue. As investors gain confidence in its business direction, and people continue to adopt and augmented reality solutions, MTTR stock should be set for a comeback.\n\nTencent Holdings (TCEHY)\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a large Chinese technology and media conglomerate. It both operates its own business and maintains investment stakes in a vast array of companies.\n\nTencent Holdings shares have plunged in recent years due to China’s decline in consumer spending and economic slump. However, Tencent should be ripe for a rebound as it has numerous ways to profit from China’s economic recovery.\n\nAs it pertains to the metaverse, Tencent is a leading video gaming company. It has its own media operations, and it also invests in other leading video game developers. Its large holding in Epic Games gives it a particular leg up in the metaverse space.\n\nThat’s because Epic runs Fortnite, which is arguably the most successful metaverse property to date. Fortnite has gained incredible mind share with younger players which has allowed it to attract large international brands who have set up digital stores in the Fortnite universe. Additionally, Fortnite hosts concerts and media events which attract players for unique experiences and allow all sorts of branding, product sales, and other monetization opportunities.\n\nTencent was ahead of the curve in taking a large ownership position in Epic and other gaming properties. It should be poised to profit from the metaverse, regardless of which particular games, experiences, and brands end up attracting the most metaverse users over time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U stock.

        "title": "Apple Just Posted Its Largest Single-Session Pop in Over 11 Months After Artificial Intelligence (AI) Update. Is the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Returning to Growth?",
        "content": "On April 11, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock popped 4.3% in a single session, the largest jump in nearly a year. However, the stock gave back some of those gains in the following sessions due to a broader market pullback and reports of lower iPhone shipments.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's moving Apple stock, where the investment thesis stands, and whether the stock is worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI absence\n\nApple has been noticeably absent from the broader tech stock, growth stock, and artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled market rally. In fact, Apple stock lost value in 2024 and has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year.\n\nThere are plenty of valid reasons for Apple's underperformance. The primary issue is that Apple's earnings have stalled and growth has ground to a halt. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company has failed to make a splash in AI, while other big tech companies have been able to measure AI's impact on their bottom lines and chart a multiyear runaway toward further AI-fueled growth. Apple's AI and virtual reality investments, like the Vision Pro, are still in their early stages and haven't had a material impact on the company's performance just yet.\n\nHowever, investors got a much-needed vote of confidence on April 11 when reports surfaced that Apple was nearing the production of computer processors with AI capabilities.\n\nAI chips have been a major catalyst for semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices and could help rejuvenate interest in consumer electronics. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled forward demand for Apple's products, which boosted short-term results but led to sluggish growth in recent years. Apple needs a defining product characteristic for the next upgrade cycle since marginal product improvements haven't been enough to spur demand meaningfully. Embedding more AI capabilities into the iPhone would be the natural way to help Apple return to growth.\n\nNear-term challenges are heating up\n\nAs for now, Apple remains stuck in a demand slump. International Data Group (IDC) reported that Apple's iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the first quarter of 2024. Apple has so far been able to offset slower demand out of China with rising or flat demand in North America and emerging markets.\n\nInvestors will have to wait until May 2 to hear from Apple about its exact second-quarter fiscal 2024 figures. However, the IDC report is concerning and illustrates the importance of Apple's product improvements. Apple must convince investors that next-generation products will sell because they are better, not just because consumers are due for an upgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference from June 10 to June 14 and its annual new product unveiling event in September are the two marquee events this year. These events are good opportunities for Apple to flex its innovation. But if Apple disappoints, they could also accelerate downward pressure on the stock.\n\nThink long-term with Apple\n\nApple stock has been noticeably more volatile lately. In late March, the stock suffered its largest single-session drop in over seven months, followed by its largest single-session gain in over 11 months just a few weeks later. Apple's brand and market positioning need no introduction, but its growth is in question, especially as consumers remain strained.\n\nWith the growth narrative out the window, at least for now, Apple is starting to look more like a value stock. It is the cheapest \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in terms of price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. It even trades at a discount to the S&P 500.\n\nApple isn't dirt cheap, but it doesn't fetch nearly the premium as its behemoth tech peers. Investors who are confident Apple can turn things around are getting the chance to buy the stock for a good price. However, it's important to understand that Apple has fallen for mostly good reasons and that it could fall further with a broader market sell-off.\n\nBuying Apple now shouldn't be a bet on the stock suddenly staging an epic turnaround, but rather a long-term investment in an excellent company that will monetize AI and has a long runway for returning value to shareholders and growing over time.\n\nIt's worth noting that even amid slowing growth, Apple generates plenty of extra cash to continue to buy back a boatload of stock and raise its dividend. Apple is a buy for patient investors, but the stock could face pressure if its AI investments fail to deliver.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Battered Blue-Chip Stocks to Bounce From Your Portfolio This Spring",
        "content": "If your blue-chip stocks are underperforming, you have a big problem. Blue-chip stocks represent the best, most stable companies and can usually be considered solid performers. There are plenty of good names out there, so there’s no need to holding battered blue-chip stocks.\n\nEven with some recent pullbacks, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite are up 5% on the year. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is comprised of 30 of the most prominent companies, is faltering. Its gains for the year are negligible at best.\n\nBlue-chip stocks represent established companies that are leaders in their field. They often pay reliable dividends and are considered safe for long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut you aren’t getting those generous returns from the blue-chip stocks on this list. For various reasons, these battered blue-chip stocks are taking it on the chin right now, and threatening to pull portfolios down with them.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader is an ideal tool for identifying blue-chip stocks that aren’t making the grade. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum, and assigns an “A” through “F” grade accordingly.\n\nThese blue-chip names are among the worst to have now. Act accordingly if you’re holding any of these equities.\n\nApple (AAPL) A close-up shot of the Apple Pay page\n\nSource: Bloomicon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the biggest company in the world by market capitalization. It was revered for innovative products, had a huge base of customers and was seemingly unlimited potential.\n\nWhat in the heck happened to push AAPL to the ranks of battered blue-chip stocks?\n\nBut the shine on this Apple faded a bit last year, as iPhone sales slipped and earnings flattened. Apple saw drops in multiple products, including to Macs, home products, iPads and wearable technology.\n\nIt doesn’t help that Apple is facing huge challenges in China, where iPhone sales are down 24% in the first few weeks of the year, in part because competitor Huawei is now offering its own 5G smartphone.\n\nApple is also battling both the U.K. and U.S. on the legal front, with allegations that Apple’s App Store unfairly stymies competition.\n\nApple is still a great company. But as an investment, it’s best to leave it on the tree. AAPL stock is down 13% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TLSA) was on a dynamic run at the beginning of the decade, rising over 1,000% in a two-year span from January 2020 to December 2021. Since then? A huge disappointment.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are a couple of factors at play. First, Tesla dominated the EV market in that two-year period, but naturally, other car manufacturers began entering the market and giving Tesla competition. Tesla responded by lowering the prices on some of its models to spur sales, and in turn cutting its own profit margin.\n\nThe second issue is Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk. Tesla’s slip in stock price corresponds to his $44 billion purchase of the social media platform Twitter, which he rebranded to X. Musk sold billions of dollars in Tesla stock to finance the deal.\n\nAn activist at heart, Musk eagerly uses X as a platform to espouse controversial views and stir the pot. The drama makes Tesla a less appealing brand to would-be customers who don’t want to be seen as endorsing Musk’s brand of politics.\n\nTesla will report its first-quarter earnings on April 23 and analysts are already bracing for bad news. TSLA stock is down 37% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor chip maker Intel (NYSE:INTC) is facing some challenges. While its stock flails in 2024, bigger and better-heeled competitors are soaring on the power of generative AI chips, and in turn helping investors in those companies make money hand over fist.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that tech stock investors are turning away from Intel.\n\nThe company’s foundry division posted a loss of $7 billion in 2023 as it attempts to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor (NASDAQ:TSM), which already has the lion’s share of the foundry market.\n\nIntel is still investing in the business, pouring billions of dollars into increasing capacity. It currently has a 1% market share in the foundry business, but hopes to be No. 2 in the world and start turning a profit by 2030 (TSMC has the top spot locked up with a 58% market share).\n\nI don’t know about you, but that’s a long time to ask investors to wait for foundry profits. INTC stock is down 29% this year and gets a “C” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a fintech stock that may have ahead of its time. The stock rose 170% from January 2020 to July 2021, the Covid-19 shutdown era in which e-commerce was pretty much the only way to buy and sell products.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that PayPal stock once topped $300. Now it could be had for less than $70. And while the company offers an impressive array of brands, including Zettle, Xoom, Venmo, Honey and Hyperwallet, there’s massive competition in the fintech space.\n\nThe number of active users fell from 435 million in 2022 to 431 million in 2023. If PayPal is going to turn around its slide, it will need to find a way to reverse that trend.\n\nPYPL stock is up 3% so far in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford logo badge on grill of car\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Co. (NYSE:F) is one of the best-known brands in the world. As an automaker, Ford makes the F-150 pickup, the Explorer SUV and the sporty Mustang. It’s one of the Big Three Detroit automakers.\n\nIt’s been a challenge in recent months, however. Competition is always fierce, and Tesla’s move to lower its EV prices has a ripple effect for other automakers that Ford can’t ignore.\n\nFord also was one of three automakers that experienced a strike last year, and was forced to make significant wage concessions to get union members back on the job.\n\nFord saw an 81% jump in its EV sales in February, and overall sales increase by 6.8% in the first quarter. It remains to be seen how the company’s profit margins will hold, however, and how investors will react when it reports first-quarter earnings on April 24.\n\nF stock is down 1% in 2024 and gets a “D” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBoeing (BA) Image of Boeing (BA) airplane in a hanger.\n\nSource: Alex JW Robinson / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is a nightmare stock to own right now. The aerospace and defense contractor is under serious pressure as a series of problems with its aircraft left investors reeling.\n\nFirst, a rear door plug flew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet in mid-flight. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded Boeing 737 Max 9 jets for inspection, and two airlines reported finding loose screws on their aircraft.\n\nThe FAA allowed the Max 9 to resume flying a few weeks later, but many passengers remain reluctant. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board both issued critical reports of Boeing as well.\n\nSo unsurprisingly, Boeing stock is one of the worst performers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024, down 34%.\n\nIt’s going to be a rough period for Boeing in 2024 and there’s no need to try to catch a falling knife. BA stock has an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) grew mightily from its roots in Seattle to be a dominant brand around the world. Starbucks has more than 39,000 locations, with plans to increase that to 55,000 by the end of the decade.\n\nHowever, the stock is trading near its 52-week lows as customer traffic fell in the U.S. and China. Embattled Luckin Coffee (OTCMTKS:LKNCY) surpassed Starbucks as China’s No. 1 coffeehouse with an aggressive expansion and pricing plan that undercuts Starbucks.\n\nStarbucks saw its international store count and international revenue grow by 10% in 2023 – but operating margins slipped, and the company’s operating income remained flat for the year despite the expansion.\n\nThe company will need to find a way to turn its fortunes in China around without shaving off too much in margin and profitability. SBUX stock is down 10% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.The InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held AAPL, but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

The world's second-largest economy is one of Apple's most important overseas markets, and a massive manufacturing hub. \"There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a trip to China in March. But with China sales slumping and possible threats to its supply chain, Apple could be taking a closer look at new Asian markets.\n\nApple's CEO just wrapped up a five-day tour of Southeast Asia, stopping by Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore in a trip that could be an effort by the company to \"hedge its supply chain bets\" and \"ease the path\" for later investment in the fast-growing region.\n\nSoutheast Asia is one of several emerging markets, alongside India and Latin America, that Apple needs to target for future growth, says Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\n“Apple’s brand image is perceived as high-end in the Southeast Asian region and holds a favorable position in consumers’ mindsets,” he says. The analyst anticipates “further enhancement” in Apple’s sales strategies for Southeast Asia as the region’s consumption levels improve.\n\nSoutheast Asia, for now, makes up a small, but fast-growing, percentage of the iPhone market.\n\n“Apple shipped just under 10 million iPhones per year to Southeast Asia last year, which accounted for less than 5% of global iPhone shipments. But that was still 32% growth for iPhones in Southeast Asia,” Bryan Ma, vice president of client devices research at IDC, says.\n\nBut Ma suspects that Cook’s interest in Southeast Asia is driven not by retail, but manufacturing.\n\n“I suspect that an even bigger motivation behind the visit though is for the company to hedge its supply chain bets as the industry continues to diversify from China. That means not just meetings with suppliers who have operations in the region, but also with governments who can ease the path for investments in their countries later,” Ma said.\n\nChina is still Apple's largest manufacturing hub, but the COVID pandemic demonstrated to the iPhone maker the risk of having everything in one place. COVID lockdowns in Zhengzhou, sometimes known as \"iPhone City,\" lowered Apple's smartphone production in 2022. Apple later partly blamed COVID disruptions for a 5% year-on-year drop in revenue for the 2022 holiday quarter.\n\nMore broadly, the U.S. is encouraging companies to \"de-risk\" by diversifying supply chains away from China.\n\nWhere did Apple CEO Tim Cook visit in Southeast Asia?\n\nCook’s first stop was Vietnam, already part of Apple’s supply chain. The country boasts a typical export-oriented manufacturing economy, and can leverage its close proximity to existing manufacturing supply chains in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring his two-day stay in Vietnam, Cook pledged to increase spending on Vietnam-based suppliers during a meeting with Pham Minh Chinh, the country’s prime minister, in Hanoi. The company says it’s already spent close to $16 billion on the country’s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.\n\nCook then traveled to Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and most populous country. During a meeting with the country’s outgoing president, Joko Widodo, Cook said he would consider setting up manufacturing facilities in the country.\n\nApple currently has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia. Instead, the company has set up several app developer academics since 2018. Apple said it would open its fourth developer academy in Bali during Cook's visit.\n\nIndonesia requires smartphones sold in the country to be made up of at least 35% local components by volume, though Apple satisfies the requirement, despite the lack of local production, through its developer academies.\n\nThe government hopes the U.S. tech giant will go beyond software. Indonesia’s industry minister, who was also at the meeting with Cook and Widodo, suggested after the meeting that Apple could partner with Indonesian companies to obtain components, even if it does not set up a manufacturing facility.\n\nCook’s final stop on his Southeast Asian tour was Singapore, the city-state with the region’s highest per capita income. The country is home to three of Apple’s five Southeast Asian stores. (The other two are in Thailand, and Apple is reportedly considering its first store in Malaysia)\n\nUpon Cook's arrival, Apple announced that it would invest over $250 million to grow its campus in the city-state. Apple opened its first facility in 1981, with 72 employees focused on the Apple II personal computer. The company says it now uses Singapore as a regional hub for critical roles and currently employs over 3,600 staff.\n\nApple's CEO met Singapore's prime minister-to-be, Lawrence Wong, on Friday. On LinkedIn, Wong wrote that he discussed \"opportunities in Southeast Asia\" and \"the close partnership between Singapore and Apple\" in his meeting with Cook.\n\nOn a popular Singaporean radio show on Friday, Cook said he wanted to invest more in R&D in the country. “Singapore has always held a special place in my heart,” he told listeners.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Xi Jinping's diktat comes as US politicians consider their own crackdown on TikTok - REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo\n\nChina has ordered Apple to block WhatsApp and Threads in the country amid a fresh crackdown on dissent by leader Xi Jinping.\n\nOfficials from China’s Cyberspace Administration told Apple to remove the messaging services from its domestic App Store based on “national security concerns,” a spokesman for the company said.\n\nThe apps were already largely inaccessible from within China, which operates a so-called Great Firewall to lock out thousands of websites and services offering global news and the opportunity to exercise free speech.\n\nHowever, tech-savvy consumers have been able to bypass these blocks with software that hides their location. The new crackdown will add further friction to accessing the apps, developed by Facebook owner Meta, in the first place, and make it difficult to update them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nApple was also ordered to block private messaging apps Signal, Telegram and Line as part of China’s demands.\n\nThe diktat comes as US politicians consider their own crackdown on TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-headquartered Bytedance.\n\nUS politicians are debating a law that would force Bytedance to sell the app within six months, or see it blocked from US smartphone app stores.\n\nApple has previously been forced to ban other apps in China, including a block on the New York Times.\n\nApple said: “We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree.\n\n“The cyberspace administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns.

        "title": "68% of Warren Buffett's $372 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 4 Stocks",
        "content": "Wall Street is a bona fide long-term wealth creator, and few money managers know this better than Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking the reins at Berkshire nearly six decades ago, the appropriately named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a 4,913,549% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) and practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nWarren Buffett's \"recipe\" for success is no secret. On numerous occasions he's been more than willing to share the characteristics/traits he looks for in the businesses he invests in. You'll often find the Oracle of Omaha and his closest investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, adding brand-name, time-tested companies to Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBut something else worth noting is just how important portfolio concentration has been to Berkshire Hathaway's long-term success. The company's top investment minds, which until his recent passing included the great Charlie Munger, have long believed that added weighting should be given to their best ideas.\n\nAs of the closing bell on April 12, 2024, 68% ($253.2 billion) of the $372 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in just four stocks.\n\nApple: $159,876,617,000 in market value (42.9% of invested assets)\n\nIf there was any doubt that Buffett and his team prefer to bet big on their top investment ideas, look no further than tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Despite Berkshire Hathway having stakes in 45 stocks and two index funds, nearly 43% of invested assets are tied up in Apple.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's love for Apple was professed during Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting last May, where Buffett commented that Apple is \"a better businesses than any we own.\" It's a particularly strong statement given that his company outright owns insurer GEICO and railroad BNSF, among roughly five dozen other businesses.\n\nOne factor that helps check all the right boxes for Apple is its top-notch management team. CEO Tim Cook is currently leading Apple's transformation to a platform-driven operating model. Although the company isn't turning its back on the physical products that endeared it to consumers (iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), it's simply evolving to focus its efforts on subscription services.\n\nA subscription-driven platform should help Apple lift its operating margin over time, as well as smooth out sales fluctuations typically observed during major iPhone upgrade cycles. Further, subscriptions should enhance Apple's already impressive customer loyalty and keep consumers within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Warren Buffett's favorite thing about Apple might just be its unsurpassed capital-return program. Apple is doling out $14.8 billion in annual dividends to its shareholders and has repurchased $651 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. These buybacks have steadily increased Berkshire's ownership stake in the company.\n\nBank of America: $36,695,773,295 in market value (9.9% of invested assets)\n\nThough Apple accounts for the lion's share of Berkshire Hathaway's invested assets, there's no sector Buffett has historically piled into more than financials. Money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) accounts for almost 10% of Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio.\n\nWhat makes bank stocks so attractive to the Oracle of Omaha is their ability to take advantage of long-winded periods of growth. The U.S. economy spends a disproportionate length of time expanding, relative to contracting, which allows money-center banks like BofA to grow their loan portfolios over time and generate more interest income.\n\nBut Bank of America has more going for it than just the steady long-term growth of the U.S. economy. For starters, it's the most interest-sensitive among America's biggest banks. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates at the fastest pace in four decades. In turn, BofA has seen its net-interest income increase by billions of dollars each quarter.\n\nWhat's been even more impressive is BofA's efforts to encourage digital banking. Since the end of 2020, consumer household adoption of digital banking has risen six percentage points to 75%, with nearly half of all loan sales being completed online or via mobile app during the December-ended quarter. As consumers shift their banking habits to digital platforms, Bank of America has the luxury of consolidating some of its physical branches and lowering its expenses.\n\nThe cherry on the sundae for Warren Buffett is that Berkshire's BofA stake is generating close to $992 million in annual dividend income. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $33,081,454,740 in market value (8.9% of invested assets)\n\nDid I mention that financial stocks are something of a go-to for the Oracle of Omaha? Credit-services kingpin American Express(NYSE: AXP) has been a continuous holding in Berkshire's portfolio for 33 years (and counting) and accounts for just shy of 9% of invested assets.\n\nLike Bank of America, AmEx benefits from extended periods of growth. Whereas no U.S. recession has surpassed the 18-month mark since the end of World War II, there have been two periods of expansion that surpassed 10 years. These lengthy cycles of growth spur consumers and businesses to spend, which is great news for AmEx.\n\nThe company-specific reason American Express has outperformed for so long is its willingness to play both sides of the transaction aisle. On one hand, it's the No. 3 payment processor in the U.S. (the world's largest market for consumption) by credit card network purchase volume. If the U.S. and global economy are booming, it'll generate plenty of fees from merchants.\n\nOn the other hand, it also acts as a lender. The company's cardholders may pay annual fees and interest to American Express. Though being a lender can expose AmEx to credit delinquencies and potential loan losses during economic downturns, being able to double dip during lengthy periods of growth makes this dual approach worthwhile.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that American Express has an uncanny ability to attract high earners. Well-to-do cardholders are less likely to alter their spending habits or fail to pay their bills when the rate of inflation picks up or a minor recession occurs. In theory, AmEx is better prepared for economic downturns than most lending institutions.\n\nCoca-Cola: $23,312,000,000 in market value (6.3% of invested assets)\n\nThe fourth top holding in Berkshire Hathaway's $372 billion portfolio is none other than Warren Buffett's longest-held stock, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Shares of Coca-Cola have been continuously held by the Oracle of Omaha's company since 1988.\n\nIf you want proof that time is an undeniable ally for investors, Coca-Cola is a bubbling example. Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis in this beverage behemoth is about $3.2475 per share. But thanks to Coke's 62 consecutive years of base annual dividend increases, it's now parsing out $1.94 per share each year to its shareholders. Berkshire's investment team is overseeing a 60% annual yield relative to their company's cost basis in Coca-Cola!\n\nCoca-Cola's lengthy track record of success can be boiled down to three factors. First, it's a consumer staples stock. It provides a basic necessity good (beverages) that consumers are going to purchase regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. or global economy are performing. This has led to highly predictable operating cash flow year after year.\n\nSecondly, Coca-Cola's geographic diversity is practically unmatched. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (due to its invasion of Ukraine), Coke has ongoing operations in every other country. It's able to move the organic growth needle thanks to its presence in emerging markets, but is bringing in predicable cash flow in developed countries.\n\nThe third catalyst has been its top-notch marketing efforts. It's shifted a substantial portion of its advertising budget to digital channels to reach a younger audience. However, Coca-Cola has a storied history it can lean on to connect with its mature consumers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Over $10 Billion Invested in 7 Stocks. Here's the Best Stock to Buy Right Now, According to Wall Street.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. He quickly shifted its focus from textiles to insurance, creating consistent cash flow in the form of insurance premiums, and he has invested that capital to great effect over the years. Berkshire stock has returned 19.8% annually under Buffett's leadership, nearly doubling the return of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nToday, Berkshire is worth $850 billion, and a significant portion of that sum is attributable to its $361 billion stock portfolio. Buffett reportedly manages 90% of that total, while fellow investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler oversee the remaining portion. Berkshire does not disclose which managers are responsible for specific investments, but it seems likely that Buffett controls the largest positions.\n\nWith that in mind, Berkshire has more than $10 billion invested in the seven stocks listed alphabetically below. Beside each stock is Wall Street's median price target and the implied upside compared to its share price on April 16, 2024.\n\nAmerican Express(NYSE: AXP): $234 per share (7.2% upside). Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $200 per share (18.1% upside). Bank of America(NYSE: BAC): $39 per share (12.5% upside). Chevron(NYSE: CVX): $180 per share (15.2% upside). Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO): $66.50 per share (14.5% upside). Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC): $39.50 per share (7.9% upside). Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY): $70 per share (4.8% upside).\n\nWall Street sees upside in all seven stocks listed above, but the median price targets position Apple as the best best right now. That is noteworthy because Apple is by far Berkshire's largest holding. It accounts for 42% of its portfolio, a clear sign that Buffett has great confidence in the consumer electronics company.\n\nIs Apple stock a worthwhile investment right now?\n\nApple reported mixed results in the December quarter\n\nApple reported first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, but the performance itself was mixed. Total revenue increased just 2% to $119.5 billion on modest sales growth in the iPhone and services categories, offset by declines in the iPad and wearables categories.\n\nMeanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 16% to $2.18 per diluted share due to disciplined cost management, stock buybacks, and a revenue mix shift toward high-margin services. The chart below provides more detail on first-quarter revenue growth across each product category. The chart above shows Apple's revenue across individual product categories in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nLooking ahead, the investment thesis for Apple centers on its ability to not only maintain its strong presence in several consumer electronics verticals, especially smartphones, but also to monetize its installed base with adjacent services. When I say services, I am referring to revenue from iCloud storage, App Store fees, advertising, subscription products like Apple TV+, and financial products like Apple Pay.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo elaborate, Apple has an installed base that exceeds 2.2 billion devices, a testament to its brand authority. That should keep the company at the forefront of consumer electronics. However, consumers purchase devices infrequently and hardware earns lower margins than software and services. As such, Apple has a more sustainable and profitable growth opportunity in its services business.\n\nApple is beset by challenges in China and Europe\n\nApple is facing tough competition from Chinese smartphone companies like Huawei and Xiaomi. iPhone shipments declined 9.6% in the March quarter, and Apple lost more than three points of market share, according to the International Data Corp (IDC). That is especially concerning because total smartphone shipments increased 7.8% during the quarter, with all market share gains going to Chinese competitors.\n\nApple is also facing headwinds from the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in Europe, recent legislation forcing the company to allow third-party app stores on its devices. Apple has historically had a strong presence in the mobile application market. Its App Store earned twice as much revenue as the closest competitor last year, and it accounted for 50% of mobile application spending. However, the DMA could weaken its grip on the market by letting developers bypass its transaction fees and distribute mobile applications through alternative platforms.\n\nThe DMA also poses another problem. Apple ranked among the fastest-growing advertising companies in the world last year, and search ads (in the App Store) were the largest source of advertising revenue. But the DMA could weaken Apple's grip on that market by making the App Store less consequential. In other words, developers will probably spread their advertising dollars across third-party platforms as they become popular with European consumers.\n\nApple stock looks expensive compared to Wall Street's earnings forecast\n\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to grow earnings per share at 10.2% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 26.3 times earnings look expensive, especially when headwinds across China and Europe could lead to slower-than-expected earnings growth.\n\nAs mentioned, Warren Buffett has 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio invested in Apple, which screams high conviction. However, I doubt Apple can outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years based on its current valuation. Personally, I would avoid this stock right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. said that it removed Meta Platforms Inc.’s WhatsApp and Threads from its China apps store after an order from the country’s internet regulator, which said the services pose risks to the country’s security.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Record Rainfall in Dubai?

The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in a statement. “These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”\n\nThe order comes on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores. In August, China asked all mobile app developers to register with the government by the end of March, a move that Beijing painted as a bid to counter telephone scams and fraud.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would carry out supervision work on those filings from April to June, and to take action against apps that were not registered. App developers would also be required to set up and improve mechanisms to handle “illegal information.”\n\nThe MIIT move was another step by Beijing to tighten controls across its cyberspace, forcing domestic and foreign companies to block off information considered politically sensitive. Beyond apps, websites and large language AI models have also been subject to greater content curbs.\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nChina is a key nation for the iPhone, its largest consumer market outside the US and its primary production base. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the country earlier this year and emphasized its importance to his business. Apple has long said that it needs to follow local laws as part of operating its app store effectively in different countries.\n\nForeign social media platforms like WhatsApp were already largely inaccessible from China without tools to circumvent Beijing’s Great Firewall, such as virtual private networks. The removal of these apps will make it more difficult for users within the country to view content on these international platforms.\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- SK Hynix Inc. will have to contend with high expectations when it reports next week after solid earnings from the likes of Micron Technology Inc. cemented optimism about demand for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nElon Wants His Money Back Dubai Grinds to Standstill as Flooding Hits City Record Rainfall in Dubai? Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud Seeding Singapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to Qatar Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs\n\nMicron’s surprisingly strong sales forecast last month spurred optimism about SK Hynix’s earnings outlook, Bloomberg Intelligence said. The South Korean company’s stock has rallied 16% since the US company’s results. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. also posted better-than-expected revenue guidance, with strong AI demand reviving growth at the world’s biggest contract chipmaker.\n\nLuxshare Precision Industry Co., which gets about three-quarters of revenue from Apple Inc., will be watched closely after iPhone sales slumped 9.6% in the first quarter. While full-year revenue growth is projected to have slowed to 10% from 39% the year before, BI said market share gains for iPhone-related orders may bring an upside surprise.\n\nJapan’s largest investment bank, Nomura Holdings Inc., probably returned to earnings growth in the year through March after three years of shrinking profit, supported by an equity market revival in Japan.\n\nHighlights to look out for:\n\nSaturday: HDFC Bank’s (HDFCB IN) efforts to shore up deposits amid a liquidity crunch proved fruitful and helped it keep up with demand for credit, largely from retail, commercial and rural loans, according to its pre-earnings update. Liquidity built up through stronger deposit mobilization may also weigh on near-term lending margins, Nomura analysts including Param Subramanian said. Quarterly profit probably grew 46%, despite the expected cyclical decline in margins.\n\nMonday: Reliance Industries (RELIANCE IN) should post 2.2% quarterly profit growth as weakness in its oil-to-chemicals business partly offset better performance at its telecom and retail ventures. The conglomerate is in talks with Tesla Inc. about building a manufacturing facility in India, according to a Hindu BusinessLine report.\n\nTuesday: Nidec (6594 JP) may meet its full-year sales and operating profit guidance, helped by industrial machinery and robot sales. The Japanese automotive components maker’s share price should be supported by a more stable earnings outlook, Jefferies analysts said. Demand for electronic auto parts in Japan may remain sluggish in the wake of Daihatsu’s emission certification scandals.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday: Luxshare Precision’s (002475 CH) annual adjusted profit is seen rising 21%, estimates show, boosted by order wins in the iPhone supply chain. The company’s deal to take control of an iPhone assembly site run by rival Pegatron, announced in December, will help it ramp up assembly of the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, Morningstar said in a note last month.\n\nPrada’s (1913 HK) first-quarter revenue is projected to rise 9.7%, led by the Japan and Asia-Pacific regions. The weak yen probably spurred local demand and tourist spending in Japan, said BI. The Miu Miu brand should continue to fare well thanks to its popularity among younger Chinese consumers, Jefferies added. Hindustan Unilever’s (HUVR IN) fourth-quarter revenue is expected to climb around 2.9%, consensus shows, although rural demand has been uneven and urban consumers grow pickier with newer players entering the market. India’s forecast of an above-normal monsoon should augur well for demand this fiscal year. The company is also mulling spinning off its ice cream business, according to the Economic Times.\n\nThursday: SK Hynix’s (000660 KS) operating profit will probably beat consensus thanks to its dominant market share in high bandwidth memory chips, BI said. The firm should be a beneficiary of enterprise clients increasingly shifting the data storage from hard disk drives to solid state drives for AI training purposes, Citi said.\n\nFriday: Nomura Holdings (8604 JP) full-year net income is seen jumping 80%, consensus estimates show, buoyed by optimism about Japanese equities after the Bank of Japan scrapped its negative interest rate. Japanese financial institutions should perform strongly in the domestic retail and wholesale businesses amid the favorable climate, Citi analysts said. Nomura is expected to be the next Japanese lender to issue dollar-denominated Additional Tier 1 bonds to diversify sources of capital, BI said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store Rents Are the Fed’s ‘Biggest Stumbling Block’ in Taming US Inflation Aging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand The Pentagon Wants to Give Defense Startups a Chance  For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Recasts and writes through)\n\nBy Josh Ye and Mrinmay Dey\n\nApril 19 (Reuters) - Apple said on Friday it had removed Meta Platforms' WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China after being ordered to do so by the Chinese government, which cited national security concerns.\n\nOther Meta apps including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available, according to Reuters checks on Friday morning. Many other popular apps developed by Western companies including YouTube and X were also available for download.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how WhatsApp or Threads might have caused security concerns for Chinese authorities.\n\n\"The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,\" Apple said in an emailed statement to Reuters.\n\n\"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,\" the statement said.\n\nMeta declined to comment and referred queries to Apple.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe iPhone maker said WhatsApp and Threads remain available for download on its other storefronts. Tech-savvy Chinese consumers are able to download the apps from Apple's App Stores in other countries if they have an iCloud account there.\n\nSome experts on China's tech industry said the government order on WhatsApp and Threads could be related to a new rule last August that requires all apps available in China to register with the government or risk being removed.\n\nThe deadline for companies to complete registrations was the end of March and the regulations came into effect on April 1.\n\nApple has removed apps from its China app store before.\n\nIn 2017, Apple removed The New York Times news app saying it violated local regulations - a move that came amid rising news censorship in the world's second-largest economy. It remains unavailable on Apple's China App Store.\n\nLast year, Apple pulled a number of ChatGPT-like apps when Beijing was working on local regulations on generative artificial intelligence(AI) services.\n\nThe removal of WhatsApp and Threads from the China App Store was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Ye in Hong Kong, Mrinmay Dey and Nilutpal Timsina in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Netflix (NFLX) will no longer report membership numbers starting next year — a bombshell move for the streaming industry, which has historically tied company performance to subscriber gains or losses.\n\n\"We've evolved and we're going to continue to evolve,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said about the decision while speaking during the company's first quarter earnings call on Thursday.\n\nAlong with subscribers, the company will also stop reporting a key profitability metric — average revenue per member, or ARM.\n\nPeters cited Netflix's shifting revenue model, which now includes its advertising tier and \"extra member\" fees, as a prime reason for the decision.\n\nThese \"are things that aren't directly connected to the number of members,\" he said.\n\nThe executive added the streamer has also \"evolved our pricing and plans with multiple tiers and different price points across different countries.\" Therefore, he said, \"each incremental member has a different business impact.\"\n\n\"All of that means, by the historical simple math that we all did, the number of members [multiplied by] the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,\" Peters said, although he did note the company will not \"be silent\" on subscribers either.\n\n\"We'll periodically update when we grow and we hit certain major milestones [but] it's just not going to be part of our regular reporting,\" he said.\n\nAlthough tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) do not reveal subscriber figures for their respective streaming services, other media companies do.\n\nDisney (DIS) separately breaks out Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ figures, while Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) reports a combined number for its Max and Discovery+ platform. Paramount Global (PARA) also reveals subscriber figures for its flagship platform Paramount+.\n\n\"The movement to no longer disclose quarterly subscriptions from next year will not go down well; more so given subs growth that the streaming king has seen over the last year,\" PP Foresight tech and media analyst Paolo Pescatore said in an email.\n\nCiti analyst Jason Bazinet added: \"We suspect reduced disclosures may disappoint the Street.\"\n\nIn its first quarter earnings report Thursday, Netflix reported a surge of subscribers, with net additions of 9.3 million blowing past expectations of 4.8 million. This follows the 13 million subs the streamer added in 2023's fourth quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix said the company will continue to focus and report on other metrics, including operating income, operating margins, net income, free cash flow, earnings per share, and revenue.\n\nStory continues FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is shown on one of their Hollywood buildings in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 12, 2023.

The Magnificent 7 refers to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have dominated the technology sector for years.\n\nThese mega-cap companies have delivered extraordinary returns, shaping the market and our daily lives. However, as with all empires, some continue to rise and others fall causing a shift in dominance. While these growth stocks listed above aren’t necessarily losing their mojo, a few could be replaced with Wall Street’s next generation of favorites.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top growth stocks to challenge Magnificent 7 in 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is undoubtedly one of the top prospects to become a Magnificent 7 killer over the next decade. The company is at the forefront of the AI revolution, set to deliver superior returns and capital to shareholders.\n\nBroadcom is a titan in the semiconductor industry, with diverse product offerings serving the data center, network, broadband, wireless and industrial markets. They power everything from smartphones to IoT devices. With the growing demand for connectivity and cloud offerings, Broadcom stands tall as a major beneficiary. However, investors are most excited about the company’s AI tailwinds, which are set to accelerate revenue, EPS and FCF from operations.

The company underwent major restructuring in 2023, and its new business model and cost-cutting efforts have proven material.\n\nNetflix took serious measures to improve many aspects of their business. Firstly, the company cut costs by $300 million in 2023. Secondly, it finally started to crack down on password sharing, which had been a huge crutch to the business. Moreover, its new ad plan membership was a genius move, boosting its global subscribers while allowing the company to appeal to a wider audience. In FY23, Netflix saw record revenue, earnings and FCF. Net earnings increased 21% YOY to $12.03 per share, with FCF up 328% to a record $6.92 billion. The company is not shying away from the competition in streaming, aiming to unlock new revenue growth opportunities in live gaming and sports-adjacent programming. Netflix’s new strategy is working, and investors should not ignore its margin expansion capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background.

        "content": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary recalled working for Apple Inc. Co-Founder Steve Jobs during a recent interview posted on LinkedIn. While most remember Jobs for building the technology and innovation giant now a part of most Americans' everyday lives, O'Leary said he remembers him for a different reason.\n\nO'Leary made most of his money when he sold The Learning Company to Mattel for $4.2 billion in 1999. But one of O'Leary's business partners in the runup to that acquisition was Apple.\n\n\"We, The Learning Company, were his largest provider for educational software when [Apple] wanted to get into schools with the Mac,\" O'Leary said. This meant O'Leary and Jobs regularly met to make that happen.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire. Retail invested +$2 million in this tech-forward startup taking on a $272 billion industry.\n\n\"He was not a nice guy. He would walk into a room and absolutely berate everybody in there,\" O'Leary said.\n\nO'Leary wasn't the first person to report this. Jobs's daughter wrote a memoir about growing up with her father. The memoir, titled \"Small Fry\" by Lisa Brennan-Jobs detailed callous and potentially abusive scenarios like refusing to pay child support, refusing to install heat in her bedroom and telling her she will get no inheritance.\n\nO'Leary questioned whether the success Jobs saw in his early career would work today. Job's erratic and borderline abusive behavior might not have resulted in the same success decades later.\n\n\"What was it like working for Steve Jobs? It was BRUTAL! He was NOT a nice guy,\" O'Leary said during the interview on LinkedIn.\n\nDespite having this experience with Jobs, O'Leary said something unexpected. Rather than spite for the late tech founder, O'Leary said he admired Jobs.\n\nTrending: Invest alongside execs from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\n\n\"I admired him for his steal vision and getting where he needed to go. He didn't let people get in the way,\" O'Leary wrote.\n\nWhile largely part of his Mr. Wonderful character on \"Shark Tank,\" O'Leary has earned a reputation for being direct and somewhat callous at times. During his time on air, O'Leary is often seen aggressively questioning the valuation of a startup or offering harsh terms to get an investment. While a far cry from statements about Jobs, O'Leary is also an advocate for small businesses and startups, regularly funding businesses across the U.S. and helping entrepreneurs grow their companies to multimillion-dollar exits.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless of whether it would work in today’s corporate world, the results are undisputed. Jobs built one of the largest innovations of the past decade. The startup world can be brutal and unintuitive, but when founders or investors get it right, it can result in a big payday for those involved or changing the world like what happened with Apple.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nJoin the elite.

        "title": "Forget Dividends, Buy These 3 Buyback Behemoths Instead",
        "content": "Buybacks are another way to return cash to shareholders besides dividends. In recent years, buybacks have increased in popularity, exceeding dividends due to their flexibility. Investors are increasingly seeking buyback stocks that return excess cash.\n\nAlthough S&P 500 buybacks declined in 2023, companies continued to favor buybacks over dividends. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, buybacks declined from $922.7 billion in 2022 to $795.2 billion but surpassed dividends of $588.2 billion.\n\nFor companies generating plenty of free cash flow, buybacks might be the best use of cash. They offer flexibility to the company and some tax advantages to investors. What’s more, if done below intrinsic value, buybacks create long-term value for shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese three extremely profitable businesses have spent lots of free cash flow on buybacks in recent years. Each has shrunk its share count by more than 30% since 2014. Today, they are top buyback stocks that continue to use repurchases to shrink share count, thereby boosting EPS and value per share.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis auto parts retailer has been one of the top buyback stocks due to its commitment to share buybacks. Since 2014, it has reduced its outstanding shares by 48%. Moreover, it was among the top repurchasers of 2023, buying back shares worth $3.6 billion and reducing its share count by 6.3%.\n\nThe stable demand for auto parts supports AutoZone’s (NYSE:AZO) free cash flow generation through all economic cycles. When consumers face tight budgets, they keep their old vehicles for longer which adds to repairs. On the other hand, during good times, people drive more. This means their cars frequently need more repairs due to wear and tear.\n\nThese cycle-agnostic characteristics explain why auto parts retailers have been some of the best compounders. Notably, alongside peer O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), AutoZone achieved same-store sales growth in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis. Another tailwind has been the consolidation of the fragmented auto parts retail industry as more independent shops close, ceding share to larger chains.\n\nAutoZone continues to exhibit positive same-store sales growth. In Q2 fiscal year 2024, it reported total same-store sales growth of 1.8%, achieving 4.9% sales growth. So far, it has repurchased $1.7 billion in FY2024. Given its buyback history, expect more returns of excess cash.\n\nHome Depot (HD) a Home Depot store is seen from the outside\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you are a do-it-yourself enthusiast, you must be familiar with Home Depot (NYSE:HD). It is the leading home improvement retailer in the U.S. by sales. The retailer has benefited from a red-hot housing market over the past decade, particularly from the splurge on home improvement projects during the pandemic.\n\nHome Depot’s revenues are evenly split between professional contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. Its focus on the home remodel market has been a growth tailwind, with revenues growing from $83 billion in FY2014 to $152 billion in FY2023. Meanwhile, net income surged from $6.3 billion to $15.1 billion.\n\nLeveraging this surge in profitability, Home Depot has been repurchasing its shares at a fast clip. Although revenues declined in 2023 after the pandemic remodeling boom decelerated, it returned $8 billion in repurchases in FY2023. And management still expects to return excess cash to shareholders, making it one of the top buyback stocks.\n\nOver the long term, Home Depot will profit from an aging housing stock. This will spur more renovations and repairs, boosting demand for the building products and equipment it sells. Moreover, remodel demand will remain elevated, with homeowners having locked in record low mortgage rates and rising home equity.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2012, CEO Tim Cook called Warren Buffet asking for advice on what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should do with its increasing cash hoard. As Cook stated in this CNBC interview, Buffet was straightforward.\n\n“Let me just cut through it. If you believe your stock is undervalued, you should buy your stock,” said Buffet.\n\nEver since, Apple has had the largest repurchase program ever, spending $658 billion over the last ten years.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Apple is one of the most profitable companies on the planet. Its iPhone and iMac products and other accessories have a cult-like following. Furthermore, it has built a high-margin services business around these hardware products. As a result, Apple generates more free cash flow than it knows what to do with.\n\nIn FY2023, the company reported total revenues of $383 billion and net income of 96.9 billion. Additionally, it generated free cash flow of $82 billion using $76.6 billion to buy back its common stock. Repurchase activity continued in Q1 FY2024, with the company buying back 118 million Apple shares worth $20.5 billion.\n\nApple will update its buyback plans in the upcoming earnings report and another substantial repurchase is likely. Although the stock is facing China-related revenue headwinds, an upgrade cycle triggered by an AI iPhone could be the next catalyst. For now, it’s one of the best buyback stocks, with repurchases supporting AAPL stock price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 17 that we would need to see at least two months of \"cooling numbers\" before the Fed even considers to start cutting interest rates. He said many investors have been \"clinging\" to rate cut hopes but the economic activity, jobs market, M&A and IPO activity remains hot, giving the Fed no impetus to ease its monetary policy.\n\nCramer lamented that the market is \"ignoring\" the positives and instead continues to react to weak earnings reports posted by some companies including JB Hun and Prologis.  Jim Cramer added that while he would \"never ever fight\" his viewers who want to sell their stocks right now amid the current market pullback and declines, selling stocks when they are low is not his \"style.\"\n\nCramer said that some \"big picture negatives\" were also weighing the market down. The CNBC host said long-term interest rates were rising, commodity and oil prices were soaring before seeing a decline recently amid hopes that Israel won't react to Iran's missile attacks. However, Cramer said these \"green shoots\" are crushed by the bear quickly, leaving no room for positivity.\n\nA Market That \"Wants to Go Down\"\n\nJim Cramer said that this is a \"market that wants to go down\" and since major stocks like Apple and Tesla are no longer giving a push to the broader market like they did in the recent market, people might think it would make sense to sell out. But Cramer questioned the temptation to immediately sell out of the current market, saying it's never a good idea to sell everything at once.\n\nCramer's Charitable Trust is Selling Stocks\n\nJim Cramer revealed that his charitable trust kept selling stocks \"every day in the last four weeks.\" But Cramer said he didn’t sell his stocks on a decline. Instead, his charitable trust used a strategy called \"scaling out.\"\n\n\"As the stock went higher we sold some shares to raise some cash. If it ever comes back down we can always use that cash to scale back in.\"\n\nThe Fed Might Have \"Jumped the Gun\" Again\n\nCramer said he thinks the market might be seeing a \"short-term peak\" because the Fed might have \"jumped the gun\" even after indicating earlier in the year that there won't be any need for more rate hikes.\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer Said He'd Keep Buying Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nCramer sounded agitated on Abbot's pullback despite posting a quarter that according to Cramer was \"terrific.\" Cramer said when he saw Abbot's stock getting \"annihilated\" despite strong numbers, he knew that market has gone \"too negative.\" Cramer said he bought more Abbot shares on the latest decline. ABT is one of the stocks Cramer is recommending in April. Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's bullish on. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Some top stocks both hedge funds and Cramer love include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer said during his program on April 4 that he likes HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK). Cramer said he had recommended the stock before and it “shot up” before coming down. Cramer said he’s surprised to see the stock price of HighPeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) so low given the skyrocketing oil price.\n\n“I want you to buy High Peak, right here!” Cramer said.\n\nWasatch Micro Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also added HighPeak Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPK), an exploration & production (E&P) company that performs geological and geophysical services, petroleum engineering and drilling. HighPeak is focused on developing unconventional oil and natural gas reserves primarily in the Midland Basin of Texas. We like that the company’s energy reserves contain fewer byproducts than typically found in the reserves of competitors. Prior to our purchase, the stock was down because HighPeak had taken on too much debt. Under the leadership of Jack Hightower, the new chairman and CEO, the company has raised equity—largely from the management team—and has refinanced the debt. Going forward, we think HighPeak is attractive as an independent company or as an acquisition target of a larger competitor. Our confidence in HighPeak is enhanced by Mr. Hightower’s track record of success in the E&P industry and his willingness to put his own money where his mouth is.”\n\n9. Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts about Texas-based Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM). He said Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) is a “good stock” and praised the company’s dividend yield. Cramer also said that Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM) has got mineral rights which make it a suitable play in the current environment since according to Cramer we are in an “inflationary environment” when it comes to oil and minerals.\n\n“I think you’ve got a good one,” Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Viper Energy Inc (NASDAQ:VNOM).\n\nViper talked about guidance and other important updates during its earnings call in February:\n\n\"Our GRP acquisition, which closed in the fourth quarter, clearly laid out the framework that we look for in large-scale M&A. First, it must be accretive on all relevant financial measures. Second, there must be high-quality, undeveloped inventory that supports our long-term growth profile and provides clear visibility to future development. And third, the acquisition must provide significant scale that results in a pro forma business that is both bigger and better. Separately, Viper also completed its conversion into a Delaware corporation during the fourth quarter. We believe this conversion has delivered increased governance rights for our shareholders and positions Viper to grow our business and fully highlight the advantaged nature of mineral and royalty ownership.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we’ve initiated production guidance for both Q1 and the full year. While Q1 is expected to the weakest quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the timing of large pads, we continue to see strong activity levels across our acreage position and expect significant growth to occur throughout the year with 20 — with Q4 2024 production expected to be at or above the high end of our guidance range. This continued production growth, along with our best-in-class cost structure, should enable Viper to continue to return a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders primarily through our base plus variable dividend.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n8. CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer called CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) a “very strong stock” in a latest program on CNBC. He said “I love this” stock and recommended existing CAVA Group Inc (NYSE:CAVA) investors to “stay long.” For those who don’t own the restaurant chain company stock, Cramer’s advice is to “consider” the stock.\n\nIn addition to CAVA, Cramer also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\n7. Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nEarlier in April, Jim Cramer called Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  has been a “horrendous” stock but said that it’s “about to go up.” Cramer said while input costs in the chicken industry are doing down, we are “about to have a chicken price explosion.”\n\nWhen asked why doesn’t he like Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) when its margins are going up, Cramer reiterated that he’s actually recommending people to buy the stock; he just wants Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to lower chicken prices.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 29 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) .\n\nCiting expected profits from chicken and pork segment, Citi recently hiked its price target for Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN)  to $62.\n\nJim Cramer also recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) for long term.\n\n6. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nSolar energy tracking and optimization solutions company Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) is one of the latest stock recommendations of Jim Cramer. A questioner asked Cramer about a recent analyst downgrade for Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT). Cramer said that he “read that downgrade” and believes it was just “someone trying to create a little noise.”\n\nJim Cramer thinks Nextracker Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NXT) “story” is good and said he’d be a buyer of the stock “right here at $52”. Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) shares have pulled back since and as of April 15 morning the stock was trading at around $47.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s New Picks: 5 Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in April Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "The concept of stocks for a hot job market comes at an awkward juncture. From the perspective of the Federal Reserve, it sought an excuse to raise interest rates. Now, with nonfarm payrolls coming in hotter than anticipated, it may not be impossible for a policy pivot to occur.\n\nStill, one alternative proposal is that the central bank may take a modest approach to financial engineering. If so, the robust labor market – while carrying inflationary implications – offers one significant positive: more people have more money to spend. And that extra cash will almost certainly work its way into the economy.\n\nEven with the challenges that we have, Americans continue to spend. Indeed, we’re spending money we don’t have, with credit card debt skyrocketing to $1.13 trillion. Yet the machine keeps marching onward. If you believe that the music won’t stop, below are the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHF Sinclair (DINO) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field. Oil prices and oil price predictions\n\nSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my opinion, the bullish case for HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) sells itself. An independent energy company, HF Sinclair produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and many other petroleum-based products. Thus, it’s a downstream operator, meaning that it focuses on the marketing and refining end of the hydrocarbon value chain. Stated differently, if it goes in your car, it’s downstream.\n\nOne of the cynical factors that make DINO a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market is the broader economic backdrop. Yes, electric vehicles are becoming more commonplace. However, the vast majority of people drive combustion-powered vehicles. Further, when discussing new energy vehicles, it’s hybrids that have dominated the discourse. Guess what? Hybrids need gasoline.\n\nWith more people having jobs, workers make enough to afford the rising prices of gasoline. However, they’re not making so much that they can make the jump to EVs. Therefore, DINO’s assessment as a moderate buy is quite reasonable. Wall Street’s experts believe shares can rise to $66, with the high-side target hitting $78.\n\nCarmax (KMX) a Carmax (KMX) sign on a storefront\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven the recent volatility in used-car dealership Carmax (NYSE:KMX), KMX seems an unusually risky idea for stocks for a hot job market. Indeed, management didn’t offer an encouraging outlook during its most recent earnings call. Further, inflation remains hot (naturally) and borrowing costs are also elevated. This dynamic is hampering demand for big-ticket items.\n\nHowever, the reality is that vehicles – whether they be combustion powered or otherwise – are mechanical products. Mechanical products eventually wear down or in the case of EVs don’t hold their charge. Now, in certain parts of the country (mainly in the east coast), you can get away without having a personal vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nTry that in California or anywhere else. You’re just not going to get that far. And so, we come across a harsh reality: used cars may be an inevitability.\n\nSure, the latest projections for the current fiscal year call for earnings per share of $3.41 on sales of $26.64 billion. That implies very modest growth on the top line. However, because of the necessity of personal transportation, the high-side metrics of $4.10 EPS on revenue of $28.58 billion isn’t out of the question.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the challenges associated with consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is commoditization. When the company launched its first iPhone, it truly revolutionized the world. It singlehandedly pioneered an entirely new product category. Then came other smart devices, which have done the company so well. However, these devices are no longer special and cheaper copycats have sprouted everywhere.\n\nThat said, what I appreciate about the “fruit” brand is that it commands social cachet. It’s not just about the devices but the underlying Apple ecosystem. Therefore, with the unemployment rate coming in lower than expected, people may be incentivized to boost their discretionary spending. If so, I can see Apple leveraging this social cachet to its advantage.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $6.55, a noticeable bump up from last year’s print of $6.13. Now, the top line is much more modest, with projected sales of $386.51 billion less than 1% up from fiscal 2023’s result. However, fiscal 2025 could see sales jump to nearly $412 billion. Thus, AAPL could rank among the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that needs no introduction, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represents one of the top stocks for a hot job market. Fundamentally, the company pioneered the e-commerce revolution. What’s remarkable is that post-pandemic, consumers have gravitated toward online transactions. Significantly, e-commerce transactions as a percentage of total retail sales have been steadily rising since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nBack during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis (Q2 2020), this metric soared to a record 16.5%. It will be difficult to match that level of scope and scale. Yet we’re close, with e-commerce transactions coming in at 15.6% of total sales in Q4 2023. Conspicuously, this rise occurred during a period of rising inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nIt’s possible that consumers may have acclimated to the inflationary paradigm. If so, AMZN could be a compelling idea for stocks for a hot job market. With the unemployment rate so low, people could resume their obsession with online transactions.\n\nPresently, experts rate AMZN a unanimous strong buy with a $212.21 average price target. It’s a reasonable assessment given the underlying relevance.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on broader economic challenges, I’ve been skeptical about the prospects for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Yes, it’s pretty much the reason for existence among suburban America. It may be responsible for maintaining the mental health of white-collar office workers. Yet its caffeinated products are heavily overpriced. You know what I’m talking about if you go to one.\n\nStill, a combination of a robust labor market and broader normalization trends (i.e. return to office) could inspire the need for psychological rewards. People need their caffeine to lift their spirits and admittedly, Starbucks’ products feature an addictive nature. Your brain fills with endorphins the moment you walk in. That’s probably by design.\n\nCovering experts believe the company’s EPS will land at $4.04 in fiscal 2024. That’s a big improvement over last year’s print of $3.54. Also, sales could clock in at $38.75 billion, up 7.7% from 2023’s tally of $35.98 billion.\n\nWhat’s notable is that in fiscal 2025, analysts are seeking revenue of $42.46 billion, up 10% from projected 2024 sales. So, it could be one of the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAn intriguing but risky idea for stocks for a hot job market, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) could potentially benefit from the increase in discretionary funds. To be clear, it’s not an argument without downside concerns. With so many Americans deeply indebted, one of the easiest budget items to cut is entertainment.\n\nThat said, an increase in the employment rate suggests that people will be looking to blow off some steam during happy hours or the weekends. From that angle, DRI stock could make sense. Also, it’s important to consider Darden’s acquisition of premium steakhouse Ruth’s Chris. This buyout could help Darden target the higher-income crowd, who may be looking for distinct experiences.\n\nAnalysts are overall bullish on DRI stock, pegging it a consensus strong buy. Further, for the current fiscal year, they’re anticipating EPS of $8.85, a big improvement over last year’s print of $7.99. As for the top line, the experts are targeting sales of $11.41 billion, up almost 9% from the prior year.\n\nUniversal Technical Institute (UTI) Black college graduation cap laying on a pile of $100 and $20 dollar bills\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/zimmytws\n\nAlthough the labor market is booming, not everyone will win out. That’s just economic reality. On a related point, not everyone will be satisfied with their income. I’d venture to say that with the inflationary pressures, most people are dissatisfied with their compensation. And that’s where Universal Technical Institute (NYSE:UTI) comes into play. Basically, the company provides real skills that are in high demand.\n\nThe company provides vocational education geared toward the transportation or mobility space. What’s really intriguing here is the fading demand for plug-in electric-powered vehicles. Stated differently, combustion-based platforms should enjoy extended relevancy. That means the addressable market for mechanics may be larger than previously anticipated.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are seeking EPS of 70 cents. That’s a huge leap up from last year’s result of 13 cents EPS. Also, revenue is expected to land at $716.09 million. That’s up 17.9% from 2023’s haul of $607.41 million.\n\nFinally, analysts rate UTI a unanimous strong buy with a $17.60 price target. It’s one of the stocks for a hot job market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How a DCF Analysis Supports the Bull Case for Apple",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not been receiving quite as much love from investors as it usually does. The stock is down 9% so far in 2024 against the S&P 500's (SPY) 7% gains through mid-April.\n\nSome of the recent bearishness toward the Cupertino, California-based tech company is founded on short-term concerns. For instance, iPhone sales in the important China market seemed to be under pressure at the start of the year. Others worry more about the core of Apple's business. For example, the company's ecosystem remains under the scrutiny of regulatory agencies around the world. In addition, some fear that Apple may have missed the boat on artificial intelligence.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TJX.\n\nThe bulls, however, may have good reason to cheer the recent pullback as an opportunity to buy the stock at more attractive levels. A discounted cash flow analysis may help to put numbers around the optimism.\n\nTo the benefit of those unfamiliar, DCF is an intrinsic valuation methodology in which future free cash flows produced by a company can be discounted to present value to arrive at a fair value of the stock. Because Apple runs two interdependent but largely dissimilar business segments, namely products and services, I like to think of the stock's value as two separate pieces.\n\nHow much is Apple's products business worth?\n\nProducts is a segment that includes primarily the iPhone, representing roughly half of Apple's total revenues, but also the Mac, iPad as well as wearable and home devices. The products segment featured relatively low margins of 37% in fiscal 2023 compared to the services segment's nearly 71%.\n\nIn isolation, products is an inferior business to services not only because of the lower margins, but also because of less predictability around future revenue, earnings and cash flow. Still, I think is it reasonable to expect Apple's product sales to rise by an average of 5% per year through the next five years, albeit not without year-to-year ebbs and flows.\n\nThe segment would benefit from the iPhone's competitive advantages and brand loyalty, and the full-scale launch of mixed-reality devices. I see this growth rate declining to 3.50% for the next five years before normalizing at a perpetuity growth rate of 2%.\n\nRegarding profitability, I think it is prudent to assume that Ebit margins will level out, despite them having risen lately due to a heavier mix of pricier devices like the iPhone Pro and Pro Max and the margin gains driven by Apple's M-family of chips. On working capital, I also conservatively assume that the company will not produce any additional cash flow, despite having done so in the past several years through tight inventory and payables management.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, I think it is reasonable to discount Apple's future product cash flows at a rate of 12.50%. While this rate seems too high for the company at large, it better reflects the lower growth and higher risk profile of the device business. Using the assumptions above, I estimate the fair value of Apple's product segment is roughly $1.14 trillion.\n\nHow much is Apple's services business worth?\n\nIn my view, the majority of the market value created by Apple comes from the relatively smaller services business. This segment, which represented only 22% of total revenue in fiscal 2023, is much more profitable and produces cash flows more predictably.\n\nOn the first point, services like the App Store and Apple TV+ tend to be highly scalable. While either may generate substantial costs to operate, each marginal dollar in revenue tends to flow straight to operating income, as it produces relatively little in marginal costs. On the latter point, much of Apple's service revenues are either derived from subscriptions or locked in by contract (think about Apple Care as an example). It is no wonder that service revenues have been remarkably stable over time, as the chart below depicts. How a DCF Analysis Supports the Bull Case for Apple\n\nFor the next five years, I assume services will grow sales at an annual rate of 12%, which is consistent with recent history, although conservative relative to how fast service revenue used to grow before last year. On Ebit margins, I assume an expansion of 100 basis points per year through 2028 due to the scale factor mentioned above. I think free cash flow growth then slows down from an average of 12% per year between 2023 and 2028 to 8% between 2029 and 2033, before settling at a much lower perpetuity growth rate of 2% beyond the next decade.\n\nThe discount rate used for services should logically be much lower than that used for Apple's products business. This is the case because of the higher margins, better scalability and lower volatility of future cash flows, as mentioned above. Therefore, I think a discount rate of 7.50% for the services segment, which is three percentage points higher than the 10-year treasury yield, is appropriate.\n\nUsing the assumptions above, I arrive at a fair value of $1.93 trillion for the services segment. Added to products' $1.14 trillion and $51 billion in net cash, Apple stock should then be worth roughly $3.10 trillion or $200 per share, which represents 14% of upside potential to the current price.\n\nRecent dip adds to the margin of safety\n\nOf course, a DCF analysis is only as good as the assumptions that go into it. For instance, I could project that services will grow at 3% per year in perpetuity beyond 2033, and that would give me a fair value on Apple shares of $217.50 for 24% upside potential. Instead, if I assume the discount rate applied to the services business should be 10% instead of 7.50%, then Apple shares would be worth only about $160 for a 10% downside potential.\n\nThe more important point, however, is this year's 9% decline in Apple stock price and 11% pullback since the December 2023 all-time high provides investors with a wider margin of error. Assuming I am right about Apple shares being worth $200, having bought them a mere four months ago would have been a bad move. Buying now instead could produce decent double-digit gains, which I believe will materialize in the next 12 months.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best low cost ETFs. If you want to see the top 5 low cost ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Low Cost ETFs.\n\nBeginner investors usually go for passive investing, with a focus on consistently increasing wealth over the long term with lower fees and reduced risk. In contrast, investors with more experience may have an inclination towards active investing, seeking to profit from short-term shifts in the market. Passive investment plans normally involve investing in a range of stocks, bonds, and other assets to achieve easy diversification. This approach helps in lessening the impact of market volatility as the investment is spread across different assets. Passive funds, like low-cost ETFs or passively managed mutual funds, offer affordable investment choices with lower management fees and less trading activity. It is also relatively easier to maintain them as they do not require as much ongoing research as active funds do. On the other hand, active investing allows portfolio managers to select investments based on their own judgment rather than following a specific index or predetermined portfolio. This flexibility allows them to respond to real-time market conditions and potentially surpass short-term market benchmarks. Active investing often involves active trading strategies like short-selling and hedging to maximize short-term price movements. However, active fund managers generally charge higher fees due to the higher frequency of trading and specific expertise required for this strategy.\n\nIn 2023, global passive equity funds became more popular than active funds for the first time. This shift was driven by investors seeking lower-cost options that follow broad market indices. Passive equity funds reached $15.1 trillion in net assets by December, surpassing the $14.3 trillion held by active funds. This trend towards passive funds began after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought safer investments during uncertain times, as reported by Reuters. In 2023, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) attracted the most inflows, bringing in $52.83 billion. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and Fidelity 500 Index (NASDAQ:FXAIX) followed closely, attracting $38.1 billion and $24.79 billion, respectively. Geoffrey Strotman, senior vice president at Segal Marco Advisors, believes that the increasing popularity of passive funds could lead to pricing discrepancies. This could create opportunities for active managers to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS AG, predicts a comeback for active funds in 2024. He expects Federal Reserve rate cuts to lower borrowing costs, benefiting small-cap companies more than larger ones.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) suggests that investors consider using actively managed strategies more often. They believe that with higher interest rates, ongoing inflation, and increased geopolitical risks, active managers and hedge funds have better chances to outperform simple buy-and-hold portfolios. In the decade leading up to the Covid-19 pandemic, stocks and bonds in developed markets exceeded cash by about 10 and 2 percentage points, respectively, according to BlackRock analysts. Despite this, many investors have been moving away from actively managed funds, with over half of mutual fund and ETF assets in passive products since late last year. At the end of last year, BlackRock managed about $10 trillion in client assets, with $2.6 trillion in active equity, bond, and other strategies, and $6.6 trillion in index and ETF assets. The analysts at BlackRock point out that switching between indexes is a type of active management, enabling investors “to exploit their skill in timing markets and their ability to consistently pick exposure to the right sectors, regions and styles.”\n\nIn this article, we discuss the best low cost ETFs, which offer investors exposure to stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used an ETF screener and filtered out funds with an annual expense ratio of 0.10% and under. We got 44 ETFs which were listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. Then, we manually checked the share price performance for the resultant funds and chose the top 15. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of April 15, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. It is important to note, however, that not all ETFs have been trading for 5 years. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. 15 Best Low Cost ETFs\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nBest Low Cost ETFs\n\n15. Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 15.60%\n\nThe Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS) ranks 15th on our list of the best low cost ETFs. It focuses on investing in companies with a combination of high trailing and future free cash flow yields, which also have a track record of increasing dividends. The fund seeks to mirror the performance of the Kelly US Cash Flow Dividend Leaders Index. Launched on September 13, 2023, the ETF manages assets amounting to $16.05 million as of April 12, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.00%. Its portfolio consists of 55 stocks.\n\nFedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is one of the largest holdings of the Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (NASDAQ:COWS). The company offers e-commerce, transportation, and business services in the US and globally. On March 21, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $3.86, beating estimates by $0.38, and a revenue of $21.7 billion, falling short of estimates by $380 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 70 hedge funds were bullish on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), compared to 67 funds in the previous quarter. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust held the largest position in the company, comprising 1.53 million shares valued at $388.15 million.\n\nIn addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is one of the best stocks to monitor.\n\nArtisan Value Fund stated the following regarding FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Other Q4 laggards were global reinsurer Arch Capital and shipping company FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)—holdings that pulled back following large gains. Back in September 2022, FedEx was selling for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings due to substantial pessimism. Although the demand environment remains challenging globally, particularly in the Express segment, the company is delivering solid earnings growth driven by cost savings initiatives. FedEx’s DRIVE program, which seeks to deliver $4 billion in permanent cost reductions by creating an integrated air-ground network similar to that of rival UPS, is showing progress, and workforce reductions have also been enacted. While operating results can be choppy, FedEx’s longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”\n\n14. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of April 15: 31.15%\n\nNext on our list of the best low cost ETFs is the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR), which aims to reflect the performance of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index, which includes small-cap US stocks.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been a wild mover in recent sessions, blasting off on excitement for AI-centric M4 Macs, only to plunge in the following sessions.\n\nIndeed, Apple’s prior chips featured Neural Engines that helped power various background applications. However, many iPhone users probably viewed the hardware as an afterthought rather than a main draw to buy the latest iPhone.\n\nAfter exploring the possibilities with today’s AI chatbots (like ChatGPT), its AI-focused hardware, such as the Apple Neural Engine, may now be a top selling point as Apple looks to get its many users to upgrade. As AI PCs, smartphones and the AI-powered silicon that powers them enter the chat, things may finally look up for Apple again.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf Apple has what it takes to catch up in AI, the following AI stocks may benefit from its success.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nApple hasn’t been able to replace Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems in its iPhone quite yet. With Apple and Qualcomm extending its modem supply agreement to 2026 and now to March 2027, questions linger as to whether Apple can ever move on from Qualcomm on the modem front.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps the overly ambitious modem plans could share the same fate as Project Titan, the electric vehicle project that Apple has since pulled the plug on.\n\nIn any case, Qualcomm will be supplying modems for the next couple of iPhones. That will likely be enough to benefit from the next iPhone (mini) super-cycle that may very well be powered by new AI hardware, software and services. Beyond Apple, Qualcomm looks well-equipped to benefit from the AI PC and smartphone boom as it makes its own AI chips.\n\nIn short, Qualcomm stands to gain if the iPhone 16 or 17 experiences a big boom in demand, likely from new AI features. That said, it doesn’t solely rely on Apple for its prosperity.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) image of TSM semiconductor office building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) stock is in the process of breaking out right now, with shares just shy of the $140 mark. If Apple helps lead the charge toward AI-powered smartphones, Taiwan Semiconductor may have the final nudge to leave prior highs well behind it.\n\nFurther, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn’t just stand to benefit from an iPhone super-cycle; it stands to benefit from an AI phone boom at large. The $725 billion foundry juggernaut is already showing signs of tailwinds from the AI chip boom, with the firm recently experiencing a sales growth spurt in March, its largest since November 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt this pace, it’s hard not to view TSM stock as one of those AI-at-a-reasonable-price types of plays as more investors move on from some of the more overcrowded AI trades in the market.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a major supplier to Apple, with more than half (sometimes much more than half) of overall revenues derived from the iPhone maker. Indeed, the mobile chip maker’s heavy reliance on Apple can be both a blessing and a curse. Of late, it’s been a curse, with SWKS stock down nearly 50% from its peak, with barely any meaningful momentum for rebound chasers to get excited about.\n\nIf we are on the cusp of an AI iPhone sales boom, perhaps Skyworks stock could gain more than Apple stock. Undoubtedly, Skyworks has taken steps to lower its dependence on Apple over the years. Still, Apple remains the largest customer, which will help the firm pay most of the bills. If AI does help spark a much-awaited iPhone sales super-cycle, perhaps Skyworks’ heavy dependence on Apple will be viewed as a good thing for once.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Apple.

(Igor Golovnov)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock fell 4% last night after a sell-off of global chip stocks and US technology firms.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite fell by over 180 points on Wednesday after the sector was hit by concerns about the Federal Reserve pushing back interest rate cuts, as well as China’s weak economy.\n\nCustomers are holding off on buying as they work through stockpiles, however, China’s buying of less-sophisticated machines has held up amid US restrictions on its access to high-tech equipment.\n\nIt came as ASML (ASML), the largest supplier of equipment to computer chip makers, missed sales forecasts, which sent shares lower.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: Stocks rise as positive corporate results offset drop in European electric car sales\n\nTSMC (TSM)\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has revealed a better-than-projected revenue outlook amid rising demand for AI-related products.\n\nThe Taiwanese chipmaking company, whose clients include Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), stuck with plans to spend as much as $32bn (£25.66bn) in 2024.\n\nTSMC has gained about $340bn of market value since an October 2022 trough, riding bets it will become a top winner of a global boom in AI development. It posted a better-than-expected rise of 9% in net income to NT$225.5bn ($7bn) for the March quarter.\n\n“Looking at 2024 as a whole, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, potentially weighing on consumer sentiment and end-market demand,” Wei told analysts on a conference call.\n\nLaster this month, TSMC also said it would build a third semiconductor factory in Arizona, raising its total investment in the United States to $65bn.\n\nIt already had plans to build two plants in Arizona, and another one in Germany.\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nEasyJet shares climbed more than 3% on Thursday as it narrowed its losses despite losing revenue from cancelled flights to Israel and Jordan last winter.\n\nThe budget airline took a £40m hit from the Middle East conflict but still managed to trim losses for the six months to the end of March by over £50m, to between £340m and £360m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was against losses of £411m a year earlier, and comes alongside an increase of 18% in fuel costs, adding 6% inflation per seat.\n\nIt also benefitted from the early timing of Easter this year, which led to more demand for flights during March.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin price falls ahead of halving as ETF inflows slow\n\n\"The importance that consumers place on travel coupled with easyJet’s trusted brand has driven good demand for our flights and holidays.

This was due to a market weakened by a lack of clients investing in 5G technology.\n\nThe Finland-based firm reported a net profit of €501m (£429m, $535m) for the January to March period, up 46% from €342m the previous year.

        "title": "Worried About Apple Stock Now That the Company's Lost the Smartphone Lead? Read This Before Making Any Big Moves",
        "content": "The headlines certainly seem alarming. Reports are coming out showing that iPhone sales fell 10% year over year in 2024's first quarter. The setback was so stark, in fact, that Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) lost the top spot in the world's smartphone market share race that it held just a quarter earlier!\n\nAs is too often the case, though, such headlines fail to include a great deal of important context. Here's the rest of what you need to know about this week's news before deciding whether you need to dump your stake in Apple stock.\n\nThe iPhone loses its top spot ... again\n\nThe data comes from technology market research outfit IDC. In its most recent look at worldwide smartphone shipments, it reported that Apple delivered 50.1 million iPhones during the three months ending in March. That's 10 million fewer than the number Samsung(OTC: SSNL.F) delivered in the same quarter. That's also a marked difference from the final quarter of last year when 80.5 million iPhones were shipped versus Samsung's count of 53 million.\n\nThis market-share shift led Reuters to write a story with the headline \"Apple loses top phonemaker spot to Samsung as iPhone shipments drop.\" Bloomberg's headline \"Apple faces worst iPhone slump since Covid as rivals rise\" is even more worrisome.\n\nTo be fair, both headlines are technically accurate. However, there are a couple of relevant details worth expounding on.\n\nThe first of these details is simply that this shift isn't abnormal. Apple is usually displaced as the global smartphone market leader between the fourth quarter and the following Q1. In fact, as the image below illustrates, in seven out of the past eight years Apple has lost its Q4 market share lead to Samsung during the following Q1. Data source: IDC. Chart by author.\n\nWhy? The iPhone is a popular gift during the holiday shopping season. Samsung smartphones aren't. Samsung-made smartphones are, however, historically better sellers over the course of a full year.\n\nThe other detail worth understanding is a semi-related one. That is, Apple started Q1 2024 at a disadvantage. People's response to the Q4 2023 release of the iPhone 15 was so strong that there weren't many interested buyers who didn't already own one by Q1. Data source: IDC. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\n\nAlso bear in mind that a handful of analysts -- including Morgan Stanley's -- suggest many iPhone fans may be holding out for the iPhone 16 that's likely to debut later this year.\n\nThat's just a guess, of course, but not an unreasonable one given that a lot of actively used iPhones are now several years old. Indeed, the iPhone 11 -- released in 2019 -- is still the world's most used iPhone, according to a recent report from Scientiamobile. Since these devices are now nearly five years old, their owners won't be able to wait much longer to make the upgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nScientiamobile's data adds that the iPhone 12 and 13 are also now the second- and third-most used Apple smartphones. They're quickly approaching the end of their useful lives too.\n\nNot a reason to dump your Apple stock\n\nDon't read too much bullishness into these added details. Apple's still got some tough challenges ahead, to be sure.\n\nJust look at the bigger picture as an example. Even though Q4 iPhone sales were strong, the longer-term trend is a stagnant one. The company's not really shipping any more iPhones now than it was several years ago. iPhone revenue itself has been similarly stagnant since late 2020 as well, with the average selling price of the iPhone arguably reaching its peak. Given that about half of Apple's top line comes from sales of the iPhone, there's cause for concern.\n\nBut the situation isn't quite as dire as this week's headlines would suggest. A subpar Apple is still a stronger company and a better investment prospect than plenty of other corporations on their best days. If nothing else, Apple is a cash-generating juggernaut. It can buy whatever growth it may no longer be able to create organically.\n\nThat's the long way of saying Apple's Q1 smartphone stumble isn't nearly as big a deal as it's being made out to be in some of these headlines. There may be better options out there, but you could certainly do a lot worse than sticking with this one for a while longer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple CEO to Meet Singapore Leader to Wrap Whirlwind Asia Tour",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is meeting Singapore’s leader at the tail end of his most extensive Southeast Asia tour in years, searching for new growth markets and manufacturing locations to offset headwinds in China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDubai Grinds to Standstill as Cloud Seeding Worsens Flooding Elon Wants His Money Back Singapore Loses ‘World’s Best Airport’ Crown to Qatar Red Lobster Considers Bankruptcy to Deal With Leases and Labor Costs Tesla Asks Investors to Approve Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Again\n\nCook will be in Singapore on Thursday and Friday to meet with Lawrence Wong, who is set to take over as Prime Minister next month, as well as his predecessor Lee Hsien Loong, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the executive’s itinerary isn’t public.\n\nApple’s CEO is on the verge of concluding a highly public tour that’s taken him from Hanoi to Jakarta, during which he repeatedly stressed the region’s importance as both a market and emergent manufacturing base. His company is looking for growth markets beyond China, a traditional stronghold where demand for its flagship iPhone is sputtering. The company is also diversifying its production beyond the communist country to reduce risks at a time of elevated tensions between the world’s two biggest superpowers.\n\nFrom meetings with country leaders in Vietnam and Indonesia to interactions with local customers, Cook has filled a lion’s share of his schedule with publicity activities to generate interest in the brand, the people said. Apple has already increased its retail presence and output in countries such as India, and is now seeking to better tap a relatively fast-growing Southeast Asian market with more than 650 million consumers.\n\nThe trip could pave the way for a more aggressive sales campaign in a densely populated region where Android phones from Samsung Electronics Co., Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo dominate the market, said one of the people.\n\nAs part of the push, the company is getting close to opening the first Apple Store in Malaysia, located in an extravagant shopping complex in Kuala Lumpur. Apple currently operates five brick-and-mortar stores in Southeast Asia, three in Singapore and two in Thailand, according to its website.\n\nThe Singapore plans are subject to change, and Apple hasn’t made Cook’s schedule in the region public. Representatives for Apple, Singapore’s Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nApple, which has operated in Singapore for over 40 years, said Wednesday it plans to invest $250 million to expand its campus in the city-state. The company employs more than 3,600 people there and said the expansion will provide space for new roles in artificial intelligence and other functions.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Singapore is truly a one-of-a-kind place, and we are proud of the connection we’ve built with this dynamic community of creators, learners, and dreamers,” Cook said in a statement on Apple’s website. “With our growing campus, Apple is writing a new chapter in our history here.”\n\nIn the first leg of the tour, Cook met with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday after pledging new investment in the country. He said Apple plans to buy more components and accessories for its devices from Vietnam’s suppliers, a big boost for the country as it emerges as a global electronics hub.\n\nIn Indonesia on Wednesday, Cook told President Joko Widodo Apple is weighing the possibility of making some of its gadgets there. The two also discussed Indonesia’s controversial new trade rule to get more goods produced onshore, one of the people said.\n\nIn the most significant policy move resulting from Cook’s trip, the Indonesian government said Thursday it’ll weigh incentives to attract more investment from Apple. Those might include tax breaks, Coordinating Maritime Affairs and Investment Minister Luhut Panjaitan said in a video statement, adding the country might copy India and Thailand in taking such steps.\n\nSoutheast Asia has become an increasingly important market for Apple because of weak demand in China. The Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in the country since the debut of its latest iPhone 15 series, resulting in a 10% decline in first-quarter shipments. Beijing’s bans on the use of iPhones in government agencies and state-owned companies cast further uncertainty on Apple’s prospects in China.\n\nWhile India is expected to become a major long-term driver, the iPhone accounts for less than 10% of the smartphones sold there now in part because of its lofty price tag.\n\n--With assistance from Philip J. Heijmans, Norman Harsono and Eddie Spence.\n\n(Updates with potential Indonesia incentives in 12th paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAging Copper Mines Are Turning Into Money Pits Despite Demand For Multinationals, Africa’s Allure Is Fading The AI Chatbot That Could Transform Business School Accreditation Premiums Are Rising, and Insurers Say Lawsuits Are to Blame A Very Bad Week for Tesla, Its Employees and Even Elon Musk\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

Apple, which accounted for about a quarter of its revenue in 2023, started the year with a deep decline in Chinese iPhone sales.\n\nFor a liveblog on TSMC’s earnings, click here.\n\nTSMC has gained about $340 billion of market value since an October 2022 trough, riding bets it will become one of the clearest winners of a global boom in AI development. The company set a 2024 capital expenditure budget of $28 billion to $32 billion at the start of the year.\n\nIt said in January it expects revenue to grow by at least 20% this year as the broader semiconductor market recovers, though uncertainty persists given global macroeconomic volatility. Key supplier ASML Holding NV — the sole provider of the world’s most advanced chipmaking machines — reported a 22% miss on first-quarter bookings Wednesday.\n\nLonger term, investors expect AI-focused chips to gradually take up a larger proportion of revenue. TSMC’s AI revenue is growing at a rate of 50% annually, the company said in January. Still, some investors have warned that the current level of AI chip demand is unsustainable over the long run.

        "title": "Tech earnings season is coming, and AI is top of mind",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and the rest of their Big Tech cohorts are gearing up for what is expected to be one of the more eventful earnings seasons in some time. Generative AI will no doubt be top of mind as the push to monetize the technology continues and investors look for any indication that those billions of dollars in investments are starting to pay off.\n\n“We're forecasting it to be about an 8% growth as a kind of collective growth number for the large-cap technology companies,” said Alex Smith, head of Canalys' channels research department. “In terms of overall growth, Nvidia is going to far outstrip the rest of the market.”\n\nBut generative AI isn’t the only thing on investors’ minds. Apple’s earnings should prove eventful after the company’s rough start to the year, with the iPhone maker facing everything from antitrust lawsuits to slowing sales in China, one of its most important markets.\n\nMeta (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), meanwhile, will give Wall Street a sense of how the digital advertising market is performing. Both companies saw sales increase in the prior quarter, but Alphabet fell shy of analysts’ expectations. The search giant will need to flip the script this quarter.\n\nStrap in because it’s going to be a wild few weeks.\n\nGenerative AI takes center stage again\n\nThe generative AI explosion is still reverberating across Wall Street as shares of heavy hitters like Nvidia and Microsoft continue to soar. But after a year of hype, companies will need to start showing that the excitement is paying off. Microsoft will report earnings on April 25 as investors wait to learn more about how the company is monetizing its AI strategy. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\n“We can be absolutely sure that the first and most important thing that investors are going to be eyeballing is companies kind of taking their AI washing [saying something uses AI even if it doesn’t] and turning it into meaningful contributions to the top and bottom line,” Daniel Newman, CEO of the technology advisory and research firm The Futurum Group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up roughly 75% year-to-date and 225% over the past 12 months, as hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta grab as many of the company’s AI chips as possible. That’s sent Nvidia’s revenue through the roof. In Q4, Nvidia reported revenue of $22.1 billion, up from $6.1 billion in the prior year.\n\nBut the company is going to begin lapping its explosive growth numbers this year, which could put a damper on investor enthusiasm even if it continues to outperform.\n\n“You've had these massive blowouts but as soon as you start to lap that first year of massive blowouts, then it's going to be more average growth numbers,” said TECHnalysis Research president Bob O’Donnell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s not to say Nvidia will relinquish its lead in the market anytime soon. It’s still miles ahead of rivals AMD and Intel in terms of market share, and it just debuted its Blackwell architecture during its GTC developer conference in March, which should put it even further ahead. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks about processing units during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., on March 18. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“They still have a commanding lead and share, and their influence is huge, and they are not slowing down, to their credit,” O’Donnell said. “But the law of big numbers starts to kick in at a certain point.”\n\nThen there are the hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Google. While they’ve been riding the AI hype train, many of their generative AI software offerings are still in the works, meaning it’s a bit early to get a full read on overall uptake among enterprise and consumer customers. Still, Wall Street will likely be looking for at least some revenue growth from the companies’ AI investments.\n\n“How much is AI driving [Microsoft’s] Azure? How much is AI driving Google Cloud growth? How much is it continuing to help AWS which has sort of seen its numbers slow,” said Newman.\n\nIn its last quarter, Microsoft announced that AI services contributed 6 percentage points of growth to its Azure revenue, up from 3 percentage points in the prior quarter. And you can bet analysts will be looking to see if the company can keep that kind of growth up in the current quarter.\n\nAmazon also pointed to AI as a growth catalyst during its last earnings call, saying revenue was \"accelerating rapidly\" as customers showed interest in the technology. It will be interesting to see if the company provides any more context around that acceleration in its upcoming earnings call.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGoogle, like Microsoft, will also likely face questions about sales of its AI-enhanced productivity suite and how customers are responding. The company, which will host its I/O developer conference in May, has also faced controversy over its AI rollout, pulling back its Gemini AI generator after it generated historically inaccurate images.\n\nApple on deck\n\nApple’s earnings will also be a hot ticket but don’t expect the company to reveal anything about its future generative AI plans.\n\n“Apple needs to disclose something, but the company has never really been in a hurry to pacify industry investors,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy. “I think they're going to wait until WWDC in a couple of months to bring that out.”\n\nOutside of AI, investors are eagerly anticipating Apple’s iPhone revenue numbers and commentary on its lawsuits. On Monday, market intelligence firm IDC reported that global iPhone shipments fell nearly 10% in the current quarter. That could have a significant impact on Apple’s overall revenue.\n\nSales in China are also a problem for the company. Apple reported revenue in its third-largest market declined 13% in the prior quarter. That, coupled with falling iPhone shipments, could spell trouble for the company’s earnings.\n\nDespite those headwinds, however, there could be a bright spot. According to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple should report double-digit growth in its Services segment, which could help buoy overall sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe company’s upcoming earrings will also give investors their first glimpse into Vision Pro sales, which should offer some insight into early consumer and enterprise interest in the AR/VR headset.\n\nDigital advertising sales on the rise\n\nMeta and Google will also be on deck to show whether they can keep up the momentum in the digital advertising market. In the prior quarter, Meta’s ad sales jumped 24%, while Google’s ad sales, including YouTube ads, increased 11%.\n\nAmazon, which has built its own impressive advertising business, could also see continued ad sales growth. In the prior quarter, the company reported advertising revenue of $14.7 billion, up 27% year over year. Another performance like that could provide a nice boost to the company’s bottom line.\n\nAnalysts will also be on the lookout to see if AI is impacting advertising sales.\n\n“Theoretically, targeting should be better by using AI even with the deprecation of the cookie, but we haven't seen that yet,” Moorhead said. “To me, the evidence that I would have to see is a higher cost per click or a better CPM.”\n\nWe’ll find out all of that and more when Big Tech earnings kick off next week.

        "title": "‘Meta is out of options’: EU regulators reject its privacy fee for Facebook and Instagram",
        "content": "It looks like Meta’s strategy of charging European Facebook and Instagram users, for the privilege of not being tracked for ad-targeting purposes, ain’t gonna fly.\n\nMeta introduced the subscriptions late last year in an attempt to grapple with the implications of a bombshell July ruling by the EU’s highest court, which found that Meta had no legal basis for tracking its users across its services and third-party sites unless it got their express consent to do so. But privacy advocates swiftly complained, arguing that it’s not real consent if the only alternative is shelling out yet another monthly subscription fee—originally as much as €12.99 ($13.82) for an account used on both mobile and the web, before Meta last month proposed a drop to €5.99 as a way of mollifying its critics.\n\nToday, Politico first reported that the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)—the umbrella organization for the EU’s various privacy regulators—had decided that the privacy advocates complaining about what they derisively called Meta’s “pay or okay” model had a point.\n\n“In most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee,” the EDPB said in its opinion, published later in the day.\n\nEDPB Chair Anu Talus said platforms “should give users a real choice when employing ‘consent or pay’ models,” adding: “The models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay. As a result most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices.”\n\n“Overall, Meta is out of options in the EU,” said Max Schrems, the Austrian activist lawyer whose 13-year legal crusade against Meta is what gradually removedthoseoptions, in a statement. “It must now give users a genuine yes/no option for personalized advertising. It can still charge pages for reach, engage in contextual ads and alike—but tracking people for ads needs a clear ‘yes’ by users.”\n\nMeta has tried using various legal justifications for scooping up and processing European users’ personal data over the years since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018—with each being successively shot down by regulators as being an unacceptable reading of the privacy law. First Meta claimed that this tracking was part of its user contract, then that it had a “legitimate interest” in conducting targeted advertising, and now that it’s getting genuine consent from those who choose to avoid the new fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSchrems claimed that the introduction of subscription fees as the alternative increased the proportion of people agreeing to be tracked from 3% to over 90%. “You don’t need a lawyer to see that it’s not ‘freely given’ consent,” he said. “In fact, five years after the GDPR came into force, this is just the latest ‘trick’ to undermine EU law or at least delay compliance for a few more years.”\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nIn other European regulatory news, Apple’s latest beta version of iOS makes it possible for EU iPhone users to directly download apps from developers’ websites, rather than having to use an app store. Originally reported by MacRumors, that is part of Apple’s tortuous journey toward compliance with the new Digital Markets Act, a blockbuster antitrust law. There are conditions, though, including Apple’s insistence that apps can only be eligible if they’ve already had at least a million first installs on iOS in the EU, in the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission is miffed that TikTok launched a new “TikTok Lite” app in France and Spain before conducting a legally required risk assessment about its potential impact on young people’s mental health, in particular “potential stimulation of addictive behavior,” Reuters reports. The app, which is supposed to be for over-18s, rewards its use with points that can be exchanged for Amazon vouchers and the like. TikTok—which the Commission is already formally investigating under the new online-content law known as the Digital Services Act—now has all of one day to submit that risk assessment. Oops.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMD.\n\nAMD is one of the most compelling companies working in AI chip development, but its most significant, and certainly stronger, competitor is Nvidia. For quite some time, I have been concerned about whether the valuation of the stock is too risky, and it is fair to say the investment comes with potential valuation drawbacks, even though the company's future growth looks good. I do believe the market has slightly gotten ahead of itself here with too much enthusiasm, and a correction could occur. But it must be said that AMD is firing on all cylinders as it relates to becoming even more significant in AI and, as such, I can see why the market has placed such a premium on the shares. One has to question, though, whether this premium is market enthusiasm or wider speculation from non-professional investors who are not tuned in enough to the fundamentals and instead just want to invest in AI.\n\nThe company is not just a powerhouse in advanced chips, where its production of central processing units and graphics processing units are key to operating AI technologies. It also offers a range of products and services for high-level computers. It is becoming apparent that it may be able to offer some competitive advantage over Nvidia in certain areas. While Nvidia is focused long term on the full-stack market for AI, similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, but specializing in AI services, AMD is focused on selling elite capabilities of compute at good value for money. The company is focusing on performance per dollar and innovative technologies at accessible prices, but the market notices this is an exceptional strategy. Unfortunately, it perhaps leaves little room for outside investors to reap the benefits at this time without taking on excess valuation risk because of how widely spread it is being accepted that AMD's strategy is onto something vital.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeer analysis\n\nMy research has shown me that Nvidia's current position in the market is undoubtedly the strongest. In second place behind it, I believe, is AMD. But also important are Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) in GPUs, ARM, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in CPUs and servers and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), Samsung (SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in custom semiconductor solutions. It is quite clear that the clever and best companies involved in technology software and hardware want to flesh out their own AI divisions, but there still comes the point where some outsourcing is necessary for top-level results. Apple produces its own chips now, which is its role in custom solutions, but other computer manufacturers who do not have the same trillion-dollar-plus market cap are going to be looking to Nvidia, AMD, Intel and others to provide the chips to fuel the demand for ever-increasing power in laptops, desktops and intelligent devices.\n\nAs smaller hardware companies seek to join the ranks of companies who offer AI integrated with devices, I believe AMD has the strongest competitive positioning if it continues to hone in on cost-effective advanced CPUs and GPUs. By doing so, it caters to a critical part of the market that other providers would be less focused on as they serve the larger, full-stack needs of conglomerates, big data companies and those working with highly advanced technology like robotics.\n\nHowever, suppose AMD fails to flesh out its AI ecosystem effectively. In that case, it might lose out in its current target market to Nvidia more than investors are currently pricing into the stock. What customers are going to want is ease of access to advanced AI tasks. Beyond pure compute provision, a unified platform to manage AI workloads that Nivida is aiming for with its full-stack approach may be much more compelling in the long run as AI tasks become more complex and demand for advanced capabilities scales. This should apply even to smaller companies that can afford it. While AMD has partnerships to help in this regard, its profitability will suffer if it does not provide the core foundation for the demanded capabilities.\n\nOn that note, I am particularly keen on AMD's balance sheet, which shows an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.82. In comparison, Nvidia's ratio is 0.65, while Broadcom's is just 0.40. I believe AMD's strength in its balance sheet will serve it well with any needs that may arise where it needs to invest more heavily in full-stack solutions. The company can notably take on more debt without too much damage to its financial agility or sense of security for shareholders.\n\nValuation\n\nFirst, consider the following chart, which presents the main valuation multiples of what I consider to be some of the most competitive peers to AMD:\n\nAMD Nvidia Intel Broadcom ARM P/E Ratio Without NRI 116 71.6 35.8 32.4 165.6 P/S Ratio 12 35.6 2.9 15 44.6 P/FCF Ratio 241.8 80.4 NM 31.5 171.9\n\nFrom the above chart, it is quite clear that AMD sells at a very high multiples, but we can also see its multiples are not uncommon in its industry for the major players, other than its free cash flow ratio, which is the highest of all the five peers listed. I believe there is some truth to the statement that AMD is investing heavily in future growth, so it is taking a profitability hit in the near term in exchange for long-term gains. I do believe AMD will stabilize its profitability in due course, and then its price-earnings multiples will become much more tolerable. But as we can see, its revenue growth has shown to be very promising, which is indicated in the lower price-sales ratio against Nvidia, ARM Holdings and Broadcom.\n\nIn my opinion, the valuation for AMD is not intolerable, but it certainly exposes investors to a lot of risks if it struggles in achieving expectations or if it struggles to manifest long-term profitability at a scale that investors are currently anticipating. It has proven it can generate rapid and lasting revenue growth, and I am certain in time, it will translate this into a stronger bottom line, but there is also the consideration of growing expenditures to remain competitive, especially as it relates to my comments about it not having a full-stack ecosystem, which it may decide it needs to develop, albeit at a smaller scale to Nvidia, to remain relevant. Therefore, I can see some long-term risk here which could cause present enthusiasm to deflate, and I think investors who bought in at present prices run the risk of losing a significant amount of capital if adverse conditions arise.\n\nPutting the AI market valuation risks into perspective\n\nI view AMD very favorably, so I think the market has priced the shares high for a reason. Based on my research of the industry, I have come to believe the present AI enthusiasm is not a bubble like during the internet boom of the 1990s. Instead, the results of this technological shift look to be much more profound and lasting, but the potential for speculative behavior still remains. While in the 1990s, many companies went to zero, in this period, I believe the potential for speculation simply means more likelihood of volatility.\n\nI do not think we will see as many failed companies, primarily due to the expensive barriers to entry, but also because the financial benefits of AI will cause fundamental growth like margin expansion and potential deflationary effects on the wider economy. That will make AI businesses worth much more than dot-com companies were over the long term. AMD has proven itself to be a stand-out player, and so the likelihood is short-to-medium-term volatility with long-term growth. Now just does not seem to be the most prudent time to allocate to the company as a value investor.\n\nKey takeaway\n\nI think AMD could have periods of turbulence, but as long as it continues to allocate its resources with an effective strategy aimed at value and does not find it needs to invest too heavily in expensive new technologies, which may disrupt its long-term profitability, I believe the long-term returns should be good. It is not quite right for my risk appetite, and I do not believe it works for investors heavily focused on stock valuations, but nonetheless, the company's operations are undeniably strong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon, Apple initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nTD Cowen upgraded e.l.f. Beauty(ELF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $190, down from $220. The firm sees the potential for e.l.f. to double its business by fiscal 2027 with shelf space and international expansion as the driving forces. HSBC upgraded Danaher (DHR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $280, up from $250. HSBC's supply chain analysis suggests the de-stocking effects as well as order books might be on a recovery path for the life sciences tools sector. Wells Fargo upgraded Omnicom (OMC) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $106, up from $91. The firm sees upside to the company's organic growth from new business, media trends and \"Flywheel.\" Morgan Stanley upgraded Antero Resources(AR) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $36, up from $26. The firm sees the company providing attractive leverage to rising gas prices and leading exposure to the growing liquified natural fairway in the Gulf Coast. Guggenheim upgraded Group 1 Automotive(GPI) to Buy from Neutral with a $305 price target, calling it the \"best positioned dealer\" to navigate the current landscape, which is \"somehow trading at [the] lowest multiple.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nNorthcoast downgraded Boeing (BA) to Sell from Neutral with a $140 price target. The firm expects Boeing's quarterly earnings report in two weeks to prompt concerns about the company's underlying fundamentals and ultimately shift investor focus to liquidity and acquisition concerns. JPMorgan downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $90, down from $95. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Focus List. The company's Precision Technologies order trends have remained sluggish so far this year, with sales likely down through the first half of 2024 despite support from an excess backlog that is close to being exhausted, JPMorgan says. Jefferies downgraded Urban Outfitters(URBN) to Underperform from Hold with a price target of $32, down from $42. The firm's latest data shows a \"notable deceleration\" in rolling three-month foot traffic to all three of Urban's brands. Wells Fargo downgraded EQT Corporation (EQT) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $37, down from $48. The firm acknowledges that the recently announced merger with Equitrans Midstream (ETRN) should position the company as a unique \"Gas E&P + Midstream\" entity, resembling a mini super-major, but says it is clear the E&P and midstream investor communities will take some time to embrace this integrated model, versus the prevailing preference for pure-play narratives. Piper Sandler downgraded Marsh McLennan(MMC) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $211. The shares are now \"reasonably valued\" and there is not much in the way of future catalysts that will change that, the firm says.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nMaxim initiated coverage of Amazon.com(AMZN) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm believes the company will be able to exploit consumer internet trends that include advertising, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, healthcare, logistics, and over-the-top, or OTT, video. Maxim initiated coverage of Apple (AAPL) with a Hold rating and $178 price target. Apple is too dependent on China, from a sales and supply-chain standpoint, and it is overweight a single product, the iPhone, when it comes to its near-term operating results, the firm says. Maxim initiated coverage of Beyond (BYND) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm contends that the company will be able to exploit the Consumer Internet trends of 2024 that include international expansion as well as Blockchain and Mobile opportunities. Raymond James initiated coverage of GE Vernova(GEV) with an Outperform rating and $160 price target.  The firm looks at Vernova as a mid-single-digit growth story, with power lagging behind wind and electrification. Mizuho initiated coverage of Royal Caribbean(RCL) with a Buy rating and $164 price target. Royal has a unique mix of quality ship assets, as well as differentiated destinations, the combination of which drives upside potential to estimates, says the firm.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia",
        "content": "In this article, we will list the 20 most diverse countries in Asia. If you want to skip our discussion about diversity in the United States and its benefits, go to the 5 Most Diverse Countries in Asia.\n\nThe United States is one of the most diverse countries, as there is a 52% (as of 2013, according to the Historical Index of Ethic Fractionalization) probability that two people selected at random in the country belong to different ethnicities. It is also on its way to becoming a majority-minority country, where there will be as many minority residents as there are majority residents.\n\nAccording to current projections, non-Hispanic whites will make less than 50% of the US population by 2044. It is the top migrant country in the world, where thousands of immigrants find their homes every year. Nearly four out of ten residents in the country identify with a nonwhite race.\n\nForeign-born essential workers increased to 19.8 million in 2022. Collectively, these migrant workers have a spending power of $1.3 trillion, and so they are one of the primary drivers of economic growth. This growing diversity is essential for the country, as it has an aging population. So, immigrant flow and population growth are important for retaining the prime-age working population in the United States.\n\nDespite the importance of diversity, Americans express differing views on the subject. According to Pew research, majority of the population (64%) is indifferent about diversity as it perceives the long-term growth of racial and ethnic diversity as neither good nor bad for the country. In addition, a significant minority of 11% perceive this long-term diversity growth negatively.\n\nOnly about 24% of US residents look favorably over the increasing diversity. However, despite this, most Americans (66%) are satisfied with the racial mix of their area. In addition, black Americans place a higher value on workspace diversity and school integration compared to other ethnicities. School integration is the term used for promoting racially and ethnically mixed classrooms in schools.\n\nNumerous studies have found a positive relationship between diversity and inclusion and economic growth. The French government concluded in 2015 that it would gain 150 billion Euros or 6.9% of its GDP by improving the accessibility of minorities and women. Studies have also shown that diversity and inclusion also has a positive impact on a company's profitability. This is demonstrated in the 'Diversity Matters Even More' report by McKinsey & Company. It is the fourth in a series of reports by the consultancy firm to investigate the business case for diversity.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the report, companies that fall in the top quartile of ethnic representation have a 39% increased likelihood of outperformance compared to those in the bottom quartile. The report also makes a strong case for gender diversity as companies with more than 30% women representation were found to be significantly more likely to financially outperform those with less representation. It also stresses the importance of diversity in top positions, as those in the top quartile for gender and ethnic diversity in executive teams were found to be 9% more likely to outperform others. Meanwhile, those in the bottom quartile for gender and ethnic diversity in executive teams are 66% less likely to outperform their peers.\n\nMany companies understand the importance of diversity. Mastercard, Inc. (NYSE:MA) is one of the companies that is committed to nurturing diversity and maintaining an equitable workforce. Mastercard, Inc. (NYSE:MA) also emphasizes equal pay, and as of 2021, women in the company earn a dollar for every dollar that men earn. Mastercard, Inc. (NYSE:MA) also offers practical employee benefits to cater to diversity in all forms. Some of these benefits include coverage for sex reassignment surgery and surrogacy.\n\nSome companies like Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are at the forefront of promoting diversity. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has committed $100 million to its Racial Justice Initiative. As part of this initiative, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also announced a new Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, which aims at helping African Americans acquire coding skills.\n\nWe have previously looked at the least diverse countries in the world. However, in this list, we will focus on the most diverse countries in Asia. There are six distinct geographic segregations of the continent with each having its own unique racial characteristics. These geographical divisions are Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia. The most prominent ethnic groups in central Asia are Uzebks, Kazakhs, Tajik, Turkmen, and Kyrgyz. Korean, Han, and Yamoto make up the major ethnic groups in Central Asia.\n\nWe that backdrop, let's look at the most diverse countries in Asia.  20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia\n\nCRS PHOTO/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the 20 most diverse countries in Asia, we consulted the Historical Index of Ethnic Fractionalization (HIEF), made available publicly by Harvard Dataverse. The index mentions the ethnic fractionalization of countries from 1945 to 2013. Ethnic fractionalization refers to the probability that two people selected at random in the country will belong to different ethnicities. So, the higher this figure, the more ethnically diverse the country is. For our article, we used 2013 figures as these were the latest. It is also worth noting that the index did not include some major Asian countries such as India. All the ethnic fractionalization figures on our list are rounded to the nearest percentage.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional looking for the best stocks to buy you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20 - Taiwan\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 37%\n\nTaiwan is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. While its population is predominantly Han Chinese, there are 16 officially recognized indigenous tribes in the country. According to the Taiwanese government, these tribes represent more than 2.5% of the population in the country. The Han Chinese people living in Taiwan belong to two major subgroups: the Hokkien (native Taiwanese) and Haka, who migrated to the country from China’s Guangdong province.\n\n19 - Israel\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 38%\n\nIsrael is one of the few countries where the majority of the people or their parents were born in other countries. Jews constitute the largest religious group in the country and belong to varying ethnicities. They migrated to the country from Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, and Latin America. More than one-fifth of the population in the country consists of Arabs, most of which are Muslim.\n\n18 - Singapore\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 40%\n\nSingapore is 18th on our list of the 20 most diverse countries in Asia. The country has a history of considerable migration in the past, with Chinese making up for three-fourths of the population. The second largest ethnic group in the country is Malays. In addition, at least four official languages are recognized in the country: English, Singaporean Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil.\n\n17 - Iraq\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 45%\n\nArabs and Kurds are the major ethnicities in Iraq. Its Arab population is divided into Shi'i Muslims and Sunni Muslims. Kurds are arguably the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East, following Arabs, Turks, and Persians.\n\n16 - Turkey\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 52%\n\nWith an ethnic fractionalization of 52%, Turkey is as diverse as the United States. However, different ethnicities are genetically closely related. While the majority of the population are Turks, Kurds, Zaza Kurds, Circassians, Bosniaks, Georgians, Albanians, and Arabs make up the major minority ethnicities. More than 72% of the country's population is Turk, while Kurds and Zaza Kurds make up more than 16%.\n\n15 -Kazakhstan\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 54%\n\nKazakhstan is 15th on our list of the 20 most diverse countries in Asia. The country's majority people are Kazakhs, while some ethnicities common to Russia form a significant minority at more than 20% of the population. Other significant ethnic minorities in the country include Uzbek, Ukrainian, Uhigur, Tatar, and German.\n\n14 - Malaysia\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 57%\n\nWith an ethnic fractionalization of 57%, Malaysia is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. The majority of its population consists of three ethnic groups, namely Malays, Chinese, and Indians. In addition, its Sabah state consists of 32 ethnic groups (as per the Malaysian government), with a major group being Kadazandusun.\n\n13 - Bahrain\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 58%\n\nBahrain is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. Around half of the people in the country are expatriate laborers, primarily from South Asia.\n\n12 - Oman\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 60%\n\nWith an ethnic fractionalization of 60%, Oman is the 12th most diverse country in Asia. While more than half of its population is Arab, the country has a large number of Baloch migrants from Iran and Pakistan. Other ethnicities in the country include Bengali, Persian, and Tamil people.\n\n11 - Laos\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 63%\n\nLaos is 11th on our list of the 20 most diverse countries in Asia. The Loas government officially recognizes 49 ethnic groups with 160 ethnic subgroups.\n\n10 - Bhutan\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 65%\n\nBhutan is one of the top 10 most diverse countries in Asia. 98% of its population is made up of Ngalong, Sharchop, Kheng, and Nepali speakers. Other ethnic groups that form a small minority in the country include Brokpa, Doya, Lepcha, and Tibetans.\n\n9 - United Arab Emirates\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 68%\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is the 9th most diverse country in Asia. Some of the major ethnic groups in the country include Emirati, South Asians, Egyptians, and Filipinos.\n\n8 - Qatar\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 71%\n\nQatar is 8th on our list of the most diverse countries in Asia. Arabs collectively make up 40% of the total population in the country. In addition, Qatar has a significant minority of Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Nepalis, and Sri Lankans, who together make up more than 50% of the population.\n\n7 - Iran\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 74%\n\nIran is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. While the predominant ethnic group in Iran consists of Persian-speaking people, they generally have a mixed ancestry. Some of the minorities in the country include Kurds and Balochs. A small percentage of Afghans also live in the country.\n\n6 - Pakistan\n\nEthnic Fractionalization - 75%\n\nWhile the most dominant ethnic group in Pakistan is Punjabi, the country has many other ethnicities as significant minorities. The country is an ethnic majority minority as more than half of its population is composed of ethnic minorities. Pashtun are the most significant ethnic minority followed by Sindhis, Saraiki, and Balochs. In addition, there are many subgroups within its ethnicities that regard themselves as ethnically distinct. Punjabis, for example, include Arains, Jats, and Rajputs, among others.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Most Diverse Countries in Asia.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Most Visited Countries in Europe 40 Least Visited Countries in the World 50 Most Popular Countries in the World in 2023\n\nDisclosure: none. 20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has made a lot of millionaires over the last year as its share price skyrocketed 225%. The company rallied investors as it became the poster child for a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), snapping up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, the chart above shows that Nvidia's meteoric rise has made it an expensive option compared to other tech stocks. Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are significantly higher than the same metrics for Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nForward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics as they consider a company's financial health alongside its share price.\n\nFor both, the lower the figure, the better the value. As a result, Intel and Apple are trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia.\n\nSo, forget Nvidia and consider these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel\n\nShares in Intel have risen more than 135% since it went public in 1971, creating plenty of millionaires along the way.\n\nHowever, the company has hit a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and the end of a partnership with Apple that lasted more than decade.\n\nIntel responded to recent headwinds by introducing significant structural changes that could pay off in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025. This would see it adopt a model similar to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, becoming a major provider of foundry capacity in North America and Europe.\n\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI, a market valued at about $200 billion last year and projected to hit nearly $2 trillion by 2030.\n\nIn December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi 3, a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to challenge similar offerings from market leader Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.\n\nIntel's forward P/E of 26 makes it one of the best-valued AI chip stocks right now, with Nvidia's at 35 and AMD's even higher at 45. As a result, the company's stock is a lower-risk way to invest in the AI chip industry and an excellent option to hold over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's stock has a long reputation for providing investors with consistent and significant gains. In fact, Warren Buffett's holdings company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated 43% of its portfolio to Apple. Meanwhile, the iPhone company's shares have soared 571% since Berkshire first invested in 2016.\n\nApple has made many millionaires in its time, and it's unlikely to stop as the company continues to dominate consumer tech and expand into budding sectors like AI.\n\nShares in Apple popped 4% on April 11, marking its best performance in almost a year. The rally came after a Bloomberg report revealed the company will overhaul its Mac computer lineup to center around AI capabilities.\n\nApple dominates consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories. Immense brand loyalty from consumers could see the company become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, allowing Apple to carve out a lucrative position in the market. As a result, news that future products will place a stronger focus on the generative technology is promising. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nMoreover, despite recent headwinds, Apple achieved $107 billion in free cash flow last year, significantly more than rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet. The figure indicates Apple has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\n\nWith significant cash resources, an expanding position in AI, and a comparatively low forward P/E, Apple's stock is worth considering over Nvidia right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says ‘we’re investing’ in Indonesia fresh off his pledge to spend more on Vietnam suppliers, continuing his Southeast Asia charm offensive",
        "content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is on the hunt for new places that can make Apple products. Just a few days ago, Apple pledged to increase investment in Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for its products. Cook then flew further south to Indonesia—and said Wednesday that he’s ready to “look at” the country’s manufacturing sector.\n\nAfter meeting Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo, commonly referred to as Jokowi, Cook said that Apple will consider investing in an Indonesia-based supply chain, citing the president’s “desire to see manufacturing in the country.”\n\n“The investment ability in Indonesia is endless. There’s a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing,” Cook told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specifics.\n\nNeither Apple nor its suppliers manufacture products in Indonesia. Apple also does not operate a store in the country.\n\nYet the company manages several developer academies to integrate Indonesian developers into the iOS ecosystem. On Wednesday, Apple said it would open its fourth academy on the island of Bali.\n\nAn Indonesian minister later added that the government asked the iPhone maker to open two more centers, including one in the country’s new capital on the island of Borneo, named Nusantara.\n\nIndonesia requires that smartphones sold in the country are made up of at least 35% local components by value; Apple’s phones satisfy the quota due to the company’s investment in local software development.\n\nJokowi, who will leave office later this year, tried to encourage investment in higher-value manufacturing during his tenure.\n\nIn particular, he tried to leverage the country’s large reserves of nickel, a key material used in stainless steel and electric batteries. Indonesia banned the export of raw nickel ore in early 2020, spurring Chinese and Korean refiners to invest in local refining capacity.\n\nChinese EV giant BYD will also invest $1.3 billion in an Indonesian factory, government officials said earlier this year.\n\nWhat are Apple's plans for Vietnam?\n\nCook’s Indonesia stopover follows a two-day stopover in Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for Apple and its suppliers.\n\nDuring his trip, Apple pledged to increase its spending on Vietnam-based suppliers. The company said it has spent $15.7 billion on the country’s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.\n\nApple and its suppliers already produce iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and MacBooks in the country. The company relies on 25 suppliers in Vietnam, up from 21 in 2020, according to Reuters.\n\nChina is Apple’s largest manufacturing hub, but the company is diversifying its supply chains following significant COVID-era disruptions to its China-based manufacturing. Lockdowns in Zhengzhou, home to Apple supplier Foxconn’s most important iPhone plant, significantly disrupted Apple’s 2022 smartphone production ahead of the holiday season.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to Vietnam, Apple is also expanding production in India. The company made 14% of its iPhones in the South Asian country last fiscal year, up from 7% during the preceding fiscal year, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nApple is also facing a slump in China sales due to renewed competition from domestic brands. Chinese competition helped knock Apple from its perch as the world’s top smartphone seller in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from research firm IDC.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Got $1,000? These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Still a Bargain",
        "content": "Investors have moved heavily into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last 18 months. The release of a vastly improved version of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 forced the shareholding public to rethink the power of AI, and some stocks experienced massive increases.\n\nHowever, the market did not treat all AI stocks equally, and some struggled because of the perception that they had or were going to fall behind. Some of these market perceptions were probably overly negative, creating an opportunity in three AI stocks, even for those with only a $1,000 investment budget. Let's take a look at why these three AI stocks are now a bargain.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), has long been synonymous with AI. Since it first began using machine learning to correct spelling in 2001, it has been a leader in the AI field. It also became an \"AI-first\" company in 2016, meaning that it integrated AI into all products from that point forward.\n\nStill, the release of an improved version of ChatGPT changed perceptions. Google Search competitor Microsoft's Bing began integrating ChatGPT into its search tool in 2023, leading investors to question whether Alphabet could maintain its lead in search. Additionally, the release of its competing product, Google Gemini, received mixed reviews.\n\nNonetheless, the company recently combined its AI research arms with Google DeepMind to consolidate its efforts. Moreover, it holds around $111 billion in liquidity. Hence, if it cannot innovate in the field, it can probably buy out a company that can. These resources should help the company stay competitive in the AI field.\n\nFurthermore, despite its \"struggles,\" its stock is up by almost 50% over the last year to just under $160 per share as of the time of this writing. Also, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27, it sells at a lower valuation than all of the \"Fab 4\" stocks (see chart below). With its valuation and tremendous optionality, the negative perceptions are likely a buying opportunity, not a harbinger of long-term decline for the company. GOOGL PE Ratio Chart\n\n2. Apple\n\nAlthough investors may not think about it, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is an AI company. It invests heavily in AI-related research, and product features such as the iPhone's Siri, FaceID, and its keyboard are a few examples of AI-driven functionality.\n\nHowever, Apple has not released a \"major\" new product in several years, and its fastest-growing segment in terms of revenue is Apple Services. That strategy may have led to the perception that Apple is becoming less competitive on the technology front.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Benzinga, Apple plans to release some generative AI tools in June. Additionally, even when accounting for unrealized gains and losses, it held around $173 billion in liquidity as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30). With such resources, it can likely find a way to compete in AI.\n\nAmid the pessimism, Apple stock lost value during 2024 and largely missed out on the AI-driven rally in 2023. But during that time, its P/E ratio fell to 28, making it cheaper than all of the Fab 4 stocks. If investors buy at today's price, around $175 per share at the time of this writing, they could earn significant returns as they see a clearer and more actionable generative AI strategy.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nIt is difficult to undercut Alibaba(NYSE: BABA) when it comes to cheap AI stocks. Alibaba's valuation has fallen to just 13 times earnings. It resembles Amazon by being the largest e-commerce company in China and also operating a cloud-infrastructure platform.\n\nHowever, it has become cheap for several reasons. Alibaba stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR), meaning Alibaba shareholders own shares in a proxy rather than the actual company. While that is a frequently used arrangement for international stocks, it becomes risky when relations with the company's government deteriorate.\n\nUnfortunately for American investors, tenuous U.S.-China relations led directly to a delisting threat in 2022 when the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) could not access the company's internal audits. While the U.S. and China resolved this issue, it reminded people of the risks of this stock.\n\nAdditionally, the issues have led to declines in the stock so severe that Alibaba stock is down from its initial public offering (IPO) 10 years ago and is going for around $70 per share at the time of this writing. BABA Chart\n\nStill, while Alibaba is risky, the stock price may mean that investors have gone too far in pricing in the risk. This could lead to a massive surge in the stock if conditions improve, a potential gain that could entice some investors into the stock despite its risks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

I think that, there is a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing. We believe in the country,” Cook said.\n\nThe previous day, Cook met Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, where he said Apple plans to invest more in Vietnam and increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub.\n\n“Given the slowing Chinese economy as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing efforts to squeeze out foreign companies and replace them with domestic brands, Apple wants alternatives for manufacturing,” said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University whose work focuses on technology and geopolitics.\n\n“It has already invested more in India and Vietnam, but it is likely looking at other partners in South East Asia to additional manufacturing and assembly operations,” Miller said.\n\nCook's visit to Indonesia came after Apple announced its fourth Apple Developer Academy in the country, to be located in Bali. The company first launched the program to train app developers in Indonesia in 2018, in the capital Jakarta.\n\nWidodo's government has sought to leverage the country's reserves of nickel and other raw materials to bring in manufacturing, banning export of raw commodities such as nickel and bauxite to oblige companies to build refineries domestically.\n\nIndonesia’s minister of communication and information, Budi Arie Setiadi, said Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would visit Indonesia at the end of April. ___\n\nAssociated Press writers Victoria Milko in Jakarta and Zen Soo in Hong Kong contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tim Cook says Apple wants to invest more in Vietnam as smartphone maker distances itself from China",
        "content": "Apple is doubling down on its Vietnam business. The smartphone maker wants to expand its business relationship with suppliers in Vietnam, according to reports from state media. Earlier this week Apple announced its plans to expand its supplier network in Vietnam during CEO Tim Cook's two-day visit to Vietnam.\n\nApple’s decision to build up its manufacturing in Vietnam coincides with a prolonged initiative from the iPhone maker to make its supply chain less reliant on China. A process that has been years in the making since the pandemic era supply chain disruptions caused numerous headaches for Apple. They culminated in 2022, when a factory belonging to one of Apple’s key suppliers, Foxconn, shutdown over a coronavirus outbreak during China’s zero-COVID policy and reports of bad labor conditions, which reportedly cost the company $1 billion a week. The factory’s closure led to a shortage of some 6 million iPhones, according to Bank of America.\n\nAfter that incident Apple began pushing to move its supply chain to other countries in the region.\n\nNow it seems to have earmarked Vietnam as one of the countries where it will ramp up operations. Apple already makes several products in Vietnam, including Airpods and Apple Watches. In December, Apple moved some iPad manufacturing from China to Vietnam. Some of Apple’s key suppliers, like Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, and Luxshare, which makes iPhones and the recently released Apple Vision Pro headset, have also been opting to bolster their supply chains in Vietnam. Since 2019, Apple has invested $16 billion in manufacturing capabilities in the country, according to state media.\n\nApple’s shift mirrors the U.S. as a whole, as the nation reevaluates its trade relationship with China over what it considers to be unfair business practices. While Cook was in Vietnam this week, President Joe Biden hosted other Asian leaders at the White House, promising closer ties amid rising geopolitical tensions across the world.\n\nTrade relations between the U.S. and China have become increasingly tense over the last year, and the resulting uncertainty has made the prospect of relying so heavily on China less palatable. Both countries have traded pointed public statements and implemented trade policies designed to hobble one another. The advent of AI combined with a global chip shortage led to a U.S. government ban on Chinese firms from accessing the most advanced semiconductor technology. More recently, the U.S. and other countries in Asia and Europe have accused China of oversupplying certain sectors of the market with cheap goods meant to undercut international competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this comes on a backdrop of declining sales for Apple in China. By mid-February iPhone sales in China were down 24% compared to the same time a year prior as Chinese smartphones eat away at Apple’s market share. In the first quarter of this year, iPhone shipments dropped 10%, as the Cupertino giant lost its spot as the number one smartphone in the world to Samsung.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) closed the latest trading day at $169.77, indicating a -1.69% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.03% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.41%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.12%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen a decrease of 0.59% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.55% and outstripping the S&P 500's loss of 0.9%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on May 2, 2024. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.50, showcasing a 1.32% downward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $90.25 billion, down 4.83% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $6.54 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, demonstrating changes of +6.69% and +0.58%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.07% lower within the past month. Right now, Apple possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Apple is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 26.39. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.98.\n\nInvestors should also note that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.08 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.08 at yesterday's closing price.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 244, this industry ranks in the bottom 4% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

Apple also said that it would increase its spending on suppliers, according to a press release on Monday.\n\n“There is no place like Vietnam, a vibrant and beautiful country,\" said Cook, according to the press release, adding that the company's annual spending in the country had doubled since 2019.\n\nNo details were shared about the plan. Cook arrived in Hanoi on Monday for a two-day visit during which he met students, programmers and content creators.\n\nApple began operating in Vietnam over a decade ago, and says it is responsible for creating over 200,000 jobs there. Vietnam is also among the top five leading mobile game producers globally.\n\nApple has 26 suppliers with 28 factories in Vietnam, according to its 2022 list. Most of these located in northern provinces, where they can be easily connected to existing supply chains in southern China. Northern Vietnam has also historically been a hub for making electronics and has cheap, skilled labor.\n\nView comments",

Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is one of the oldest stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and its fourth-largest holding, accounting for more than 6% of its stock portfolio.\n\nInvestors shouldn't look to Coca-Cola to have growth-stock-like revenue or profit growth, but the company has been consistent with its growth over the years. Coca-Cola's revenue for 2023 was $45.8 billion, up 6% year over year. Its revenue growth outpaced its global case volume (up 2% year over year), which points to the company's pricing power.\n\nCoca-Cola's brand in the beverage world is unrivaled, and the company does a good job of leveraging that when it experiences stagnant periods. Operating only in the beverage industry ensures Coca-Cola doesn't spread itself too thin and can focus on running its business as efficiently as possible. That's partly why Coca-Cola's net income is often higher than PepsiCo's, despite its revenue falling far below the snack and beverage company's. KO Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nThe main reason I'd argue for holding on to Coca-Cola's stock forever is its dividend. The company is a Dividend King, having increased its yearly dividend for 62 straight years, and there are no signs of that stopping. Only a handful of companies have a longer streak of yearly dividend increases.\n\nCoca-Cola's quarterly dividend is $0.485, with a trailing-12-month yield of around 3.2%. That's more than double the S&P 500's average and good enough to boost investors' total returns if the stock's price hits a stagnant period.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, accounting for close to 43% of its stock portfolio. A huge concentration in Apple stock has done wonders for Berkshire Hathaway over the years, but this year hasn't been the best for the iPhone maker. Apple stock is down close to 5% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of Apple's stock price struggles have been caused by investors worrying about the company's recent lack of growth. In the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (ended Dec. 30, 2023), Apple made $119.6 billion in revenue, but it was only up 2% year over year. This is continuing a worrying trend, too. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nDespite this trend, I believe some concerns about Apple are warranted yet overblown. The iPhone accounts for a large portion of Apple's revenue (surpassing 58%), and the slowdown in smartphone sales over the past few years has taken its toll. In October 2023, global smartphone sales grew 5% year over year, marking the first positive growth in 27 months leading up to that point. Investors shouldn't overlook that.\n\nSlow revenue growth aside, the company's services segment growth is a sign of optimism. Below is how product versus service revenue has played out over Apple's last five fiscal years:\n\nFiscal Year Product Revenue Percentage Services Revenue Percentage 2019 82% 18% 2020 80% 20% 2021 81% 19% 2022 80% 20% 2023 78% 22%\n\nData source: Apple.\n\nServices are higher-margin businesses than products and can provide Apple with more reliable income via subscriptions. Apple is smart to focus on building its services ecosystem to complement its hardware.\n\nApple definitely has some kinks to work out, but it has consistently shown that it's one of the world's greatest companies for a reason. Buffett famously said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful,\" and now seems to be a time when investors are fearful of Apple. Now seems like a great time for long-term investors to scoop up Apple shares.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Silicon Valley chip developer Rivos Inc. raised more than $250 million as it works toward bringing out its first product, underscoring the push for new hardware to meet the needs of artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Tells Iran Cooperation Will Last After Attack on Israel Beyond the Ivies: Surprise Winners in the List of Colleges With the Highest ROI US Two-Year Yield Eyes 5% Before Powell’s Remarks: Markets Wrap IMF Steps Up Its Warning to US Over Spending and Ballooning Debt Iran’s Conflict With Israel Puts US Ally Jordan on Edge\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company said Tuesday that Matrix Capital Management is the largest investor in the latest round, with new backers including Intel Capital and Taiwan chip design firm MediaTek Inc. participating.\n\nRivos is betting on demand from AI users that don’t need the costliest and most powerful chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. to run their services. The company targets customers using data analytics and generative AI, seeking to capitalize on the rising popularity of AI following the advent of ChatGPT.\n\n“We can target potentially smaller installations where Nvidia might seem like an overkill from a cost perspective,” Rivos co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Puneet Kumar said in an interview. “We can go in with a solution that works well enough and can compete quite well.”\n\nRivos’s chip uses the open-standard RISC-V, a design competing with Arm Holdings Plc, Kumar said. He declined to give details of its chip structure, timeline for product releases, or the startup’s valuation.\n\nThe company plans to use the fresh funds to pilot produce chips using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s 3NE process technology, among the most advanced in mass production. TSMC’s strategic partner VentureTech Alliance was an existing investor in Rivos and took part in the latest round, along with Walden Catalyst, Dell Technologies Capital, and Koch Disruptive Technologies.\n\nLip-Bu Tan, the founding chairman of Rivos and early backer, said RISC-V has strong long-term potential especially in data analytics and generative AI applications. Tan, the former chairman and CEO of chip design software company Cadence Design Systems Inc., has been an investor in several key chip startups sold to Amazon.com Inc., Qualcomm Inc., and Intel Corp. He is on the board of Intel.\n\nKumar was previously part of the team at P.A. Semi Inc., a chip design firm acquired by Apple Inc. as the iPhone maker started to make its own chips. He started Rivos in 2021. Apple sued Rivos in 2022, claiming trade secret theft. Rivos sued back, saying the tech giant forces employees to sign restrictive agreements that prevent them from working elsewhere, stifling up-and-coming companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, Apple said it reached an agreement to settle the case, paving the way for the new funding round.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Resilient Global Economy Masks Growing Debt and Inequality Cities Use AI to Help Ambulances and Firetrucks Arrive Faster Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation of Teenage Sextortion The Shadow Swiftie Economy Booms With Bootleg Bracelets and $1,150 Bodysuits How a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world. He built his fortune by investing in elite businesses with powerful competitive advantages and attractive long-term growth prospects.\n\nIf you are like many who think Buffett has the right ideas about stocks, you can invest alongside Buffett by buying shares of some of his favorite companies. He provides a regularly updated list of the stocks his company buys and sells.\n\nLet's take a closer look at three of the largest holdings in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), the investment conglomerate that Buffett has built up into an $870 billion financial fortress. All three stocks are still excellent buys today.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBuffett (through Berkshire) has a massive stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Berkshire owns roughly $160 billion worth of the tech titan's shares, which account for more than 40% of its $372 billion public stock portfolio.\n\nBuffett admires Apple's trusted brand, loyal customer base, and unrivaled profitability. He also appreciates how the iPhone maker's more than $100 billion in annual net income enables it to repurchase its own stock, which can boost earnings per share by reducing the amount of shares outstanding. In this way, Apple's hundreds of billions of dollars of stock buybacks help to increase the value of Berkshire's stake, along with those of its other shareholders. You could be one of those shareowners if you buy today.\n\nAdditionally, Buffett understands the value of the more than 2.2 billion Apple devices in use around the world. This enormous base of existing users provides Apple with ample opportunity to sell new devices and services. Products like the company's new Apple Vision Pro augmented reality headset are thus able to enjoy stronger initial demand and developer support than they otherwise would.\n\nIn fact, the tech titan's services segment has already blossomed into a high-margin, nearly $100 billion business. And it should continue to grow briskly, particularly as Apple unveils new artificial intelligence (AI) features as expected in the coming months.\n\n2. Coca-Cola\n\nBuffett has held shares in Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) for far longer than he has Apple (1988 versus 2016). The beverage giant accounts for about 6% of Berkshire's $372 billion portfolio, a stake now valued at a whopping $23 billion.\n\nCoca-Cola is attuned to consumers' shifting preferences. With more shoppers seeking healthier alternatives, the soda king has broadened its product lineup to include more wholesome fare like milk, vitamin-enhanced water, juices, and tea. Fairlife, Bodyarmor, Minute Maid, and Gold Peak now stand among Coca-Cola's stable of successful brands.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beverage titan's advertising expertise and vast distribution network enable it to quickly scale up new brands once it uncovers a hit product. Coca-Cola's innovation initiatives drove about a quarter of its gross profit growth in 2023.\n\nThe company's cost-cutting efforts are also boosting profits. Asset sales, such as management's decision to sell off the lion's share of Coca-Cola's lower-margin bottling facilities, contributed to its 13% earnings-per-share growth in 2023.\n\nThese profit gains enabled the dividend stalwart to increase its annual cash payout to investors for the 62nd consecutive year in February. Coca-Cola's shares are now yielding a solid 3.3%.\n\n3. Occidental Petroleum\n\nOne of Buffett's most recent big bets is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Berkshire has been an aggressive buyer of the oil and gas producer's shares since 2022. The investment colossus owns a 28% stake in Occidental valued at roughly $17 billion, as well as over $8 billion of preferred stock and warrants that give it the right to increase its holdings in the energy company.\n\nBerkshire helped to finance Occidental's purchase of Anadarko Petroleum back in 2019. The deal bolstered Occidental's assets in the Permian Basin and other oil- and gas-rich regions. The combined company's operations in the U.S. are now supplying reliable energy to its customers at a time when conflicts in the Middle East and Europe are disrupting international markets.\n\nBuffett is also intrigued by the energy producer's leading position within the potentially multitrillion-dollar market for carbon management services. CEO Vicki Hollub believes Occidental's talents in enhanced oil recovery, which uses carbon dioxide to release more oil from mature fields, will give it an edge in the bourgeoning industry of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).\n\nHollub intends to supply the technology that will allow its partners to build as many as 1,000 carbon capture plants around the world. Processes that can remove carbon dioxide from the air could serve an important role in battling climate change. ExxonMobil projects that the market for carbon capture solutions will reach a staggering $4 trillion by 2050. For her part, Hollub thinks Occidental will eventually generate more profits from its carbon management services than it does today from oil and gas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 1 Stocks to Watch. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 5 Stocks to Watch.\n\nWall Street analysts and wise investors often keep a close eye on insider buying and selling, since academic research has time and again proved that insiders often act as opportunists and make use of insider information while conducting insider transactions. This is especially true for insider purchases, as we have discussed the relevant academic research recently. But what about insider selling? While many believe insider selling is not predictive of anything substantial, there are a few angles in insider selling activity which should not be ignored as they might provide something of value for long-term investors.\n\nWhen Should You Pay Attention to Insider Selling?\n\nBen Silverman, director of research at Verity, in his podcast entitled Things All Investors Should Know About Insider Selling, said that there are certain kinds of insider selling activities which are worthy of investors’ attention. Silverman specifically advised investors not to overlook insider selling transactions conducted under the Rule 10b5-1, which allows insiders to sell their company shares by delineating a specific plan, which mentions stock price, amount and transaction date in advance. The analyst said that there has been a misconception in the industry that insider selling under the Rule 10b5-1 is of “vanilla nature” and does not show “opportunistic” tendencies of insiders. Silverman believes some insiders have been using this rule to “sell opportunistically” and some of them have been “very smart about it.”\n\nImportant Insider Selling of 2024: Mark Zuckerberg Selling Meta Platforms\n\nOne of the examples of such transactions, according to Silverman, is Mark Zuckerberg’s selling Meta Platforms shares under the rule. Zuckerberg started selling Meta Platforms shares last year. He kept selling the stock almost daily, following a pattern. But Silverman said the size of Zuckerberg’s selling increased significantly in February 2024 when the social media company’s shares jumped. Silverman said Meta Platforms co-founder had adopted the Rule 10b5-1 back in July 2023, and at that time he didn’t know at what price Meta shares would be trading in February at 2024.\n\n\"But he did have the foresight to prepare for it by setting up Rule 10b5-1 to accelerate selling at certain prices,\" Silverman added.\n\nHowever, Silverman did say that since companies offer special stock options annually to their executives, insiders usually do not need to worry about their company stock price while selling it. Silverman said insiders can often build up “enormous equity exposure” easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nSilverman’s point regarding insider selling is also backed by academic research. In a paper titled Insider Trading: Frequency Matters, researchers talked about how many insiders use informational advantage while selling shares under the Rule10b5-1. Here is an important excerpt from the study:\n\n\"One US example involves selling shares through preprogrammed 10b5-1 plans, a process that on its face might suggest an orderly series of sales over time, but in reality, is often designed to facilitate large sales at the first opportunity. There is evidence that 10b5-1 preprogrammed selling occurs disproportionately before negative earnings surprises (Jagolinzer, 2008) and can predict share price decline more than insider sales in general (Milian, 2016). Other studies find that selling insiders sometimes appear to work subtly with analysts around the timing of earnings revisions (Richardson, Teoh, & Wysocki, 2004), or otherwise massage earnings accrual information (Kraft, Lee, & Lopatta, 2014), or the timing of share repurchases (Bonaime & Ryngaert, 2013) and earnings restatements (Agrawal & Cooper, 2015) to support a stock price before a sale. There is also evidence that insiders sell well in advance of a default (Beneish, Press, & Vargas, 2012) or bankruptcy (Iqbal & Shetty, 2002), or alternatively, reduce selling ahead of receiving a takeover bid (Agrawal & Nasser, 2012). Not every subtle exit strategy involves selling; informationally motivated share disposal occurs through prepaid forward contracts (Jagolinzer, Matsunaga, & Young, 2007) and large charitable gifts (Yermack, 2009).\"\n\nWhich Sectors and Industries are Seeing Insider Selling in 2024?\n\nInsider Monkey’s analysis shows that since April 10 through April 15, insiders were dumping technology stocks since the sector had the heaviest concentration of insider selling activity in the period. In 2024, February saw the highest insider selling activity, with insiders dumping about $6.4 billion worth of shares in the month, according to data from CNBC.  Software and Services saw the heaviest insider selling recently, followed by Biotechnology and Gas, according to CNBC. Latest Insider Selling in April 2024: 10 Stocks to Watch\n\nInsider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\nFor this article we used Insider Monkey's insider trading screener to find stocks that saw heavy insider selling in April through April 8. From these companies we chose 10 stocks with the highest insider selling activity in terms of dollar value. Some top names in the list include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\n10. Starwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD) [Parent company: Starwood Capital Group]\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nStarwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD) ranks 10th in our list of the stocks insiders are selling these days. Barry S. Sternlicht, a director at Starwood Property Trust Inc (NYSE:STWD), on April 1 sold 973,000 shares of the REIT at $23.08 per share. In addition to Starwood, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) also saw insider selling in April.\n\n9. nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nFinancial technology solutions company nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO) shares have gained about 43% over the past one year. The stock recently saw insider selling activity as Insight Holdings Group, LLC., which has a director and 10% stake owner status at nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO), sold 1,031,659 company shares at $35.20 per share on April 1. Since then the stock is down 3.22%. Another director at nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO), Jeff Horing also sold 5.1 million shares of nCino Inc (NASDAQ:NCNO) at $35.20 per share on April 1.\n\nBaron Small Cap Fund stated the following regarding NCino, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCNO) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“This quarter we initiated a position in NCino, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCNO), a leading provider of cloud-based banking software that was founded in 2012. The company’s platform helps more than 1,850 global financial institutions modernize their processes around client onboarding and account opening, making loans, and managing loans after they have been originated. NCino’s solutions support a large majority of customers at a financial institution, including commercial, small business, consumer, and mortgage customers.\n\nNCino operates in a large market – the addressable market is approximately $10 billion in the Americas and $18.5 billion on a global basis – and has achieved high levels of customer satisfaction as evidenced by a strong net promoter score of 74 and very little voluntary churn. The company’s solutions are deeply embedded in customer workflows and generate a strong return on investment in the form higher revenue from more loans, lower costs from a reduction in paper-based processes, faster decision making, and improved efficiency with the ability to consolidate several legacy systems. Relative to the competition, nCino’s solution has several advantages, including operating a cloud-native single platform (built on top of Salesforce) that is free from legacy tech debt, having a well-known brand that is highly regarded in the marketplace (especially strong in commercial banking), and a long history of successful deployments with an impressive roster of customers (institutions like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Barclays, Fifth Third, and many others) who can then serve as reference accounts.\n\nNCino is well positioned to drive mid-teens or greater organic revenue growth for many years driven by a combination of growth with existing clients (even within its large U.S. customers, we estimate that nCino is only around mid-20% penetrated today), increasing penetration of nIQ (data analytics and machine learning products), continuing to win new commercial clients, gaining traction in newer end-markets like consumer loans and mortgages, and ramping its international expansion. The company is already seeing good success in the U.K., Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and several countries in continental Europe. The company has also started to ramp its margin profile, but we see a path for additional margin expansion from the low double-digit range today up to 30% to 35% operating margins over time. We believe there is a long runway for profitable growth for nCino, as banks and other financial institutions choose it as a partner to help digitize and transition to the cloud.”\n\n8. Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nAres Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks insiders are selling. On April 3, Ares Management Corp's (NYSE:ARES) co-founder and executive chairman of the board, Antony P. Ressler, sold 399,601 shares of Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) at $132.95 per share. Since April 3 the stock is up 1.65%.\n\n7. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 33\n\nPennsylvania-based biotechnology company Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDGL) is one of the stocks insiders are selling in April. On April 3,  Rebecca Taub, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MDGL) Chief Medical Officer, sold 73,888 shares of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDGL) at $243.92 per share. Since this transaction the stock is down 0.9%.\n\nIn addition to MDGL, insiders are also selling Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD).\n\n6.

Scannell, the President of Global Sales and Customer Operations at Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), dumped 106,483 Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) shares at $129.15 per share on April 3.

        "content": "Meta to Suspend Threads in Turkey Amid Regulatory Challenges, Aims for Future Reinstatement\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) has announced that it will cease operating Threads in Turkey starting Monday, April 29, in response to an interim order from the Turkish Competition Authority (TCA).\n\nThis decision will likely disappoint many Turkish users actively participating in the Threads community.\n\nMeta will notify all Turkish Threads users of this change through the app before the shutdown date to ease the transition.\n\nAlso Read:Meta Enhances Election Safeguards for 2024 To Tackle Misinformation\n\nUsers in Turkey can either deactivate their Threads profile, preserving the possibility of reactivating it if Threads returns, or delete their profile entirely.\n\nThose opting for deactivation can still access and download their posts using the Download Your Information tool.\n\nThe move came after the TCA issued an interim order that prevented data sharing between Threads and Instagram, a decision Meta disagreed with.\n\nThe company said it believes it complies with all Turkish legal standards and plans to appeal the order.\n\nDespite disagreeing with the TCA’s interim order, Meta temporarily suspended Threads’ operations in Turkey.\n\nMeta intends to maintain a constructive dialogue with the TCA and aims to reinstate Threads for its Turkish user base as soon as possible.\n\nMeta’s launch of Threads in the EU got delayed due to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which, as of July 2023, classified Meta along with other tech leaders like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as platform gatekeepers.\n\nMeta lowered the monthly fee for its ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe to 5.99 euros, down from the initial 9.99 euros. The fee adjustment responds to the DMA’s restrictions on Meta’s ad personalization capabilities, seeking a balance between complying with EU privacy regulations and the DMA.\n\nThis adjustment occurs amidst broader EU scrutiny of Big Tech’s dominance and privacy practices, with Meta contesting a fee to fund the enforcement of the new EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which demands enhanced content moderation from major online platforms.\n\nMeta stock gained 134% in the last 12 months.

Such firms design their hardware and chips, manufactured by foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor being the largest.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor makes roughly 90% of the world’s advanced chips. It is responsible for the cutting-edge, advanced AI chips that firms, including Nvidia, make.\n\nThe company made a bullish call on chip manufacturing demand early this year, forecasting 20% revenue growth. That call immediately spiked shares by more than 10%, and they have since risen by an additional 30%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor doesn’t command the impressive multiples that Nvidia does, but analysts believe it can continue growing at its present price.\n\nMicron (MU) Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a table\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron (NASDAQ:MU) suffered more than almost any other chip stock throughout the past few years. Pandemic chip shortages hit the specialized memory chip manufacturers particularly hard. Firms over-ordered Micron chips, a supply glut caused demand for those chips to crater, and the company suffered huge operating losses in 2023.\n\nMicron generated operating losses for the first time in over a decade in 2023. Then, suddenly, the fortunes of the company changed.\n\nThe company’s specialized high bandwidth memory (HBM) is in high demand. It has applications for the artificial intelligence chips that firms demand. It also began producing HBM, which will be used in Nvidia’s H200 chips.\n\nThe company’s HBM products remain in high demand. Most of its 2025 capacity is already booked. HBM allows artificial intelligence chips to perform better, so investors should keep their eye on MU shares. Demand is sky-high, which can still push share prices higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the very best positioned chip stocks available to investors today. It is, of course, the primary challenger of Nvidia’s dominance. It has emerged as such a potent competitor because Its chips are nearly as powerful as those from Nvidia yet cost a fraction of the price.\n\nThus, AMD represents the best bang for your buck in the AI chip landscape. Are enterprises willing to risk investing in AMD chips over Nvidia’s? Leading chip purchasers, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI have each announced plans to use AMD’s MI300X AI platform.\n\nHowever, the answer is not that simple. AMD’s newest platform boasts better specifications than Nvidia’s H100 platform. Nvidia is releasing its H200 platform soon. Comparison is, therefore, muddled. Further, Nvidia has stronger software, which is particularly important in AI applications.\n\nOverall, AMD has a chance to compete with Nvidia, although it is not a clear-cut case. It’s why investors should continue to bet on AMD.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is another integral link in the advanced chip manufacturing supply chain. The company monopolizes advanced lithography machines used to make the most advanced chips. Essentially, no other firm can replicate the products it produces, giving it a near monopoly.\n\nA lot has been said about those extreme ultraviolet lithography machines it produces and their importance overall. While that is integral to its story, let’s look at another less covered factor.\n\nASML has been identified as one of 18 European equivalents to the U.S. Magnificent 7 stocks. UBS (NYSE:UBS) handpicked the Dutch company as one with the potential to outperform significantly. It should be a relatively easy choice for American investors, given that ASML is a tech firm. It is, therefore, very similar to the Magnificent 7, which relies heavily on technology.\n\nAI demand is going to continue to grow. That means ASML’s EUV machines will continue to be in high demand as the cutting edge fabrication machines that they are.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has performed well this year, rising from $140 to $175. That strong performance is paradoxical because the company’s fortunes are generally tied to phone sales.\n\nDemand for expensive handsets is lagging currently. Consumers continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are more hesitant to purchase phones that can easily cost north of $1,000. Qualcomm is a major supplier of cell phone chips, and thus, should struggle.\n\nHowever, Qualcomm is not. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Gen 8 and Snapdragon Gen 8S chips drive the generative AI on the phone market. The company is iterating its generative AI features down throughout the price range of cell phones. Those chips were first applicable to high-end models and, in time, will bring generative AI capability to lower and lower-range models. It is easy, then, to see why QCOM stock makes so much sense at this time: People spend increasingly more time on their phones and AI opportunities therein are massive.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), like Qualcomm, is a reliable stock choice for chip stocks investors. Both firms include dividends that signal overall reliability. That isn’t the primary reason for considering investing in Broadcom, but I wanted to mention it.\n\nThe bigger and more important reason is that Broadcom is an integral chip firm and part of the overall AI opportunity. The company develops infrastructure software solutions for semiconductors. Basically, Broadcom helps chip firms derive greater AI output from the same quantity of power.\n\nThe company is also thriving fundamentally. During the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 34%, reaching $11.96 billion. The company repurchased 7.7 million shares of stock and eliminated them. Broadcom is also known to hike its dividends annually.\n\nAVGO Stock is an excellent choice for more conservative investors looking to exploit the AI boom. While Broadcom doesn’t benefit from outsized valuation multiples like Nvidia, its impressive growth is very attractive.\n\nSkyworks (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a chip supplier that derives a significant portion of its sales from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nIt is similar to Qualcomm, an integral chip supplier to the iPhone maker. Like Qualcomm, Skyworks stock currently includes a dividend yielding 2.6%.\n\nThe application of generative AI to handsets is still nascent. That’s arguably the best reason to consider Skyworks at the moment. It derives a significant portion of its sales from cell phones. As that market grows, so should company-wide opportunities. Skyworks is positioned to grow with that emerging market.\n\nInvestors should also note that there are potential pitfalls despite Skyworks’ overall strength.  Apple continually makes efforts to bring chip production in-house. Qualcomm has served as an excellent example of that truth.  The risk that Apple walks away is one that the company continually has to navigate.\n\nYet, Qualcomm has proven that it is difficult for Apple to do so. Thus, the overall opportunity for Skyworks seems to be strong.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Stellantis is renaming its new Milano sports utility vehicle as the Junior.\n\nThe change came after Adolfo Urso, Italy’s industry minister, said on Thursday:\n\nA car called Milano cannot be produced in Poland. This is forbidden by Italian law … This law stipulates that you cannot give indications that mislead consumers. So a car called Milano must be produced in Italy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Alfa Romeo’s boss, Jean-Philippe Imparato, said today:\n\nWe decided to change the name, even though we know that we are not required to do so, because we want to preserve the positive emotion that our products have always generated and avoid any type of controversy.\n\n05:44 PM BST\n\nWave of retirement is starving UK stocks of pension fund investment, warns Goldman Sachs\n\nBritish businesses risk being starved of investment as pension funds sell off assets to meet a wave of retirement claims, Goldman Sachs has warned. Tim Wallace has the details:\n\nAnalysts at the Wall Street bank have sounded the alarm over investment levels flatlining in the UK after research found final salary schemes are selling almost as many British stocks as other pension funds are buying.\n\nThis has meant that UK-listed companies are receiving just £500m in net investment from pension funds each year.\n\nGoldman Sachs said defined benefit (DB) schemes – which pay a fixed income but are largely closed to new savers – are selling £2.5bn of shares per quarter to pay out pensions to retirees.\n\nAt the same time, defined contribution (DC) pensions – which do not guarantee a specific income but depend on the performance of financial markets – are buying £3bn of equities over the same period.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of this net investment is being ploughed into foreign stock markets, with only a quarter being diverted to British stocks.\n\nIn the 1990s, final salary schemes owned half of all UK shares, Goldman Sachs said.\n\nBy comparison, they now hold just 3pc after years of transferring funds to bonds, property and other assets deemed to be lower-risk.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n05:28 PM BST\n\nSuperdry to push for big rent cuts in restructuring\n\nSuperdry is to push for steep cuts in the rents it pays as it struggles to shore up its shaky finances.\n\nSky News has reported that the fashion retailer is planning to publish a formal restructuring plan this week focused on cutting rents. It is understood that it is not planning to close any shops but that landlords could terminate the leases if they are unhappy with the plan.\n\nSuperdry shares dropped nearly 6pc this afternoon on the news. They have lost more than 90pc of their value over the past year.\n\nSuperdry’s most recently filed accounts reported a loss of £148.1m on revenues of £622.5m.\n\nSuperdry said it “confirms it is in the advanced stages of preparing a restructuring plan which is expected to launch in the coming days. However, there is no certainty that such a restructuring plan will be implemented”.

Eir Nolsøe has more:\n\nThe FTSE 250-listed company on Monday confirmed it had cut 100 jobs since the start of the year, taking the total reduction in its staffing numbers over the past 12 months to 900.\n\nHiring remained muted in the UK, the US and Asia, while it deteriorated further in Continental Europe. The recruiter blamed the slump on bosses and candidates being anxious about taking risks.\n\nNicholas Kirk, chief executive of PageGroup, said: “Candidate and client sentiment remains subdued reflecting the general macroeconomic uncertainty in most of our markets.”\n\n60 jobs were axed in the UK, with profits at its British division plunging by nearly a fifth over the past year to £27.1m.\n\nAfter a heated war for talent coming out of the pandemic, job listings in the UK have fallen significantly over the last year and unemployment has edged up. It has coincided with a rapid rise in interest rates to their highest level in 16 years.\n\nThe UK fell into recession at the end of 2023, though economists believe it is likely to have been a short and shallow downturn.\n\nWhile the hiring downturn is bad news for recruiters, policymakers at the Bank of England are likely to feel pleased.\n\nThe Bank’s rate-setters are closely studying wage growth to judge when they can start bringing down interest rates from a 16-year-high of 5.25pc.

Revolut declined to comment on the valuation.\n\nYet it signals an easing of investor concerns about valuations in the sector after a year when multiple start-ups suffered write-downs and share prices among listed companies fell sharply.\n\nNear-zero interest rates caused valuations to balloon as easy access to capital fuelled investments in financial technology businesses. However, investors later grew cold on the sector as rising interest rates weighed on the availability of venture capital funding.

He said:\n\nWe estimate that oil prices already reflect a $5-to-$10-a-barrel risk premium from downside risks to supply.\n\nThe potential Israeli response to Iran’s attack is highly uncertain and will likely determine the extent of threat to regional oil supply.\n\nHe added that Iranian crude production has risen by more than 20pc over the past two years to 3.4m barrels a day, or about 3.3pc of global supply.\n\n“If the market were to price a higher probability of reduced Iran supply, then this could contribute to a higher geopolitical risk premium,” he added.\n\n07:37 AM BST\n\nOil prices could hit $100 if Israel-Iran conflict escalates, warns City\n\nOil prices could surge above $100 a barrel - a level which could raise petrol prices for drivers - if the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, City analysts have warned.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, has slipped below $90, having initially risen to $91.05 a barrel after Tehran launched drone strikes late on Saturday.\n\nOil prices climbed close to six-week highs last week as markets prepared for a potential retaliation by Iran to a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy in Syria earlier this month.\n\nAnalysts at Citi warned that its base case for the near future is for tensions to remain “extremely high” in the Middle East.\n\nAnalyst Max Layton wrote in a note to clients: “What is not priced into the current market, in our view, is a potential continuation of a direct conflict between Iran and Israel, which we estimate could see oil prices trade up to +$100/bbl, depending on the nature of the events.”\n\nA rise in prices to more than $100 a barrel would risk raising petrol prices for drivers.\n\nRAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “If the price of oil was to reach $95 a barrel, we could see petrol at the pump go back up to 150p a litre which would be bad news for hard-pressed drivers.”\n\n07:28 AM BST\n\nJapan stocks slump amid Middle East tensions\n\nTokyo stocks closed lower after Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone strikes on Israel raised fears of wider conflict in the region.\n\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 0.7pc, or 290.75 points, to end at 39,232.80, while the broader Topix index gave up 0.2pc, or 6.44 points, to 2,753.20.\n\n07:26 AM BST\n\nInchcape to sell UK car dealerships to US rival\n\nIn corporate news, car dealership firm Inchcape is to sell its UK retail operations for around £346m.\n\nThe company said it has sealed a deal to sell the operation, which employs 3,600 people across more than 80 sites, to US-based rival Group 1 Automotive.\n\nIt comes after London-listed Inchcape said it was reviewing options for the UK business, including a possible sale, after “approaches from a number of interested parties”.\n\nDuncan Tait, group chief executive of Inchcape, said:\n\nWith our active international expansion into higher value distribution activities, the strategic importance of the UK retail operations has become limited.\n\nThe board has therefore concluded it is the right time for a new owner to take this business forward.\n\n07:21 AM BST\n\nGold near record high after Iran attack on Israel\n\nGold prices rose as traders sought safe havens after Iran’s retaliatory attack on Israel stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe flight to safety sent gold up more than 0.5pc to $2,356.39 an ounce, close to its record high of $2,369.32.\n\n07:17 AM BST\n\nCameron: It’s right for Israel not to escalate\n\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron said “it is right for Israel not to escalate” after Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nHe told Times Radio:\n\nIsrael has every right to respond as an independent sovereign country being attacked in this way.\n\nBut I think we’re very anxious to avoid escalation and to say to our friends in Israel it’s a time to think with with head as well as heart.\n\nAnd in many ways this is a double defeat for Iran. Not only was their attack an almost total failure, but also the rest of the world can now see what a malign influence they are in the region and understand their true nature.\n\nAnd so I think it is right for Israel not to escalate, but obviously they’re a sovereign, independent country and they’ll make their own decisions.\n\n07:15 AM BST\n\nOil falls despite rising tensions in the Middle East\n\nOil prices have fallen despite the increasing tensions in the Middle East following Iran’s unprecedented attack on Israel.\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, has slipped 39 cents but remains above $90, having initially risen to $91.05 a barrel after Tehran launched drone strikes late on Saturday.\n\nOil prices climbed close to six-week highs last week as markets prepared for a potential retaliation by Iran to a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy in Syria earlier this month.\n\nThe attack over the weekend marked the first time Iran had ever launched a military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said: “While the drone attack has grabbed headlines, its immediate impact on global markets, particularly oil prices and inflation concerns, may be subdued.\n\n“The precision and limited lethal impact of Iran’s response suggest a strategic approach aimed at minimising damage rather than escalating tensions.”\n\nThe limited reaction of oil prices to Iran’s assault comes as markets had a little over a week to adjust to the potential for rising tensions in the Middle East - and amid diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflict.\n\nIran said its attacks were in response to a suspected Israeli strike on its Syrian embassy which took place on April 1.\n\nUS President Joe Biden was reported to have cautioned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “take the win” and forego a counterattack.\n\nExperts said the limited scope of the attack showed Iran was seeking to make a show of strength with its attack, but without sparking a conflict.\n\nHebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets, said:\n\nThe muted market response likely stems from the highly intricate sentiment in the market at this stage.\n\nMarket participants are certainly not giving up hope that the past weekend’s events were just a one-off occurrence, while holding their breath for what could happen next.\n\nHelima Croft at RBC Capital Markets said: “This war may move down the escalation ladder if the Israeli government follows the advice of the White House and forgoes retaliatory action.”\n\n07:07 AM BST\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Collects $2.1 Billion in Dividends Every Year From These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "It’s no secret Warren Buffett loves companies that pay dividends. While he refuses to allow Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) to pay any to shareholders, he enjoys collecting those checks from the businesses he owns.\n\nBuffett believes he can deliver superior returns for his shareholders if he allows them to make decisions for themselves. He’s probably right. Since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 1964, he has generated overall returns of 4,384,748% by the end of 2023. In contrast, the S&P 500 achieved over 31,000% returns. That means Buffett’s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% beat the benchmark index by nearly two-to-one. Most investors will have a tough time doing that in one year. Buffett’s done it for 60 years!\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha collected around $6 billion in dividends last year. That’s without doing anything but holding onto the shares of companies he already owns. But that’s only from his publicly traded stocks. In Buffett’s 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he revealed that his wholly owned railroad, BNSF, paid him $41.8 billion in dividends since it was acquired in 2010.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, which are Buffett’s best dividend stocks? Based on the amount collected, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will generate nearly $1 billion in dividends this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will deliver another $860 million. Yet I’m looking for the top stocks, so I wanted dividends that yielded at least twice the average yield of the S&P 500’s 1.4% yield. BAC stock just missed the cut at 2.7%, while AAPL pays a miserly 0.5%.\n\nThe following three Warren Buffett dividend stocks yield over 3% each and, in return, will mail Oracle $2.1 billion in checks this year.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPackaged food stock Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is the seventh largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett owns 325.6 million shares worth $11.8 billion. With a yield of 4.4%, it is the highest-yielding stock in the portfolio, which is set to deliver $520.5 million in dividends.\n\nThat’s not too shabby for a stock Buffett to consider a mistake. His holdings are the result of Buffett helping private equity firm 3G Capital Management to take control of H.J. Heinz in 2013 and then helping engineer the ketchup maker’s acquisition of Kraft Foods two years later. While Buffett believes the Heinz deal was good, he feels he “overpaid” for Kraft.\n\nSince acquiring Heinz, Buffett’s total return on the stock has been less than 18% compared to a 344% return by the S&P 500. The company owns a portfolio of top name brands like Kraft and Heinz and Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Maxwell House coffee. Half a million dollars a year in dividends can soften the blow of paltry returns and Buffett says he will never sell KHC stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nIt’s likely no surprise Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is on the list since it’s been known for years as a cash-producing machine. Buffett famously bought the beverage giant’s stock after Coca-Cola sent him a can of Cherry Coke in the 1980s. He ended up selling out of his Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) holdings and today owns 400 million shares of Coke worth $23.5 billion. That’s a 9.3% share of the company, accounting for over 6% of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nKO stock yields 3.3%, so Buffett will receive dividend checks this year amounting to $775.6 million from the soda king. Of course, Coca-Cola is much more than just a soda jerk today; it has a broad swath of the beverage market, including water, tea, juices and energy drinks.\n\nAlthough Buffett doesn’t really buy and sell the company’s shares anymore, preferring to just hold for the long term, Coke tends to be an all-weather stock. Cans of soda and other beverages are indulgences consumers will enjoy regardless of economic conditions. This is why it continues to thrive, and Buffett will likely never sell his holdings.\n\nChevron (CVX) Here's Why Investors Should be Bullish on Chevron Stock at Current Levels\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe brightest dividend star in Berkshire Hathaway has to be oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Buffett owns over 126 million shares valued at $20.5 billion. That puts the oil stock fifth in the portfolio.\n\nBuffett was selling shares of the energy company last year as he scooped up more shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) because of its position in the Permian basin. But in last year’s fourth quarter, he became a buyer again. Chevron is also a giant in the oil-rich Permian and its pending acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES) will give it access to the lucrative Guyana market (that is, if Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) doesn’t muck it up).\n\nWith CVX stock yielding 4% a year, Buffett stands to receive $822 million in dividends this year. This will be an income stream that goes on for years and years as fossil fuel demand continues to grow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in KO, XOM and CVX stock.

        "title": "Global iPhone shipments drop nearly 10% as Apple's 2024 woes continue",
        "content": "Global shipments of Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone fell nearly 10% in the first quarter despite a broader smartphone market recovery as the company continues to contend with rising challengers from China such as Xiaomi.\n\nAccording to market intelligence firm IDC, Apple’s Q1 shipments fell 9.6% year over year from 55.4 million units in the first quarter of 2023 to 50.1 million units in Q1 this year. The company’s overall global market share also slipped from 20.7% to 17.3%.\n\nShares of Apple were off by less than 1% Monday morning.\n\nApple wasn’t the only company to face headwinds in the quarter. Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, also saw shipments decline, though by just 0.7%.\n\n\"The smartphone market is emerging from the turbulence of the last two years both stronger and changed,\" IDC research director Nabila Popal said in a statement.\n\n\"Firstly, we continue to see growth in value and average selling prices (ASPs) as consumers opt for more expensive devices knowing they will hold onto their devices longer. Secondly, there is a shift in power among the Top 5 companies, which will likely continue as market players adjust their strategies in a post-recovery world.”\n\nWhile Apple is still the second largest smartphone maker in the world by shipment volume behind Samsung, Chinese firms like Xiaomi and Transsion are gaining momentum in the market. Xiaomi saw shipments rise 33.8% in the quarter to 40.8 million units, while Transsion shipments increased 84.9% to 28.5 million units.\n\nApple’s China business has been a thorn in the company’s side over the last two quarters. iPhone revenue fell 13% in the first quarter of the year and is expected to drop again when the company reports its Q2 earnings on May 2.\n\nChina is Apple’s third-largest market behind the Americas and Europe, making the region especially important for the company’s success. The iPhone 15 Pro phones are shown during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China are also adding to Apple’s difficulties. According to Bloomberg, Chinese officials are increasingly telling workers not to use iPhones or other foreign-made phones in the office.\n\nApple is also working to wean itself off China as its main manufacturing hub. The company is increasingly looking toward Vietnam and India to take on a larger portion of its manufacturing capabilities. CEO Tim Cook posted a series of photos of himself in Vietnam on Monday to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nApple is facing a series of challenges ranging from declining iPad and Wearables sales to the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit claiming that Apple purposely works to harm competition in the smartphone space. The European Union’s European Commission also hit the company with a $2 billion fine related to antitrust concerns about streaming music. The tech giant is also facing a potential $1 billion lawsuit in the UK related to fees it charges developers that sell apps through the App Store.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple shares have taken a beating so far this year, with the stock falling more than 8% since January. Shares of the company are up just 6% over the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 is up more than 20%.\n\nBut things could start to turn around for the company in the latter half of the year. Apple is widely expected to announce some form of generative AI-based capabilities during its WWDC developer conference in June. If Apple implements the technology in a new and interesting way, it could provide a boost to iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nStill, it’s unclear exactly what Apple will have on offer when it comes to generative AI, and there’s no guarantee it will be a massive success. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have already started introducing the technology on their smartphones, but it’s largely meant for manipulating photos and quick translation.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Why Baidu Stock Is a Real Bargain at It Current Levels",
        "content": "Chinese tech giant Baidu stock (NASADAQ:BIDU) is growing significantly while its profitability is rapidly increasing. Moreover, the firm is a leader in both artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles. Over the long term, these businesses should cumulatively tremendously boost Baidu’s top and bottom lines, lighting a fire under Baidu stock. Also importantly is that, given the company’s impressive financial results and strong outlook, the valuation of the shares is extremely low.\n\nBaidu owns and operates China’s leading internet search engine. The latter business currently generates most of its revenue and profits.\n\nImpressive Q4 Results\n\nBaidu’s revenue jumped 9% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier to $19 billion, while its net income, excluding certain items, soared 39% year-over-year to $1.09 billion. Also noteworthy is that the adjusted net income of its core business advanced a very strong 53% YOY to $1.06 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe result show that Baidu’s search engine business is performing quite well, growing quickly, and becoming significantly more profitable.\n\nBaidu Is a Leader in AI\n\nBaidu’s AI bot, Ernie, had over 100 million users as of the end of last year, and well-respected U.S. research firm IDC has reported that Ernie is better than any competing product in China when it comes to “algorithms, industry coverage, development tools and ecosystem,” Barron’s reported last October. As a result, Baidu’s contention that Ernie is on par with a leading American AI chatbot, ChatGPT, has some credibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Baidu’s prowess in AI should drive up the top and bottom lines of its cloud business. That phenomenon may already appears to be occurring as Baidu stock reported that its “non-online marketing revenue” climbed 9% YOY to $1.17 billion in Q4, with the increase being “mainly driven by (its) AI Cloud business.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that Citron Research in February wrote that Baidu could be “the most underappreciated name in AI,” while Bank of America is also upbeat on the firm’s AI capabilities and wrote that the technology should start moving the needle for Baidu stock in 2024.\n\nThere are reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may began using Baidu’s AI on its products in China. Although such a deal is not supposed to include significant payments by Apple to Baidu, such an agreement would likely greatly boost the reputation and credibility of Baidu’s AI offerings, making them much more popular.\n\nAs a result, such a collaboration between Apple and Baidu would likely indirectly generate a meaningful increase in Baidu’s revenue and profit, leading to significant gains by Baidu stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu’s Autonomous Vehicle Business Has Tremendous Potential\n\nOn the driverless vehicle front, Baidu provided roughly 839,000 rides in Q4, representing an impressive 49% YOY surge. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, 45% of the rides provided were “fully autonomous,” i.e. nearly half of the rides there did not include a safety driver. Moreover, last month Baidu began providing “24/7 autonomous driving service in selected areas of Wuhan.” As a result, BIDU became the first company in China to offer such a service.\n\nOver the longer term, I’m confident that this business will generate needle-moving revenue and profits for Baidu and Baidu stock. In addition to greatly expanding the number of robotaxi rides that it offers, Baidu can start charging much more for each ride as consumers become more comfortable with using autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the firm can license its driverless technology to automakers and truck operators for use in their vehicles.\n\nThe Valuation of Baidu Stock Is Extremely Attractive\n\nDespite all of Baidu’s strong, positive catalysts, its impressive growth and rapidly increasng profits, its forward price-earnings ratio is just 9.8 times, while its enterprise value/revenue ratio is a bargain-basement 0.18 times. There’s no doubt that BIDU represents a real bargain at its current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "10 Best Low Volatility ETFs To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best low volatility ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on low volatility investments, head over to 5 Best Low Volatility ETFs To Buy.\n\nWhat is Low Volatility Investing?\n\nLow volatility investing refers to an investment strategy where a stock portfolio is less volatile in terms of price fluctuations compared to the broader market, offering a smoother investment experience. Rather than choosing only low-risk stocks, this strategy measures how stocks move relative to each other. The main objective of low volatility investment strategies is to lower overall portfolio risk. The best way to benefit from low volatility investments is to invest in minimum volatility ETFs, which serve as strategic investment vehicles with long-term asset allocation, allowing investors to mitigate risk successfully. Historically, minimum volatility indexes have indicated reduced volatility compared to broader market indices.\n\nBetting against sudden changes in currency values has become very profitable in the financial world. Many big firms on Wall Street are seeing that their clients are no longer making bets against the market and believe that markets will remain stable. This is a big change in the market where currencies are traded, which is worth a whopping $7.5 trillion-a-day. The ups and downs in currency values that traders used to make money from are mostly gone now, as computer programs make bets that markets will stay calm. This is making lots of money for those anticipating minimal market swings. Henry Drysdale, head of currency options trading at NatWest Markets in London, toldBloomberg:\n\n“The emergence and dominance of systematic volatility selling funds is a bit self-fulfilling. If the strategy is successful, more enter the space and it gets quite crowded, with more and more participants selling volatility at lower and lower levels.”\n\nSimilarly, traders are making bets that raw materials prices will remain stable, going against the historical pattern of sharp ups and downs in the commodity sector. Different factors have contributed to the stagnation of commodity prices in recent months. For example, the oil market has been constrained by OPEC+ production cuts and ample spare capacity, while copper prices are influenced by growing demand from renewable energy sources alongside challenges in traditional consumption sectors. Gas volatility has returned to pre-crisis levels in Europe. This trend reflects a broader pattern in global markets, where investors are betting against significant price swings. With equity markets trending upwards and substantial investments pouring into ETFs focused on maintaining market stability, macro-level volatility has decreased. According to Jo Harmendjian, portfolio manager at Tiberius Group AG:\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s clear that we’re not in a momentum year for commodities at least. The only thing that can make you money is to find structures that can make money if nothing happens, a carry trade generated by selling vol wisely.”\n\nIn January this year, Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, said that she believes investing in individual stocks is not advisable for beginners, as they pose significant risks to portfolios. Instead, she recommends young investors focus on constructing diversified portfolios using low-cost mutual funds and ETFs. Amateur investors often lack the necessary research skills to select stocks wisely, relying instead on familiarity with well-known companies. This approach leaves them vulnerable to notable losses if these stocks underperform. Benz pointed out the recent market trends, where overzealous investors drove up prices of speculative stocks, only to see them nosedive later. To mitigate such risks, she advised spreading investments across a broad market index using index funds or ETFs. Benz toldCNBC:\n\n“If there’s a single investment type where there is a lot of data to support that, where you’ll have a good outcome, it’s using broad market index funds.”\n\nSome of the best low volatility ETFs to buy include Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF (NYSE:FDLO), SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (NYSE:ONEV), and iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (BATS:USMV), which expose investors to stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cencora, Inc. (NYSE:COR), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best low volatility ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”\n\n8.

        "content": "iphones\n\nApple has lost its spot as the world’s top smartphone maker by sales as Chinese rivals eat into its market share.\n\niPhone sales dropped by 9.6pc in the first three months of the year to around 50 million, analysts at IDC said, while volumes shipped by Chinese challengers surged.\n\nBeijing-headquartered rival Xiaomi increased its phone shipments by 33.8pc and budget Chinese technology brand Transsion grew its sales by 84pc.\n\nApple’s market share fell to 17.3pc in the first three months of 2024 as a result, compared to 20.7pc a year earlier.\n\nRyan Reith, vice president at IDC, said a “resurgence of Huawei in China” and “notable gains from Xiaomi” were increasingly challenging Apple and its major rival Samsung.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSouth Korea’s Samsung is faring better than Apple and claimed the top spot as the world’s most popular smartphone brand by sales, IDC said.\n\nNabila Popal, research director at IDC, said: “While the top two players both saw negative growth in the first quarter, it seems Samsung is in a stronger position overall than they were in recent quarters.”\n\nOver the past decade, Samsung has consistently held the top spot as the world’s biggest seller of smartphones. However, Apple surpassed its rival in late 2023 after the release of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, its latest flagship handsets.\n\nApple’s shares have dipped 5pc so far this year amid market concerns that demand for its iPhones is waning.\n\nThe tech giant has been searching for its next big technology breakthrough, launching the Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset in February. It is also planning to add new artificial intelligence features to its next line-up of MacBooks and iPhones.\n\nCompetition is getting more intense in the smartphone market as sales decline.\n\nThe global smartphone market shrank in 2023 as rising interest rates eroded consumers’ ability to splash out on the latest gadgets. Shipments of phones dropped 4pc compared to 2022, according to data from Canalys.\n\nHowever, IDC said the wider market appeared to be showing signs of rebounding. Smartphone sales climbed 7.8pc to 289.4 million in the first three months of 2024, the analysts said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeparately on Monday, Samsung agreed to produce its latest generation of semiconductors in the US, securing $6.4bn (£5.1bn) in subsidies from the White House under Joe Biden’s Chips Act.\n\nSamsung will ramp up a new microchip manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, as part of a $40bn spending spree in the US.\n\nThe US has been spending billions of pounds to attract foreign chipmakers to America in a bid to reinforce its domestic technology supply chain. It comes amid fears China could one day invade Taiwan, which dominates global microchip production.",

The AI market hit close to $200 billion last year and is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.\n\nSo now is an excellent time to dedicate a larger portion of your portfolio to tech and potentially enjoy big gains in the coming years as AI expands and touches more areas of the industry.\n\nHere are two hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been a figure in tech since its founding 55 years ago. As a leading chipmaker, the company has supplied its hardware to all areas of the industry, including custom-built gaming PCs, Microsoft's Windows computers, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Mac lineup, cloud platforms, and more.\n\nBut Intel has faced repeated challenges in recent years. Its stock is down about 48% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple.\n\nAs a result, the company has made major structural changes to its business model that could pay off in 2024 and beyond. Last June, Intel announced a \"fundamental shift\" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025. This change would see it adopt a model similar to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, becoming a major provider of foundry capacity in North America and Europe.\n\nMoreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a graphics processing unit (GPU) designed to challenge similar offerings from market leader Nvidia. The company also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently. AMD PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nChip stocks are some of the best ways to invest in tech. With nearly all areas of the industry increasingly requiring more powerful hardware, demand is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. And the chart above shows Intel is one of the best-valued chip stocks.\n\nIt has the lowest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio compared to its two biggest rivals, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. With promising changes to its business model and an expanding position in AI, Intel's stock is a no-brainer this year.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nIt hasn't been easy to be an Apple investor this year, with its shares down 8% since Jan. 1.\n\nMacroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in 2023, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Its first quarter of 2024 finally broke the streak, with revenue growth of 2% year over year to $120 billion as it beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\n\nBut outperforming estimates hasn't been enough to quell investor concerns about other areas of Apple's business. In the first quarter of 2024, the iPhone division reported a 6% rise in total sales, yet they fell 13% in China. That country increasingly prefers domestic brands over the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market.\n\nYet, like Intel, Apple is making major changes to its business. The company's stock popped 4% on April 11, marking its best performance in almost a year. The rally came after a Bloomberg report revealed the company will overhaul its Mac computer lineup to focus on AI.\n\nApple dominates consumer tech, with leading market shares in most of its product categories. Immense brand loyalty from consumers could see the company become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI, allowing it to carve out a lucrative position in the market. As a result, news that future products will place a stronger focus on the generative technology is promising.\n\nMoreover, despite recent headwinds, Apple's free cash flow hit $107 billion last year, significantly more than rivals like Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet. The figure indicates Apple has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and overcome recurrent challenges. AAPL Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nApple's high free cash flow has also made it one of the best-valued stocks in big tech. The chart above shows it has the lowest price-to-free cash flow out of many of its competitors and one of the lowest forward P/E ratios.\n\nThe company has a reputation for providing investors with significant and consistent gains over the long term. I wouldn't bet against Apple continuing this trend over the next decade, and its stock is worth considering right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple loses its spot as the world’s top seller of smartphones after tough China competition from brands like Xiaomi and Huawei",
        "content": "Just one quarter after taking first place in the global smartphone market, Apple is back in second. The iPhone maker delivered 50.1 million units in the first quarter of 2024, a 9.6% year-on-year drop, according to a report from research firm IDC. The fall puts Apple behind Korea’s Samsung, which sold 60.1 million units.\n\nThe troublesome market for Apple? China. Chinese consumers are turning away from Apple's latest iPhone and instead buying from local champions like Xiaomi and Huawei. “Increased competition in China is a big part of Apple’s decline in Q1,” Nabila Popal, a research director for IDC's worldwide tracker team, told Bloomberg.\n\nApple now has 17.3% of the global market. By comparison, Samsung has 20.8% market share; the Korean company's first-quarter shipments dropped by 0.7% year-on-year.\n\nThree Chinese smartphone manufacturers—Xiaomi, Transsion, and OPPO—round out the top five. Together, the three firms shipped 94.5 million units with a combined market share of 32.7%. IDC estimated that Transsion, a budget-focused brand that’s found success in emerging markets, shipped 85% more phones this quarter than a year ago.\n\nApple’s decline comes even as the overall smartphone market recovers from a post-COVID slump. Smartphone sales rose 7.8% to reach 289.4 million units, according to IDC. “Smartphone recovery continues to move forward with market optimism slowly building among the top brands,” Ryan Reith, IDC's group vice president for worldwide mobility and consumer device trackers, said in a statement.\n\nApple’s China problems\n\nApple reported a 13% year-on-year drop in its sales in China, one of its most important non-U.S markets, in the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, even as global iPhone sales rose 6%.\n\nApple will report its next quarterly earnings, including China sales, in early May. But independent research reports that the company’s slump is extending into 2024. iPhone sales in China dropped by 24% in the first six weeks of the year compared to the same period a year earlier, according to a March report from Counterpoint Research.\n\nChina’s smartphone market is shrinking amid the country’s broader slump in consumer confidence. Counterpoint Research estimated earlier this year that overall phone shipments in China dropped by 7% in the first six weeks of the year.\n\nChinese consumers have been slow to embrace Apple’s new iPhone 15, with both Apple and third-party resellers offering discounts just a few months after the model’s release. “Consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” Mengmeng Zhang, a senior analyst with Counterpoint, said at the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is also facing regulatory scrutiny from the Chinese government. Last year, Beijing reportedly banned use of the iPhone by government officials as part of a wider drive for tech self-sufficiency. (Also in Beijing’s cross-hairs: Microsoft Windows and Intel processors).\n\nRenewed China competition\n\nYet Apple also faces a more crowded Chinese market.\n\nOne major competitor is Huawei. The Chinese tech giant’s phone sales rose 64% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint. Huawei returned to the premium smartphone market last year with the Mate 60 Pro, a 5G smartphone featuring a homegrown processor.\n\nOther brands, like Honor—born from Huawei’s decision to spin-off its budget smartphone division in the wake of U.S. sanctions—are also expanding market share as they expand into more expensive handhelds.\n\nXiaomi—the world’s third-largest seller of smartphones, according to IDC—is also entering a sector that Apple abandoned: Electric cars. Earlier this year, the Chinese smartphone maker launched its first EV, the SU7. The model racked up 120,000 orders in 36 hours, and Xiaomi is warning that the waitlist may extend to over half a year.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Samsung Electronics Co. regained the top spot. Budget-focused brand Transsion jumped 85% in shipments, while Xiaomi Corp. bounced back to close the gap on second-place Apple.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has struggled to sustain sales in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, since the debut of its latest iPhone generation in September. Those issues are weighing on its global results. The company shipped 5 million fewer iPhones than it did a year earlier, according to IDC’s preliminary figures.\n\n“The smartphone market is emerging from the turbulence of the last two years both stronger and changed,” said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC. “While the top two players both saw negative growth in the first quarter, it seems Samsung is in a stronger position overall than they were in recent quarters.”\n\nAverage selling prices for handsets are rising, as consumers increasingly opt for premium models that they intend to hold on to for longer, IDC’s researchers found. Apple is likely to have sold a higher proportion of its iPhone 15 Pro devices, resulting in higher revenue per unit.

        "title": "Antitrust fervor is gripping Washington and Silicon Valley. But lawsuits have been declining.",
        "content": "US antitrust lawsuits have been falling since the pandemic despite a high-profile legal war pitting Washington against Silicon Valley.\n\nCivil antitrust cases alleging monopolistic mergers or business practices fell 42% between March 2020 and March 2023, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, dropping to 361 from 626.\n\nThe numbers have gotten smaller despite a wide-ranging push during that period by the Biden administration to limit the concentration of power in key industries, including Big Tech.\n\nThe administration has alleged antitrust violations by tech giants Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), while taking to trial a case filed by the Trump administration against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). It is also trying to block mergers that could eliminate competition in other industries.\n\nThe number of government antitrust cases filed for the 12-month period ending in March 2023 fell to 9, from 28 in 2020.\n\nThe number of private suits brought by companies alleging unfair competition in their industries fell to 352, down 42% from 2020.\n\nIt is possible that lawsuits rebounded over the last year; the government's figures for the 12-month period ending in March 2024 are not yet available.\n\nA separate analysis from legal analytics company Lex Machina shows a 19% increase for all of 2023. But even Lex Machina said that its figures show a general decline in antitrust filings over the last decade.\n\n\"Since 2015, the trend has been fairly significantly downward,\" said Ron Porter, a data expert with the company.\n\n\"It's a very real trend.\"\n\n'Not easily answered'\n\nWhy the general decline? Legal observers have a number of theories.\n\n\"It's a good question but not easily answered,\" New York University economist Lawrence White said.\n\nPerhaps a stronger enforcement climate is keeping anticompetitive behavior in check, or the government is choosing to go after bigger targets in exchange for fewer cases to save on costs and staffing.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan told Jon Stewart last week on the Daily Show that when confronting big companies her staff sometimes can be “outgunned” on lawyers by as much as 10 to 1.\n\n\"We play to our strengths,\" she said, by being \"strategic\" and \"entrepreneurial.\" Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing a new antitrust suit against Apple in March. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) (Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\nOther theories to explain the decline in antitrust cases are that companies increasingly view courts as unreceptive to their claims, or fear that the financial risk to take on an antitrust case is too high.\n\nSome antitrust experts attribute the decrease to federal court decisions in a series of cases, including one Supreme Court case in 2004 where it ruled against arguments that Bell Atlantic and other successor companies to the old AT&T engaged in anticompetitive behavior.\n\nMore stringent requirements applied by other courts over the years also increased the burdens on private plaintiffs, particularly class-action plaintiffs, according to a 2020 report from attorneys at law firm Simpson Thacher.\n\nThat, according to the report, resulted in reduced frequency of filings and larger and more complex cases.\n\n\"It has to be a really meritorious case with high potential for significant reward,\" said Randy Stutz, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, an organization that advocates for more robust antitrust enforcement by the federal government.\n\nHe suspects that high bar is likely keeping some credible claims from being filed.\n\n\"The value proposition is changing,\" he added.\n\nThe drop in private cases could be a concern for federal antitrust regulators because corporate plaintiffs can provide \"deregulated\" checks and balances that can be overlooked or under-prosecuted by government regulators, University of Michigan Law School professor Daniel Crane said in a 2010 article. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. (Kevin Wurm/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nFederal antitrust regulators like the FTC and the Justice Department have \"become more and more dependent on private actions that serve that deterrent function,\" Stutz said.\n\nWhite, who sits on the advisory board of the American Antitrust Institute, disagrees that the decline in lawsuits can be easily attributed to a single cause, like less enforcement power.\n\n\"I'm very sympathetic to much of what AAI does, otherwise I wouldn't be on their board,\" White said. \"But to wring your hands and decry every time there's a decline in lawsuits filed and think that means there's less enforcement, that doesn't follow.\"\n\nThere's no question, White said, that US court decisions have made it harder to bring antitrust lawsuits. But what makes it complicated to pinpoint the exact cause of a case decline, he added, is that government penalties have become steeper for antitrust violations.\n\n\"Fines are steep,\" he said. \"And people go to jail for price fixing.\"\n\n'The system is rigged'\n\nThe calculus to go forward with an antitrust case is even more challenging for businesses that rely on dominant firms in their supply and distribution chains. Those companies, Stutz said, may shy away from antagonizing a critical partner with an antitrust suit.\n\nTo bring an antitrust suit against Amazon as a private plaintiff you would have to hire a \"fancy antitrust lawyer\" and \"a fancy antitrust economist\" and thus \"the scale doesn't make sense to bring these claims individually,\" economist expert Hal Singer, managing director of Econ One, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill during an antitrust hearing in February 2021.\n\n\"And so the system is rigged effectively to immunize Amazon from antitrust scrutiny, at least by private complainants.\"\n\nSome recognizable companies, however, have decided to take on that risk over the past year.\n\nThe latest crop of company-initiated cases includes complaints by pharmaceutical giant Regeneron (REGN) against rival Novartis (NVS); publishers Helena World Chronicle and Gannett (GCI) against Google; and a group of pharmacies challenging the actions of Cigna’s pharmacy benefit management organization Express Scripts (CI). Regeneron is among the companies that have decided to bring antitrust suits against other companies. (Brendan McDermid/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nCompanies have had mixed results. In two closely watched antitrust cases by popular video game developer Epic Games against Apple and Google over their respective app stores, Epic won its case against Google but mostly lost the case against Apple.\n\nOne private company successfully challenged a merger. The case, brought by door manufacturer Steves & Sons, unwound a tie-up between door and frame manufacturers Jeld-Wen (JELD) and competitor CMI.\n\nAnother set of antitrust cases upended the real estate industry. Residential home sellers across the country alleged the National Association of Realtors, its member agents, and Keller Williams and HomeServices of America illegally required sellers to pay buyers' agent commissions.\n\nA federal jury in Missouri in one case returned a $1.78 billion verdict in favor of sellers, a figure that could as much as triple, or decrease, at the presiding judge's discretion.\n\nAnother case was dismissed. US Wholesale was not able to successfully argue that rival Living Essentials unfairly offered Costco better prices, discounts, and reimbursements on sales of 5-hour Energy. But the case left the door open to allow US Wholesale to refile its claim.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech will outperform in a high interest rate environment: Wall Street pros",
        "content": "No rate cuts, no problem.\n\nInvestors are revisiting an old playbook as mega-cap tech stocks came back in favor last week. The appetite for growth returned during Thursday’s trading action, despite another hot inflation report that puts rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year in doubt.\n\nThat was a bit of a surprise, given that growth stocks are typically more sensitive to higher interest rates. But experts say the reason why is clear: Strong fundamentals and large cash piles.\n\n“Many of these mega cap growth stocks are flush with cash and have lower debt levels, and therefore tend to be less dependent on financing needs and less interest rate sensitive,” Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFree cash flow from Magnificent 7 members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — jumped more than $100 billion in 2023.\n\nLast week, the group outperformed the broader market, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ending the week with gains, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.6% decline. Amazon hit an all-time high, and Alphabet’s valuation briefly crossed $2 trillion. Even Apple finally caught a bid with investors, recording its best day in nearly a year.\n\nAnd Wall Street pros tell Yahoo Finance that the group will likely continue to outperform in a higher-for-longer rate environment, at least on a relative basis.\n\nNewEdge Wealth’s Cameron Dawson said big tech’s solid balance sheets and fundamentals suggest the group is a “defensive” and “safety” play, adding that pullbacks are “likely buyable in the short-term.”\n\n“Tech would be somewhat less sensitive to fewer Fed rate cuts compared to other sectors, and would likely outperform in such an environment,” said Lerner.\n\nIn addition to large cash piles, a resilient economy will be a boon to the Mag 7, Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance. So far, there are few signs that higher rates are slowing GDP growth or corporate earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetrick expects continued economic growth to “offer opportunities for the group, even in the face of less rate cuts.”\n\nA more resilient economy can stimulate business activity, and ultimately boost profits this earnings season, another expected driver of big tech in the near term. Analysts estimate the sector’s first-quarter profits to surge 20%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives sees first-quarter results as a “major positive catalyst.”\n\n“We expect tech stocks to be up another 15% for the year adding to the strong start to 2024 as now the broader tech growth story takes center stage,” Ives wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nTo sum it up: Delayed rate cuts don't mean a downturn for tech's biggest names. Rather, those with strong fundamentals can outperform — despite valuation and rate concerns — and potentially provide stability for the broader market landscape.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSomething weird happened in the stock market this week — besides the thumping from a surprise Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nMarket darling Nvidia's (NVDA) stock fell into correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from a recent high.\n\nAt its low of around $830 midway through Tuesday's session, the stock was down 12.6% from its March 25 high. It has since recovered a bit to $900 but is still off by 5% from the highs.\n\n\"This is a breather for Nvidia, as more investors are playing the 2nd and 3rd derivatives of AI across the semi and software ecosystem,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me. \"We view this as a digestion period for the Street for Nvidia and nothing more.\"\n\nMaybe that will prove correct. Who knows?\n\nBank of America analyst Vivek Arya notes volatility in Nvidia is nothing new — the current sell-off marks the ninth time the stock has declined 10% or more since ChatGPT was launched back in late 2022.\n\n\"There are some market factors such as the recent rise in inflation, volatility (VIX), AI stock fatigue, rotation towards more cyclical sectors and possibly some pruning ahead of upcoming earnings season,\" Arya said. \"On a fundamental basis we have also heard of investor concern around rising competition and reducing lead-times (suggesting decelerating demand) for Nvidia GPU accelerators (though expected as new Blackwell demand grows).\" CEO Jensen Huang during the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nI happen to think Nvidia's stock sell-off is a near-term headwind to the broader markets that should be respected way more than it is. Arya gets at it a bit in his note, but it warrants further amplification.\n\nHere is a stock truly beloved by Wall Street and Main Street — for real, fundamental reasons such as the AI explosion powering demand for super chips — losing ground. It's one of the clearest signs yet that investors think stocks have come on too hard and too fast this year against a backdrop of higher for longer interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the price action suggests investors who are actively seeking new reasons to buy stocks at peak valuations are coming up empty. Now, they may simply be waiting to buy top names like Nvidia at cheaper prices.\n\nThat wait-and-see mindset is what the pros are doing with Nvidia's stock and other stocks with a high valuation but well-understood investment thesis.\n\nAnd it's not like we haven't seen Nvidia leading the broader market lower before — it happened last summer!\n\nEvercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel correctly pointed out that Nvidia's stock did next to nothing from July 2023 to October 2023 (chart below). It ended up being the catalyst that brought the S&P 500 lower.\n\nBottom line: For the broader market to get its mojo back, its favorite stock has to get its mojo back.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Every investor would agree that the stock market is a fantastic asset class for people to build life-changing wealth. Compounding can work its magic, leading to tremendous results.\n\nHowever, there are specific businesses that have absolutely crushed the market, as defined by the S&P 500. Just look at tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker has produced a total return for its shareholders of 170,000% ever since it started trading on the public markets in December 1980. That monster gain means a $1,000 investment back then would be worth a jaw-dropping $1.7 million today.\n\nApple has undoubtedly been one of corporate America's most prominent success stories, so it's worthwhile to look back and try to understand what factors contributed to its rise. Then, we can answer if the consumer discretionary stock is a worthy portfolio addition today.\n\nOne of the world's most valuable companies\n\nAs of this writing, Apple is worth a whopping $2.7 trillion. Only Microsoft carries a higher market cap. A company doesn't get to that kind of valuation without doing some things right.\n\nApple's shares have performed so well precisely because the company's revenue and net income have skyrocketed historically. Perhaps the most important factor that has propelled this business is its incredible brand strength, which is what supports its economic moat and keeps competitors at bay. Selling popular hardware devices that consumers absolutely love also gives Apple pricing power.\n\nSpeaking of hardware, this business might be second to none when it comes to product innovation. The iPhone might be the single greatest product introduction in modern history, from both a financial perspective and how it influenced society. This competency has translated to other areas, both in terms of hardware and services that Apple offers.\n\nApple might be an American-born enterprise, but there's no denying that it has become a global icon. In fiscal 2023, the majority of total revenue was derived outside the U.S. This points to its broad appeal from consumers everywhere.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you buy Apple stock right now?\n\nEven in more recent times, Apple shares have been a big winner. In the past five years, the stock is up 249%, a gain that crushes the broader Nasdaq Composite Index. The great Warren Buffett is a huge fan of the business, allowing Apple to become a massive 43% weighting in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio today.\n\nBut with the stock down 12% from its peak price, which was achieved at the end of last year, is Apple a smart buy? To be clear, I believe that investors shouldn't add this business to their portfolios. There are two reasons I feel strongly about this viewpoint.\n\nFirst is Apple's growth outlook. This is an extremely mature enterprise today. It still relies heavily on the success of the iPhone, with the hope that consumers continue upgrading their devices frequently, even though new features might not be as game changing as they were a decade ago.\n\nYes, the services division is reporting solid sales gains. But that wasn't enough to prevent Apple from posting a revenue decline in fiscal 2023. There's no reason to believe the business can introduce a revolutionary product to get meaningful revenue growth going forward.\n\nApple's current valuation also leads me to believe that the return potential is limited. You can scoop up the shares today at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.3. A valid argument can be made that a competitively advantaged business like this with outsized profitability deserves that valuation. However, I believe it's an expensive entry point that significantly reduces the likelihood that Apple will outperform the S&P 500 in the years ahead.\n\nThis stock was a huge winner in the past. I'm not sure if that trend will continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Tim Cook succeeded Steve Jobs as Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO on Aug. 24, 2011. Just six weeks later, Jobs passed away from pancreatic cancer. At the time, many investors considered Jobs' death to be the end of an era.\n\nJobs had returned to Apple on Sept. 16, 1997 -- exactly 12 years after being ousted from the company he co-founded -- and revived its ailing business with the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Jobs, Apple disrupted the PC, MP3 player, smartphone, and tablet computer markets with its sleekly designed and easy-to-use products.\n\nFrom fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2011 (which ended in September 2011), Apple's annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from $7.1 billion to $108.3 billion. From Jobs' first day back to Cook's ascension as its CEO, Apple's stock rallied 6,760%. A modest $2,000 investment would have grown to $137,200. Image source: Apple.\n\nIt was tempting to cash out of Apple after Jobs handed the reins over to Cook, who had mainly been known for scaling up the company's production capabilities instead of developing its hardware products, but that would have been a massive mistake.\n\nWhy did Apple continue to thrive under Tim Cook?\n\nApple's stock has risen 1,150% since Cook's first day as its permanent CEO. It also delivered a total return of 1,380% after reinvesting the dividends which Cook reinstated in 2012. That $2,000 investment in Jobs' first day back at Apple would have continued growing to $2.03 million under Cook's watch after including its reinvested dividends.\n\nEven if you didn't buy Apple's stock during Jobs' tenure, you still could have made a lot of money by betting on Tim Cook's ability to expand the company. If you had simply invested $2,000 in Apple on the day Cook took over and reinvested your dividends, your investment would be worth more than $20,000 today.\n\nFrom fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2023, Apple's revenue grew at a CAGR of 11% to $383.3 billion. Most of that growth was driven by the iPhone, which still accounted for over half of its revenue in fiscal 2023. It also grew its earnings per share (EPS) at a CAGR of 16% as it bought back more than 40% of its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnder Cook, Apple launched new hardware products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, and Vision Pro. But only two (the Apple Watch and AirPods) were considered hit products. The HomePod struggled to gain ground against Amazon in the smart speaker market, and the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget for early adopters. Apple also recently abandoned its plans to build an electric car after pouring billions of dollars into the secretive project for a decade.\n\nThat's a mixed track record, but Cook also directed Apple to expand its services business with new subscription-based services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade. The ecosystem -- which also houses its App Store and iCloud platform -- now serves over a billion paid subscribers. Apple generated more than a fifth of its revenue from those services in fiscal 2023, and they could lock in more of its users, curb its long-term dependence on the iPhone, and challenge companies like Netflix and Spotify in the growing streaming media market.\n\nDoes Apple still have room to run?\n\nApple might not be pulling rabbits out of its hat as it did every few years under Steve Jobs, but it's still expanding, making plenty of money, and returning a lot of that cash to its investors through buybacks and dividends. It's also still one of the few consumer electronic brands that can also be considered a bona fide luxury brand.\n\nApple ended its latest quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities, so it still has plenty of ways to expand its ecosystem through big investments and acquisitions. That's probably why Warren Buffett continues to allocate more than 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's entire portfolio to Apple.\n\nApple's stock has declined more than 10% this year as investors fret over its declining iPhone sales in China, regulatory headwinds for its App Store, the Vision Pro's lackluster launch, and the abrupt end of its electric vehicle dreams.\n\nBut over the long term, Apple's business will likely bounce back as it rolls out new hardware products, expands its services ecosystem, and rewards its patient investors with bigger dividends and buybacks. So before you decide to give up on Apple, remember what happened to those investors who hastily sold their shares when Tim Cook took over nearly 13 years ago.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\n(Reuters) - IPhone maker Apple on Friday denied violating a court order governing its App Store and urged a California federal judge to reject a request by “Fortnite” developer Epic Games to hold it in contempt.\n\nApple made the arguments in a filing to U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, who presided over Epic’s lawsuit in 2020 accusing Apple of violating antitrust law with its tight controls over how consumers download apps and pay for transactions within them.\n\nThe Apple filing criticized what it called an attempt by Epic to make Apple's \"tools and technologies available to developers for free.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEpic, it said, wanted the court \"to micromanage Apple’s business operations in a way that would increase Epic’s profitability.\"\n\nEpic declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the dispute, part of a long fight between the two companies.\n\nEpic largely lost its case against Apple, but Rogers in 2021 ordered Apple to give developers greater freedom to guide app users to alternative payment methods for digital goods.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in January declined to hear Apple's appeal of the injunction order.\n\nEpic said in a court filing last month that Cupertino, California-based Apple was in “blatant violation” of the court’s injunction. It pointed to Apple’s imposition of a 27% fee on developers for some purchases, which the video game maker said makes links for alternative payment options \"commercially unusable.\"\n\nEpic also alleged Apple barred some apps from informing users about other ways to pay for goods.\n\nMeta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk’s X and Match Group last month echoed Epic’s arguments, telling Rogers that Apple was in “clear violation” of the court’s order.\n\nIn a similar case that Epic brought against Alphabet's Google, a judge in San Francisco is expected this year to issue a separate injunction affecting the Google Play Store.\n\nThe case is Epic Games Inc v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 20-05640.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella, Editing by Nick Zieminski)",

        "content": "The Masters Tournament is adding virtual reality and generative AI to the golf fan experience in the latest attempt to grow the game.\n\nFor the 2024 tournament, IBM (IBM) and Masters introduced an app for the Apple (AAPL) Vision Pro for fans of the sport who can’t make the trip to Augusta National Golf Course in Georgia.\n\n“This year’s new Hole Insights feature, for example, uses eight years of historical Tournament data — more than 170,000 shots — to provide fans detailed breakdowns of how the course at Augusta has played,” Noah Syken, IBM's vice president of Sports and Entertainment, wrote in a statement to Yahoo Finance. “That level of detail allows a life-long golf fan following along at home to feel more connected to the action, while also making the game more approachable for a new fan at the same time.”\n\nA Masters invitation is one of golf’s most coveted for players, and it's hosted at Augusta National, one of the most exclusive country clubs in the world. Entry isn’t guaranteed for fans, either, and tickets are limited to Masters lottery winners.

Now, the Masters app, combined with IBM watsonx data and the Apple Vision Pro device, expands an experiential portal for fans who want to enjoy the event affordably from afar.\n\n“This partnership is a great example of how data and AI can lead to once-unimaginable digital experiences that help fans feel closer to the events they care about,” Syken said.

        "title": "3 Dow Jones Dividend Stocks That Are Within 6% of Their 52-Week Lows to Buy Now",
        "content": "Even with recent market turbulence, it has been an overall good year in the stock market. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average is only up 2.4% year to date (YTD) -- lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite's nearly 7% YTD return and the S&P 500's nearly 8% gain.\n\nThe Dow Jones contains many industry-leading blue chip companies. However, there are plenty of Dow stocks that are down this year, and some particularly big names that are within 6% of their 52-week lows -- including Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nike(NYSE: NKE), and UnitedHealth(NYSE: UNH). Here's why all three dividend stocks are down, but why they could be worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFrom sector leader to sector underperformer\n\nApple is arguably the most surprising stock on this list. It makes up over 7% of the Nasdaq Composite. And despite Apple weighing down the index, the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high on March 21 and is still up big on the year. Investors have been used to Apple leading the market, not lagging behind it.\n\nThe underperformance is even more drastic when looking at the technology sector. Apple makes up 19.2% of the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the performance of the tech sector. Yet, the stock is about flat over the last year, while the sector is up over 35%. ^IXT Chart\n\nIt would be one thing if Apple were simply part of a broader Nasdaq and tech sector sell-off. But any time you see an industry leader move in the opposite direction of its peer group, that's usually a sign that investors have specific concerns about a company.\n\nFor Apple, the concerns are mostly justified. The growth just isn't there. Sales in Apple's second most important market -- China -- are declining. Apple's lack of artificial intelligence (AI) monetization, and frankly innovation in general, is a bad look compared to other big tech stocks like Microsoft and Nvidia that are leveraging AI as a coiled spring for multi-decade growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple looks out of step, so it's hard to fault investors for hitting the sell button. To make matters worse, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Apple for monetizing smartphone markets.\n\nThe silver lining is that Apple has a mere 26.1 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- making it far cheaper than the tech sector's 38.7 P/E ratio. Apple generates plenty of cash, allowing it to repurchase stock and raise the dividend even during slowing growth.\n\nOne look at Apple's meager 0.6% dividend yield may lead you to believe the company has a weak capital return program. In fact, it simply chooses to distribute the vast majority of funds through buybacks rather than the dividend. Apple's buybacks have been an excellent investment, considering the stock's performance. Buybacks can be particularly effective when a stock is beaten-down, and the company can swoop in and repurchase shares on the cheap.\n\nCounting Apple out has been a losing bet in the past. The company's brand and vertical integration are still strong, so value investors may want to step in and consider the stock now.\n\nIt's time to move past Nike's temporary earnings spike\n\nDespite its underperformance, Apple has still produced market-beating gains over the last five years. The same can't be said about Nike. Despite putting up monster gains in 2020 and 2021, Nike stock has round-tripped and is now about where it was five years ago. AAPL Chart\n\nNike is a good example of why it is bad to anchor a stock to a price it probably should have never reached in the first place. During the height of the pandemic, people had limited options to spend on services, so they flocked to goods spending. Nike benefited greatly from that. However, the growth proved to be short-lived. NKE Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nAs you can see in the chart, Nike's earnings per share and operating margin initially plummeted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but then shot up in 2021 -- corresponding with the stock's record high. Sales have ticked up, but at the expense of lower earnings and margins. The business is closer to where it was pre-pandemic than where it was in 2021, so it's understandable why the stock price has retraced.\n\nTo its credit, Nike has prioritized its capital return program amid slowing growth. It is buying back stock and its dividend is up 68% in just five years.Granted, the stock yields just 1.6%, but Nike is turning into a worthy dividend candidate, rather than relying purely on growth as it did in the past.\n\nLike Apple, Nike is one of the most influential brands in the world. Nike now has just a 26.2 price-to-earnings ratio -- below the S&P 500's 27.9 P/E. The short-term outlook isn't great, but patient investors are getting the chance to buy Nike at a compelling price.\n\nDip your toes into the healthcare sector with UnitedHeatlh\n\nLike Apple, health insurance provider UnitedHealth still outperformed the market over the last five years. But the stock has sold off recently, mainly due to a lower-than-expected payment rate increase for the 2025 calendar year.\n\nUnitedHealth's growth is heavily dependent on its Medicare business, so the sell-off makes sense. To make matters worse, UnitedHealth was also the victim of a cyberattack, which caused the company to fall behind on claims payments.\n\nShort-term challenges aside, it would be a mistake to underestimate UnitedHealth's role in the healthcare sector. Drugmakers push the boundaries of innovation, but insurance is the glue that holds the U.S. healthcare system together. The sector has ballooned to become the country's third-largest sector, behind only financials and tech.\n\nUnitedHealth is a good choice for investors who want to invest in the healthcare sector, but not through a high-flying drugmaker like Eli Lilly. UnitedHealth lies on the stodgier end of the healthcare sector and is more focused on moderate growth and raising its dividend -- which is up 400% over the last decade. It has a 19.1 P/E ratio, making it a good value for those looking for less expensive stocks to buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "11 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best nanotechnology stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our introduction to the nanotechnology sector and how it covers a variety of applications ranging from healthcare to consumer technology, then you can skip ahead to read 5 Best Nanotechnology Stocks To Invest In.\n\nJust like artificial intelligence, nanotechnology is another set of technologies that once belonged to the realm of science fiction. Nanotechnology refers to items that are smaller than 100 nanometers. These are used in a wide variety of applications, such as sunscreen and medicines since the small size of the particles allows them to behave in ways that regularly sized items cannot.\n\nOne of the most lucrative applications of nanotechnology comes in the semiconductor industry. Modern day chips, such as those that power Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone or the latest artificial intelligence graphics processing units from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), are made of transistors that are often as small as just a couple of nanometers. In fact, the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is currently mass producing semiconductors with feature sizes as small as 3 nanometers. Nothing short of magic, making transistors that are just nanometers wide or long provides chips with dozens of benefits over their predecessors, with the most evident ones being improved electrical conductivity, better power efficiency, and of course, higher computing power.\n\nAnother well known user of nanotechnology is the medical industry. It is used for a wide variety of direct and indirect medicinal purposes, such as treating cancer, imaging diseases, and even making new tissues. One such company is the Paris, France based biotechnology firm Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX). A specialized biotechnology firm, Nanobiotix uses nano particles to fight cancers of the head, pancreas, and other regions and organs of the human body. The three analysts that cover the stock have rated the shares as Strong Buy on average, and priced in a hefty upside through an average share price target of $11.98. In fact, April 2024 is turning out to be a crucial month for Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) as the firm completed the dose escalation portion of its first phase trial of a lung cancer treatment called NBTXR3.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe treatment targets small cell lung cancer, and it is aimed to help specifically those patients who cannot be treated by surgery or those who have seen their cancer return after earlier bouts of radiation therapy. It uses hafnium oxide nano particles, and Nanobiotix S.A. (NASDAQ:NBTX) is optimistic that while the current trial is only working with lung cancer patients, future uses of NBTXR3 could apply to other cancers as well given hafnium oxide's mechanism of action. Wall Street, it seems, is having a hard time believing the firm, as the stock is down by 15% year to date.\n\nHowever, while Nanobiotix hasn't done well this year, what about the broader nanotechnology sector? Since nanotechnology covers a wide variety of use cases, some of which we've covered above, it is difficult to ascribe to the sector defined determinants of share price performance. In other words, for example, while the broader biotechnology sector tends to underperform when interest rates are high, the same cannot be said with certainty for all nanotechnology firms.\n\nYet, we can see how stock indexes that allow investors to track the sector are doing. One such stock index is the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index. It tracks \"companies that produce nanoscale materials, as well as those that use nanotechnology in their production lines or that build machines capable of measuring information at the nanoscale,\" which provides it exposure to the broader nanotechnology sector as opposed to customized use cases such as chips and medicines. So how are these nanotechnology stocks performing? Well, the index is up by 9.48% year to date, however, its performance over the past 12 months and three years hasn't been too encouraging. Over these two time periods, the S&P Kensho Nanotechnology Index has been negative 7.5% and negative 25.10%.

        "content": "The emergence of artificial intelligence stands as a force ready to transform several prominent industries. Investors looking to seize a rare chance to capitalize on these gains have aimed their efforts at leading semiconductor stocks to quadruple their money. Such a move clearly makes sense.\n\nDemand for high-powered AI chips powering self-driving cars and medical diagnosis continues to soar. This growth isn’t hype — 2024 forecasts unprecedented market expansion. AI demands advanced chip structures for data handling and computations. These stocks enable investors to profit from AI’s explosive growth.\n\nSemiconductors revolutionize modern life. Consider investing in semiconductor stocks in April as long-term bets. These are three of the top players in the sector that I don’t think get enough love. Accordingly, those looking for a more diversified chips portfolio should look at the stocks investors are looking at now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst off the list is the Asian semiconductor company Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company’s Q1 earnings were recently released, and these numbers impressed investors with Taiwan Semi’s excellent results.\n\nTSMC stock surged as the company reported 16.5% sales growth on a year-over-year basis. The company’s March-quarter sales hit $18.86 billion, easily surpassing estimates of $18.26 billion. Previous-year sales were $16.62 billion, signaling strong growth over time. TSMC’s Q1 revenue rebounded after four quarters of decline. Clients include some of the most prominent names in this space, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAnalyst Charles Shi maintained a buy rating for TSM stock, raising his price target to $168 from R133. He cited TSMC’s strength in AI and said that despite the impact of an earthquake, the company expects to meet its full-year growth target. Shi predicts a Q3 recovery, and I’m in line with this view.\n\nThe company also holds 50% of the contract chip manufacturing market to add to this thesis.  It dominates the highest-performing computing sector. Alongside AMD, Nvidia and Broadcom, TSMC also shares the success of AI chips as these companies rely on TSMC. With cutting-edge chip tech like 3nm and upcoming 2nm processes, TSMC drives AI innovation. Bullish forecasts predict over 20% revenue growth in FY24. Expanding with new plants in Germany and Japan, TSMC leads the AI revolution.\n\nASML Holding NV (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPredicted to have an upward trajectory until 2027, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is a semiconductor stock every investor should have in their portfolio right now. Analysts predict a 25% rise to $1,215 per share by 2025. Progression suggests $1,500 in 2026 and nearly $1,900 by 2027, doubling the current value. ASML’s dominance in chip technology, especially EUV lithograph, which is crucial for AI, supports this potential growth.\n\nBased in the Netherlands, the company revolutionizes semiconductor production for Intel and TSMC using EUV light, creating ultra-thin lines on silicon. Its lithography dominance, shielded by patents, faces challenges from espionage and trade disputes.\n\nASML’s future shines bright, particularly in lithography. Mordor Intelligence forecasts over 11% annual growth for EUV lithography through 2029. Demand for high-performance chips, essential for AI, fuels ASML’s prospects, with Taiwan Semiconductor as a critical client. Moreover, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst’s note highlights favorable risk/reward in ASML, driven by AI momentum.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecently upgraded by analysts, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) excels in semiconductor and display equipment, favored by JPMorgan(NYSE:JPM) with a $260 price target. Strategic positioning and tech advancements, like HBM and GAA, position the company well for market share growth in a projected $110 billion market by 2025. Q1 results surpassed forecasts, underlining its market strength and strategic accuracy.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald also upgraded Applied Materials to overweight, raising their price target to $260 per share. Expectations of a strong semiconductor equipment market drove this shift. Applied Materials’ strategic position and tech advancements, including HBM and GAA transistors, fuel optimism for market share growth.\n\nApplied Materials’ GAAP earnings were $2.41 per share, exceeding the non-GAAP $2.13. Despite a slight sales decline from Q1 2023, improved gross and operating margins led to a 19% year-over-year profit increase. Services segment profitability, notably, rose significantly, aiding overall profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Tech stocks have rallied in the past year, making it harder for growth investors to find good deals. Demand is high for many popular members of the Nasdaq Composite Index, which is up 10% so far in 2024 after soaring last year.\n\nOne great way to minimize your risk of overpaying for a stock in this environment is to have a longer time frame. Investing with a decade or more in mind will allow you to look past short-term volatility and the inevitable ups and downs of market returns.\n\nWith that long-term focus in mind, let's look at two tech stocks that, while they aren't cheap, have a good shot at helping boost your portfolio returns from here.\n\n1. Garmin\n\nIf you've decided to pass on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock right now because of its slow growth, consider owning Garmin(NYSE: GRMN) instead. The tech device specialist expanded revenue at a 13% rate last quarter, compared with Apple's 2% uptick. Garmin saw robust demand for its fitness watches and its GPS-enabled smartwatches, too. \"We are entering 2024 with strong momentum,\" CEO Cliff Pemble said in a press release.\n\nIt's true that Garmin's sales are more heavily tilted toward hardware, which isn't as profitable as software services. That's a big factor behind its weaker operating profit margin of 21%, compared with Apple's 31% rate.\n\nYet Garmin is still generating ample earnings and stellar cash flow. The company produced $1.2 billion of free cash flow last year, translating into nearly 25% of sales. It's available at a decent discount, too, even though shares have rallied in the past year. You can own Garmin for 5.5 times sales today, compared with Apple's premium of 6.9 times revenue.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock will see volatility around its April 24 earnings report, but investors don't have to wait until then to snap up this stellar business.\n\nMeta's core engagement metrics are solid heading into that announcement. The social media giant last reported that its base of daily users hit 3.2 billion through late 2023. And a whopping 80% of its monthly users log on to its family of apps, anchored by Instagram and Facebook, every day.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta is monetizing that usage much better than in the past. Last quarter, average revenue per user crossed $10, thanks to the higher volume of ads the company is showing in feeds.\n\nI'll be looking for Meta to find a way to increase average advertising rates in the upcoming earnings report, which could unlock even faster earnings growth. But its momentum at this point is already quite strong. Operating income jumped 62% last year to reach $46 billion, or 35% of sales.\n\nThe next year might not be nearly as impressive because of Meta's choice to invest heavily in areas such as data centers, artificial intelligence capacity, and its virtual reality hardware. But look for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team to highlight the stellar returns that this spending could generate over the next decade or more. That's the same long-term focus that investors should have for this stock, since it's the best way to ensure that you can weather the volatility that's probably following Meta's huge rally over the past year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Can Taiwan Semiconductor Stock (NYSE:TSM) Replicate Nvidia’s Performance?",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), the world’s largest chipmaker, recently posted impressive revenue figures for March. Notably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has gained 242.5% in the past year, relies on TSM for chip manufacturing. However, TSM’s stock performance (up 71.5% over the same period; see the comparison image below) has been relatively subdued. This begs the question: can TSM replicate NVDA’s stellar performance? The answer is likely a “yes.”\n\nWith the ongoing AI boom, increased funding from the U.S., and an attractive valuation, TSM looks like a compelling buy right now.\n\nPre-Earnings Numbers Point to Positive Outlook for Upcoming Earnings\n\nOn April 10, TSM unveiled impressive revenue figures for March, marking the highest month-over-month growth since November 2022 at 34.3% year-over-year, totaling 195.2 billion New Taiwan dollars (approximately $6.1 billion). Additionally, Q1 revenues are projected to increase by 16.5% year-over-year, reaching 592.6 billion New Taiwan dollars (around $18.4 billion).\n\nIt’s worth noting that TSM anticipates mid-20% revenue growth for FY 2024, fueled by strong demand for its latest nano chips amid the AI surge. Moreover, the company reaffirmed in January 2024 that its AI revenues are growing rapidly at approximately 50% annually. This reaffirmation is particularly reassuring following the revenue decline reported in 2023.\n\nTSM manufactures the chips and supplies them to tech titans like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Ahead of its Q1 earnings release expected on April 18, let’s take a look at what the future holds for TSM.\n\nAI Revolution Will Spur Growth at TSM\n\nThe AI revolution has taken the world by storm. I firmly believe that its growth trajectory is enduring. The AI industry, still in its infancy, is projected to witness remarkable expansion across diverse industries and applications. According to Next Move Strategy Consulting, the industry is anticipated to burgeon into a $1.85 trillion behemoth by 2030, compared to around $208 billion in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSM’s customers heavily rely on the company for the production of chips they design. An uproar in demand for everything AI has led to a huge demand for AI chips.\n\nTo add to the AI growth spurt, TSM got yet another boost to its manufacturing operations, as it received approval for direct federal funding worth $11.6 billion under the U.S. government’s CHIPS Act. The company will receive $6.6 billion in grants to expand its manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition, TSM is eligible for an incremental loan of $5 billion.\n\nTSM has already invested in building two plants at the site and will use the funding to build an additional factory. The firm’s total investment across all three factories is estimated at $65 billion. This marks the “largest foreign direct investments in a greenfield project in U.S. history,” according to the press release.\n\nTSM plans to produce 2-nanometer technology chips at the second factory starting in 2028. In the coming years, TSM should reap the benefits of massive investments that will greatly enhance its manufacturing operations and bring in the latest technological advancements.\n\nSharing his optimism, TSM Chairman Mark Liu stated, “Our U.S. operations allow us to better support our U.S. customers, which include several of the world’s leading technology companies. Our U.S. operations will also expand our capability to trailblaze future advancements in semiconductor technology.”\n\nTo date, the majority of TSM’s manufacturing capabilities are based in Taiwan, which poses a geographical risk (potential threat of Chinese invasion, earthquakes, etc.). With the latest expansion announcement, that risk will be alleviated. With increased manufacturing in the U.S., TSM will likely more efficiently cater to its top-notch clients like Nvidia, AMD, and Apple based in the U.S. On top of that, record-high crypto prices are creating higher demand for chips, adding to TSM’s growth outlook.\n\nTSM Is Trading at a Cheap Valuation\n\nIn terms of its valuation, TSM looks cheap. Currently, it’s trading at an attractive forward P/E ratio of 23x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices is trading at a higher forward P/E multiple (49x), while the AI prodigy Nvidia is trading at a forward P/E of 36.4x.\n\nWall Street analysts expect TSM’s EPS to reach $9.02 in FY 2026. If TSM keeps the same forward P/E multiple by then, its share price will be about $207, 45% higher than the current price. Therefore, it makes sense to consider buying TSM stock at current levels, given the strong growth potential in the AI space.\n\nIs TSM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on eight unanimous Buys. TSM stock’s average price target of $154.14 implies 8.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: TSM Presents a Strong Opportunity for Long-Term Growth\n\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant surge, largely driven by the AI boom. TSM, along with its AI-focused counterparts, stands to gain from this relentless demand. With strategic investments and expansion plans in place to meet future demands, TSM appears well-positioned for sustained growth. Considering these factors, I am inclined to buy the stock at its current levels, anticipating long-term benefits from its AI potential.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "The collective of leading technology companies, often referred to as the Magnificent Seven, has seen an increase in their dominance within the S&P 500 Index, despite not all members performing to expectations. This group, which includes some of the most influential names in the tech industry, has expanded its share of the index, now representing nearly a third of its value, surpassing several other major sectors combined.\n\nEven with varied performance among its members, this tech ensemble has reached a new peak in its contribution to the benchmark index. This rise is attributed to the remarkable gains of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which soared by approximately 81% due to the high demand for its AI computing chips. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have also seen significant increases in their stock values, with jumps of 47% and 24%, respectively. Both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have surpassed the overall S&P 500's performance, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) experienced a decline of about 9%.\n\nConversely, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has seen its shares decrease by around 30% this year, as the electric vehicle manufacturer grapples with slowing demand and investor uncertainty regarding its recovery prospects.\n\nThese tech giants' growing influence within the S&P 500 underscores the significant impact the technology sector has on the broader market, even as individual companies within the group experience varying degrees of success.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Apple Signal of AI Intent Unleashes $112 Billion Stock Surge",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stock market has punished Apple Inc. this year for failing to offer a vision of where its future growth will come from. The shares caught a bid Thursday after the tech giant took a step toward providing an answer.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIsrael Bracing for Unprecedented Direct Iran Attack in Days Apple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips Russian Attacks on Ukraine Stoke Fears Army Near Breaking Point US Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies Stocks Get Hit as War Jitters Fuel Rush to Bonds: Markets Wrap\n\nApple’s decision to overhaul its Mac computer line to focus on artificial intelligence, as reported by Bloomberg, struck a chord with investors, sending the stock up 4.3% and adding $112 billion in value in its best performance in nearly a year.\n\n“Any announcement that pushes AI into consumer hardware could be very beneficial for Apple,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “However, the impact is yet to be determined.”\n\nThat will be key for assessing whether this latest rally can be sustained. Before Thursday’s announcement, the stock was down 15% from its record high set in December, wiping out more than $460 billion in market value. Trading close to its cheapest level in about a year, bargain-hunters clearly could justify taking a chance on Apple’s latest stab at AI relevance.\n\nSustaining this momentum, however, will depend on Apple’s ability to deliver on the promise of growth. For the Cupertino, California-based tech giant, that likely means getting AI into the iPhone.\n\nThe stock gained 0.5% on Friday.\n\nTrading at Discount\n\n“We think Apple will come back,” said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management market research and strategy team. “It is hard to bet against some of the perennial winners forever.”\n\nApple has paid mightily for its recent stagnation. It’s one of the weakest performers among the so-called Magnificent Seven this year, trailing only Tesla Inc. That has made it relatively cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock trades at 26 times earnings, a discount to megacap peers such as Microsoft Corp. It’s less expensive than the Nasdaq 100 benchmark, which has an average multiple of 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe underperformance reflects the lack of a defined AI strategy and several quarters of weak trends, despite the company’s strong financial position and proven revenue generation.\n\n“It has all these defensive qualities, like its cash flow, balance sheet and buybacks,” said Skelly. “It will start outlining more clarity and visibility around its AI pipeline, and while it may not be this year, expectations are building for an AI-enabled iPhone. In other words, it is becoming increasingly attractive.”\n\nHedge Fund Enthusiasm\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. sees rising enthusiasm for Apple among hedge fund investors, as its reduced valuation and AI tailwinds offset challenges in China and the company’s services business.\n\nHedge funds are eyeing the headwinds for an entry point while “increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle,” according to JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, who has an outperform rating on the stock, in a recent note.\n\nThe broader hope for Apple investors is that AI will be the catalyst that spurs a re-acceleration of growth. Margins are tight as revenue has declined in four of the past five quarters, and analysts expect sales to contract by 4.6% in its second-quarter results, which will be released in coming weeks. While this represents some of Apple’s weakest growth in decades, the upside is revenue is expected to gradually rebound later this year.\n\n“Investors have historically underestimated Apple’s gross margins and it appears that it is happening again,” Bank of America Corp. analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients. “We see gross margins at Apple headed significantly higher, driven by increased mix of services within the overall portfolio,” he added.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe Magnificent Seven group of tech stocks have become even bigger relative to the rest of the S&P 500 Index. The group hit a record weighting in the benchmark on Thursday amid a broad rally in technology shares — despite poor performances this year from Apple and Tesla Inc.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nBeijing has ordered telecom carriers like China Mobile Ltd. to replace foreign chips in their core networks by 2027, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Samsung Electronics Co. is preparing to take the wraps off a $44 billion investment in US chipmaking as soon as next week, a signature project in Washington’s broader effort to bring semiconductor production back to America. Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management has announced that it holds a stake in Silicon Valley artificial intelligence darling OpenAI, a bet that the nascent AI industry will remake the tech landscape. Chinese regulators are zeroing in on one of the country’s most prominent AI and computing firms, after a probe uncovered how the chairman’s wife secretly traded 150 million yuan ($21 million) of company stock during a year-long mega-rally. After more than a year of slowing sales, India’s software-services companies that power corporations ranging from global banks to retailers to planemakers may finally be seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai Race for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers Cocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the Bean Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Should You Invest in Apple (AAPL) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Apple (AAPL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.80 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 10.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Apple, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AAPL a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Apple, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $6.55.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Apple.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Trending tickers: BP, Gold, Samsung, Apple",
        "content": "BP shares rose on Friday (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nBP was one of the top risers on Friday morning, up as much as 2.8% to their highest level since October, after Reuters reported that Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) had considered launching a takeover bid for the UK firm.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company has spoken directly to BP in recent months, and sought advice from investment banks on a potential deal, according to sources.\n\nHowever, deliberations did not get any further than preliminary discussions after Adnoc said BP was not the right fit for its strategy. The company was also concerned about the politics of any bid.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Emirati company considered all options when looking at BP, including buying a big stake, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nRead more: UK economy grows slightly in February\n\nAdnoc has been pursuing a series of European assets. Last year it made a non-binding bid of around €11.3bn (£9.6bn, £12bn) to acquire German plastics and chemicals maker Covestro. It has also been in talks with Austria’s OMV to create a chemicals group with combined annual sales of more than $20bn (£16bn).\n\nIn December last year, it also agreed to buy European chemical producer OCI's stake in ammonia and urea producer Fertiglobe for $3.6bn.\n\nAdnoc currently supports BP’s hydrogen production project in Teesside, while last year the firms joined forces on a $2bn venture to buy 50% of Israeli gas company NewMed. But this deal was suspended in March due to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nIt comes as British companies have attracted a number of foreign takeovers due to depressed values on London’s stock market.\n\nGold (GC=F)\n\nGold prices surged to fresh highs on Friday, with the safe-haven asset breaching the $2,400 threshold for the first time. This was due to a potential escalation in the tensions between Israel and Iran.\n\nMeanwhile silver traded at the highest since February 2021. Gold has surged higher this year, dragging silver along with it as central banks including China’s stepped up purchases of the precious metal.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt comes as Israel is preparing for an expected assault from Iran in the next two days. This is in retaliation for its strike on the country’s diplomatic compound in Syria last week, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nRicardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, said: “As rhetoric between the two adversarial powers grows increasingly belligerent, the allure of haven assets intensifies, with investors bracing for a conflict fraught with significant geopolitical and economic ramifications.\"\n\n“The ascent of gold prices is especially noteworthy against the backdrop of a strengthening dollar and the uptick in treasury yields, spurred by US consumer and producer prices surpassing expectations and consequently delaying the anticipated timing of the Federal Reserve's inaugural rate cut from June to November.”\n\nHe added: “Given these prevailing conditions, the trajectory for gold prices appears poised for further upside.”\n\nPlatinum and palladium also advanced as the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index traded near the highest level since November.\n\nSamsung (005930.KS)\n\nSamsung slipped 0.5% overnight as it prepares to unveil a $44bn investment in US chipmaking as soon as next week.\n\nThe world’s largest chipmaker is set to outline the project in Texas alongside commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nHowever, the timing and details of the announcement could still change before they are finalised, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSamsung has reportedly secured more than $6bn of government grants, with the investment expected to total $44bn over multiple years.\n\nIt comes as Joe Biden’s administration aims to challenge the technological rise of China, and revitalise US chipmaking after decades of production shifting to Asia.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple rose 4% in New York last night after news that it is planning a Mac line overhaul with AI-focused M4 chips\n\nThe company is aiming to release the updated computers later this year and early 2025, including new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis.\n\nBloomberg reported that Apple is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the new chips, and how they'll integrate with the next version of macOS.\n\nMeanwhile, according to JP Morgan, the firm is is drawing interest from hedge fund investors seeing potential for AI-linked upgrades to its iPhones.\n\n“Hedge fund investors are increasingly warming up to the opportunity of the AI upgrade cycle,” although questions remain around whether that will kick in with iPhones to be introduced later this year or in 2025, analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a research note Thursday.\n\nChatterjee added: \"Hedge funds are eyeing the headwinds to create more tactical entry point ahead of the AI upgrade cycle.”\n\nIt comes as Apple's shares have fallen as much as 13% this year thanks to weak sales in China.\n\nWatch: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup report earnings<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPM?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">JPM</a>), Wells Fargo (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WFC?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">WFC</a>), and Citigroup (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/C?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">C</a>).

        "content": "(Adds context in paragraphs 9-10)\n\nBy Sam Tobin and Martin Coulter\n\nLONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Apple's bid to dismiss a lawsuit valued at nearly $1 billion was rejected on Friday, with a judge ruling it must face allegations it charged more than 1,500 UK-based developers unfair commission fees on purchases of apps and other content.\n\nSean Ennis, a competition law professor and economist, is spearheading the case, which was filed at London's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year and alleges Apple charged developers unfair commissions of up to 30%.\n\nLawyers for Ennis say the U.S. tech giant abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of apps on iPhones and other Apple devices and are seeking damages.\n\nApple has faced mounting pressure from regulators in the U.S. and Europe over the fees it charges third-party developers distributing apps via the App Store. The company says 85% of developers on its App Store do not pay any commission at all.\n\nIn the European Union, new laws have forced Apple to allow users to download apps from rival sources, including websites and alternative app stores. Meanwhile in the U.S., it made changes to its App Store following a long-running legal battle with Epic Games, the company behind \"Fortnite\".\n\nApple's lawyer Daniel Piccinin argued at a hearing in January that developers cannot have a claim in the UK unless they were charged on purchases made through the UK App Store.\n\nBut Apple's bid to throw out that part of the case was rejected by Judge Andrew Lenon in a written ruling on Friday.\n\nLenon said that Ennis' lawyers had a realistic prospect of establishing that \"Apple's overcharging of commission to app developers based in the UK in relation to commerce transacted on non-UK storefronts did amount to conduct implemented in the UK\".\n\nApple is also facing a separate case over allegedly defective iPhone batteries on behalf of around 24 million iPhone users, which was certified last year.\n\nThe company is contesting both cases, which are not expected to come to trial before 2025.

        "title": "3 Giant Tech Stocks to Buy in April and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks breaks down where the stock market stands as Wall Street turns its attention from March inflation data to Q1 earnings. Some major tech names outside of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and the other superstars are set to report during the early weeks of earnings season. We dive into why investors might want to consider buying Netflix (NFLX), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) ahead of their upcoming earnings releases.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell below their 21-day moving averages again mid-week after the ‘hot’ March inflation report. Many started beating the bearish drum, declaring that the larger pullback was finally at hand.\n\nThe bulls quickly proved Thursday they aren’t ready to concede more ground. Apple and Nvidia stock soared on Thursday and Amazon and Alphabet made fresh all-time highs. These are hardly signals that the bears are on the verge of clawing into the driver’s seat.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) – Q1 Results on April 18\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor transformed into one of the most important companies on the planet by focusing exclusively on chip manufacturing. TSMC is poised to grow for decades as it physically builds the bedrock of all technology, from data centers to AI and the still to come. Taiwan Semi’s clients include Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and tons of other tech giants. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTaiwan Semi is almost peerless having built a massive moat at the bleeding edge of chip manufacturing. TSMC dominates advanced global chip manufacturing and it is expanding its manufacturing footprint beyond Taiwan amid geopolitical tensions.\n\nTSMC averaged 18% revenue growth between FY18 and FY22. The firm topped Q4 FY23 EPS estimates and provided upbeat guidance, “supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology.”\n\nTaiwan Semi is projected to grow its sales by 23% in FY24 and 20% in FY25, following a cyclical down year in 2023. Taiwan Semi’s adjusted earnings are projected to climb by 19% and 24%, respectively.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTSM shares soared 610% in the last decade to double the tech sector, and it surged to new all-time highs in March. Taiwan Semi trades at a 15% discount to tech at 22.3X forward 12-month earnings and 35% below its 10-year highs. Taiwan Semi pays a dividend and it has a strong balance sheet.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) – Q1 Results on April 18\n\nNetflix has recaptured Wall Street’s admiration by addressing many of investors’ biggest concerns. The firm’s lower-price ad-supported tier and its crackdown on excessive account sharing are driving growth. The company that transformed entertainment forever has remained at the top of the pile even as Disney, Apple, Amazon, and countless others pour money into streaming, fueled by an array of original content and new efforts such as live sports. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe firm posted blowout Q4 results, adding 13.1 million net new paid subscribers to beat Wall Street estimates by 50%. NFLX hit 260.28 million total paid subscribers to blow away Disney. Netflix is projected to grow its sales by 15% in FY24 and another 12% next year to boost its adjusted earnings by 42% and 23%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix stock is up 1,200% in the last 10 years vs. tech’s 300%. NFLX has climbed around 240% off its lows and 27% YTD, yet it trades 10% below its peaks. The stock is trying to find support at its 21-day moving average right now. The streaming stock trades at a 90% discount to its all-time highs at 34X forward earnings and 50% below its median.\n\nCadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS) – Q1 Results on April 22\n\nCadence’s modeling and computational software help companies design chips and other vital technologies, enabling Nvidia and others to simulate semiconductors before they are made. The growing complexity of semiconductors needed for AI, hyperscale computing, and beyond helped transformed Cadence into an invaluable partner for many and a vital part of the chip ecosystem.\n\nCadence provides investors the chance to buy into the booming world of AI and semiconductors. More importantly, Cadence is poised to benefit from AI expansion and beyond no matter who the near-term and long-term winners are. Cadence is one of the few major players in the vital electronic design automation world. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCadence ended 2023 with a record backlog and a deeper partnership with the likes of Nvidia and Arm. Cadence is set to grow its sales by 12% in FY24 and 13% in FY25 to help boost its adjusted EPS by 15% and 18%, respectively.\n\nCadence stock is up 2,000% in the last 10 years to blow away Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. The stock is also up 45% in the last 12 months, with it trying to find support at its 50-day.\n\nCadence is hardly a value stock, trading at 60X forward 12-month earnings vs. Tech’s 26X. That said, CDNS trades at a 17% discount to its five-year highs and not too far above its median, highlighting that Wall Street has been very willing to pay up for Cadence’s long-term growth outlook.\n\n[Disclosure: Ben Rains owns TSM.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., aiming to boost sluggish computer sales, is preparing to overhaul its entire Mac line with a new family of in-house processors designed to highlight artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies Vietnam Tycoon Lan Sentenced to Death Over $12 Billion Fraud Apple Plans to Overhaul Entire Mac Line With AI-Focused M4 Chips US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Russia Destroys Largest Power Plant in Ukraine’s Kyiv Region\n\nThe company, which released its first Macs with M3 chips five months ago, is already nearing production of the next generation — the M4 processor — according to people with knowledge of the matter. The new chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple is looking to update every Mac model with it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven’t been announced.\n\nThe new Macs are underway at a critical time. After peaking in 2022, Mac sales fell 27% in the last fiscal year, which ended in September. In the holiday period, revenue from the computer line was flat. Apple attempted to breathe new life into the Mac business with an M3-focused launch event last October, but those chips didn’t bring major performance improvements over the M2 from the prior year.\n\nApple also is playing catch-up in AI, where it’s seen as a laggard to Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and other tech peers. The new chips are part of a broader push to weave AI capabilities into all its products.\n\nApple is aiming to release the updated computers beginning late this year and extending into early next year. There will be new iMacs, a low-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, high-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, and Mac minis — all with M4 chips. But the company’s plans could change. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nApple shares climbed 4.3% to $175.04 on Thursday in New York, the biggest single-day gain in 11 months. They had been down 13% this year through Wednesday’s close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move will mark a quick refresh schedule for the iMac and MacBook Pro, as both lines were just updated in October. The Mac mini was last upgraded in January 2023.\n\nApple is then planning to follow up with more M4 Macs throughout 2025. That includes updates to the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air by the spring, the Mac Studio around the middle of the year, and the Mac Pro later in 2025. The MacBook Air received the M3 chip last month, while the Mac Studio and Mac Pro were updated with M2 processors last year.\n\nThe M4 chip line includes an entry-level version dubbed Donan, more powerful models named Brava and a top-end processor codenamed Hidra. The company is planning to highlight the AI processing capabilities of the components and how they’ll integrate with the next version of macOS, which will be announced in June at Apple’s annual developer conference.\n\nRead More: Apple Set to Unveil AI Strategy at June 10 Developers Conference\n\nThe Donan chip is coming to the entry-level MacBook Pro, the new MacBook Airs and a low-end version of the Mac mini, while the Brava chips will run the high-end MacBook Pros and a pricier version of the Mac mini. For the Mac Studio, Apple is testing versions with both a still-unreleased M3-era chip and a variation of the M4 Brava processor.\n\nThe highest-end Apple desktop, the Mac Pro, is set to get the new Hidra chip. The Mac Pro remains the lower-selling model in the company’s computer lineup, but it has a vocal fan base. After some customers complained about the specifications of Apple’s in-house chips, the company is looking to beef up that machine next year.\n\nAs part of the upgrades, Apple is considering allowing its highest-end Mac desktops to support as much as a half-terabyte of memory. The current Mac Studio and Mac Pro top out at 192 gigabytes — far less capacity than on Apple’s previous Mac Pro, which used an Intel Corp. processor. The earlier machine worked with off-the-shelf memory that could be added later and handle as much as 1.5 terabytes. With Apple’s in-house chips, the memory is more deeply integrated into the main processor, making it harder to add more.\n\nThe big focus for Apple this year is to add new artificial intelligence features across its products. The company is planning to preview a slew of new features at its June developer conference. A large swath of those features are designed to run on the devices themselves — rather than in remote servers — and speedier chips will help drive those enhancements. Apple is also planning to make AI-focused upgrades to this year’s iPhone processor.\n\nThe company’s switch to in-house chips was part of a long-running initiative known as Apple Silicon. The tech giant started using its own semiconductors in the original iPad and iPhone 4 in 2010, before bringing the technology to the Mac in 2020. The goal has been to better unify its hardware and software with underlying components and move away from processors made by Intel.\n\nSo far, the effort has been a success, helping boost performance and ease the redesign of devices such as the latest MacBook Air, iMac and MacBook Pro. Apple’s Mac chips are based on the same underlying Arm Holdings Plc architecture as the processors in the iPhone and iPad, enabling thinner products with better battery life and less need for cooling fans.\n\n(Updates Apple shares in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and Hyundai Race for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data Centers Cocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the Bean Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "title": "Apple’s Services business is a bright spot in the company’s rough 2024: BofA",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) 2024 has been rough so far. But despite the company’s headwinds ranging from antitrust suits to slowing iPhone sales, there’s one big bright spot for Apple: its Services business. In the first quarter, Services revenue jumped 11% year over year to $6.3 billion.\n\nAnd according to BofA Global Research’s Wamsi Mohan, Apple is set to report another quarter of double-digit growth for the segment when it announces its second quarter earnings later this month.\n\nApple’s Services business includes the company’s App Store sales, advertising revenue, AppleCare+, subscription services like Apple TV+, and more. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, App Store revenue grew 11% in the first quarter of the year, up from 3% in the first quarter of 2023 and 5% in Q1 2022.\n\nApple’s App Store also appears to be surviving the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) without much issue. The legislation, which went into effect in March, forces both Apple and Google to allow consumers to download and install third-party app stores and notify users that they can switch to third-party web browsers.\n\nSensor Tower data indicates that while App Store in-app spending grew 13% globally in March, it increased 28% in the EU. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures during the inauguration of India's first Apple retail store in Mumbai, India, April 18, 2023. (Francis Mascarenhas/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n“Although the DMA has been in effect for roughly one month, it appears there has been no significant impact to Apple’s revenue from in-app purchases (or subscriptions),” the firm stated.\n\nAccording to Reuters, EU-based user numbers for third-party browsers like Aloha increased 250% in March.\n\nBut with more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices in circulation, the company isn’t likely to face much of an impact from third-party browser installs. In fact, according to Mohan, App Store installs in the EU have increased 2% year over year since the DMA went into effect, while revenue rose 24%.\n\nThat said, Apple also requires app developers that offer apps via third-party app stores to pay a 50-euro cent \"core technology\" fee for each app users install after the first million installs. Apple says the fee is necessary to maintain app security and upkeep, but the European Union's antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, is looking into whether Apple is violating the terms of the DMA.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor now, however, Apple’s Services business continues to perform well at a time when the company’s other segments are facing declining revenue. In Q1, Apple reported an 11% drop in its Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, while its iPad business revenue plummeted 25% in the quarter.\n\nAnd while iPhone sales increased 6% year over year in Q1, they declined 13% in China, Apple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe. Part of that problem has to do with China’s tepid economic environment, but the company is also contending with a resurgent Huawei as well as other home-grown smartphone makers stealing away market share.\n\nApple’s iPad business is also facing difficulties, with revenue declining 3% in 2023 and 8% in 2022. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOn the legal front, the Department of Justice is suing Apple for allegedly stymying competition in the smartphone space. The European Union has also fined the company $2 billion over antitrust concerns related to music streaming services.\n\nWe’ll find out more about Apple’s performance in the quarter when it reports its fiscal Q2 results May 2.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "All-Time High Flyers: 7 Stocks to Buy as the Market Peaks",
        "content": "If you’re wondering which stocks to buy in April, here’s a good place to start. The stock market is off to a difficult start in the second quarter. With the timing of interest rates getting pushed out further, the major averages have turned downwards. Since peaking on March 28, the benchmark S&P 500 index has declined nearly 2%. The dip has some on Wall Street wondering aloud if we’re at or close to the market’s peak and now entering what could be a steep selloff. Many analysts say a pullback is overdue with all three major stock indices hitting all-time highs throughout the first quarter.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained more than 25% from the end of October through the end of March, which is quite a strong rally. Stocks in certain sectors rallied particularly hard, notably artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors, cybersecurity, and weight-loss medications. But much of the rally was predicated on expectations for lower interest rates, the timing of which has been thrown into doubt with inflation remaining high and the economy showing resilience. Here are all-time high flyers: seven stocks to buy as the market peaks.\n\nStocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to assert its dominance in AI and its stock has been responding. In the last 12 months, MSFT stock has increased nearly 50%, including a 15% increase this year. The company and its stock continue to be viewed as one of the best ways to play the bull market in AI that is helping to push the stock market to record highs. Recently, Microsoft further expanded its global reach in AI, announcing an investment of $2.90 billion to enhance its AI business in Japan.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe money, which represents Microsoft’s biggest ever investment in Japan, will go towards the development of advanced AI semiconductors at two facilities in the Asian nation. Microsoft also plans to allocate funds towards an AI reskilling program in Japan that will see three million workers trained on the technology. And, the company plans to establish a new AI lab in Tokyo for research and development on robotics and machine learning. This is just the latest example of how Microsoft is staying ahead in the AI race.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) Coinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn addition to AI, another major catalyst for the market continues to be cryptocurrencies. And one of the best ways to play the boom in crypto is to own shares of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Shares of the cryptocurrency exchange have been white hot amid the rise in crypto prices. In the last 12 months, COIN stock has risen 277%. Already in 2024, the company’s share price has gained 60%. Despite the big rally, analysts see more upside ahead for Coinbase and its shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Wall Street firm Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) recently raised their price target on COIN stock to $276 from $200 and reiterated a “buy” rating on the shares. The price target is 11% higher than where Coinbase’s stock currently trades. In a research note, Oppenheimer said that Coinbase is likely to benefit from the long-term adoption of blockchain technology. The brokerage also raised its earning estimates for Coinbase.\n\nThe analyst upgrade comes as Coinbase announced that it has received regulatory approval to begin operating its cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. Coinbase, which is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has now become the biggest crypto trading platform north of the border.\n\nStocks to Buy: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nNo corner of the market is hotter right now than semiconductor stocks. Microchips and semiconductors are viewed as the key to unlocking the potential of AI, fueling a huge rally. And among chip and semi stocks, one of the best to own is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM), commonly known as TSMC. The Taiwanese company currently manufacturers more than half (50%) of all the microchips in the world, with some estimates putting its market share as high as 60%.\n\nThe dominance of TSMC when it comes to making microchips and semiconductors for third parties such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has pushed its share price sharply higher. Through 12 months, TSM stock is up 62% and currently trading near its all-time high. The company and stock just got a boost from news that the U.S. government is giving it $6.60 billion to help fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona.\n\nThe government funding is coming from the U.S. CHIPS Act that aims to increase America’s chip security and lessen the country’s reliance on foreign made microchips and semiconductors. TSMC is spending about $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix, Arizona. In announcing the funding, the U.S. government said that TSMC’s Arizona plants have already created more than 25,000 jobs and attracted 14 semiconductor suppliers to the southwestern state.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow that General Electric has successfully divided itself into three publicly traded companies, it might be an opportune time to invest in GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), which retains the company’s original industrial business, including its aircraft engine manufacturing unit. Not only has GE stock doubled in the past 12 months as the company hived itself into three, but GE Aerospace just announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by an astounding 250%.\n\nGoing forward, GE Aerospace will pay a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share, up from eight cents previously. Last fall, management outlined plans to return 75% of the company’s free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks once the dust settled on the three-way split. GE Aerospace has said that it expects to generate more than $5 billion of free cash flow this year, which could lead to windfall for current and future shareholders. This makes GE Aerospace a stock to buy as the market peaks.\n\nStocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a buy-the-dip candidate. Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has seen its stock decline 5% so far in 2024. Through 12 months, the company’s share price is down 7%. Now might be the time to buy JNJ stock as the company continues to grow through an acquisition strategy. Johnson & Johnson has just announced that it is buying Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ:SWAV) for $13.10 billion as it grows its treatments for heart disease and other pulmonary ailments.\n\nThe purchase of Shockwave Medical is the largest by Johnson & Johnson since its $16.60 billion acquisition of heart pump maker Abiomed in 2022. Shockwave Medical specializes in medical devices that use shockwaves to break down calcified plaque in heart vessels. It’s a process that is similar to how kidney stones are broken apart and removed. Under terms of the deal, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay $335 per share in cash to acquire Shockwave Medical. The acquisition is expected to close this summer.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nAnother stock that looks like a deal at current levels is United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The company’s stock is also down 5% this year and looks cheap right now trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and with a quarterly dividend that yields 4.34%. Like the other names on this list, goods things are happening at United Parcel Service with catalysts that are likely to send UPS stock higher in the coming months.\n\nSpecifically, United Parcel Service has just struck a deal to become the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service, replacing archrival Federal Express (NYSE:FDX). FedEx previously had the air cargo contract with the U.S. Postal Service for 22 years and earned $1.73 billion from it in 2023. The contract with the U.S. Postal Service now switches to United Parcel Service in September of this year and will give its earnings a boost going forward. UPS stock has declined 21% over the last year.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn healthcare, nothing is working right now quite as well as weight-loss drugs. And Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is leading in this area with its in-demand medications Ozempic and Wegovy. Sales of the weight-loss drugs are rising fast, sending NVO stock higher as a result. Over the past 12 months, Novo Nordisk’s share price has gained 57%, including a 22% increase so far in 2024. The growth has made Novo Nordisk one of Europe’s largest publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of nearly half a trillion dollars.\n\nEven with the growth from the weight-loss drugs, the Danish pharmaceutical giant isn’t sitting idle. Novo Nordisk has announced that it is buying privately held Cardior Pharmaceuticals for $1.10 billion. The acquisition strengthens Novo Nordisk’s pipeline of cardiovascular medications. The company has said that it is expanding its diabetes and weight-loss drugs to also include cardiovascular and heart treatments.\n\nThe acquisition includes Cardior Pharmaceuticals’ lead compound CDR132L that is in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. The purchase of Cardior is expected to close in the current second quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, AAPL and MSFT.

        "title": "3 Fantastic Growth Stocks That Have Turned $10,000 Into $3 Million in 20 Years",
        "content": "Investing in top growth stocks can not only make you a millionaire, but a multimillionaire. And in some cases, you can achieve those kinds of results by investing just $10,000. Three examples of fantastic long-term investments over the past 20 years are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). These stocks have turned $10,000 investments into more than $3 million today. Here's how they've done it, and whether they are still good stocks to own today.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nChipmaker Nvidia has taken off in value over the past few years as investors have grown excited about the company's long-term prospects in artificial intelligence (AI). Whether it's creating chatbots or new AI models, Nvidia has become synonymous with AI investing. Many top tech companies have partnered with it as there's no shortage of customers eager to buy Nvidia's chips.\n\nTwo decades ago, this was still a big name in the computing world, and if you had invested $10,000 in the stock in April 2004, your investment would top $4 million right now. That's an amazing return, but it's hard, if not impossible, to predict winners like this.\n\nWhile you would be unlikely to generate returns like that from Nvidia if you bought the stock today, it can still be an excellent investment, nonetheless. In the trailing 12 months, the company has accumulated $30 billion in profits on revenues of $61 billion for an impressive profit margin of just under 50%.\n\nThe stock's relatively low price/earnings-to-growth ratio, or PEG, of 1.2 also implies that analysts still see a lot more growth from the business down the road, and that the market may not be necessarily overvaluing the stock currently. If you're bullish on AI, it's hard to go wrong with Nvidia, even if you're buying the stock today.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple, the popular iPhone and iPad maker, has enjoyed a long and illustrious growth trajectory over the years. The business has evolved, and today has created a whole ecosystem that revolves around its products and related services. That can make acquiring a user particularly powerful, since the prospect of switching to an Android phone can be both costly and cumbersome.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough this year hasn't been a particularly strong one for Apple with its shares down 12% thus far in 2024, it has still been an exceptional stock to have owned over the long term. If you invested $10,000 into the stock 20 years ago, your investment would be worth approximately $3.5 million today, and about $4.1 million with dividends reinvested.\n\nApple is another example of a high-margin business as over the past four quarters, its net income has totaled $100.9 billion, which is 26% of its top line during that stretch ($385.7 billion). Now that the stock is taking a bit of a breather, investors may want to consider loading up on Apple's stock as it trades at 26 times earnings, which may not prove to be all that high for a business that still has a top brand and plenty of room to grow its revenue, particularly on the service side of things.\n\n3. Monster Beverage\n\nEnergy drink company Monster Beverage has built up a strong brand for decades. The company has been growing globally, and today it's a top beverage brand. It has partnered with the Ultimate Fighting Championship as key deals like that have helped Monster's brand become synonymous with high performance and athleticism.\n\nThe business is much smaller than the others on this list, generating revenue of just over $7.1 billion last year. But with strong profits of $1.6 billion, its profit margins have also been high at around 23%.\n\nOne thing that hasn't been modest has been the profit long-term investors would have accumulated from owning the stock. Like with Apple, a $10,000 investment in Monster's stock 20 years ago would have grown to a value of nearly $3.5 million today.\n\nAt 35.2 times its trailing earnings, however, the stock may be getting a bit pricey as its sales rose by just 13% last year, though earnings per share (EPS) rose by 38%, somewhat justifying the market's expectations. While Monster has historically been a good buy over the years, its future gains may be a bit more muted compared with the other stocks on this list. Monster can still make for a good investment, but investors should be careful not to expect sky-high returns just because of its past performance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks Wall Street Is Ignoring (But You Shouldn’t): April Edition",
        "content": "If you think about it, many of today’s high-flying stocks were once ignored by the Street. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a struggling video-game chip maker, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was a fledgling online book seller and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a formerly successful PC maker, fighting to stay in business. Indeed, the Street tends to shun stocks with great potential that are not yet delivering huge revenue gains or impressive partnerships. Therefore, it’s certainly worthwhile for long-term investors to consider buying stocks that are largely being shunned by the most popular business-news pundits and the largest investors. Here are three such overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nEisai (ESAIY) medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stock\n\nSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Street is still not enthusiastic about Japanese drug maker Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESAIY), co-owner of the first-ever Alzheimer’s treatment, Leqembi, that has shown a significant amount of effectiveness.\n\nAccording to data reported late last year, 60% of a small group of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients who received the drug meaningfully improved. Among a larger group of patients with varied stages of the disease, cognitive decline was slowed by 27%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor a variety of logistics-related reasons, the uptake of the drug has been slower than expected. Neurologists have been unenthusiastic about the treatment. Insurers’ reluctance and IV-only delivery likely explains physicians’ reticence.\n\nThankfully, Eisai has begun seeking FDA approval for a subcutaneous version of Leqembi which should ease the drug’s administration. Additionally, Eisai’s U.S. partner, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), is reportedly working to increase insurance coverage of the treatment.\n\nIn spite of the problems, Eisai predicts that the drug will generate almost $2 billion in sales by fiscal year 2027 and $8 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2031.\n\nEntain (GMVHY) sports betting stocks man celebrating winning bet on match, bookmaker app\n\nSource: Motortion Films / Shutterstock.com\n\nEntain (OTCMKTS:GMVHY), a UK-based online betting giant, delivered strong financial results in 2023. It also may greatly benefit from selling a stake in a joint venture to MGM (NYSE:MGM) and could itself become a takeover target.\n\nLast year, Entain’s revenue climbed 11% to 4.77 billion British pounds, while its operating profit, excluding certain items, jumped 18% to 641.8 million British pounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Entain and MGM’s joint venture, BetMGM, rose 36% last year, and the joint venture generated positive EBITDA in the second half of the year. BetMGM’s revenue and EBITDA are likely to climb tremendously as the platform expands to more states and as the popularity of online betting spreads in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have been rumors that MGM would look to buy Entain’s stake in BetMGM. If that does occur, Entain would likely have several billion dollars of cash that it could return to shareholders or use to acquire a profitable firm.\n\nFurther, the London Times recently reported that private equity firms are interested in buying Entain. If that occurs, of course, the company’s shares would soar.\n\nAll of Entain’s positive catalysts make it one of the best overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nStem (STEM) Conceptual background of artificial intelligence, humans and cyber-business on programming technology element, 3D illustration. Next trillion-dollar companies. top AI stocks billionaires buy\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nStem’s (NYSE:STEM) AI-powered software maximizes the efficiency of electricity use. The electrification of transportation and the rapid proliferation of AI should cause Stem’s software demand to surge going forward.\n\nStem recently launched PowerBidder Pro to help energy traders and asset owners optimize their asset bids and manage risk. It also enables them, using AI, to predict their energy usage. The product appears to be geared to the owners of energy storage batteries, a sector that’s rapidly growing in America.\n\nEncouragingly, Stem already obtained a major customer and leading independent energy and commodity group,Mercuria, for PowerBidder Pro. Mercuria’s decision to purchase the product so soon after its launch bodes well for its outlook.\n\nStem expects to generate $50 million of cash this year, making it a prime choice among overlooked stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in STEM, ESAIY and MGM.

        "title": "Time may be on your side, but not if you're always after the latest hot stock",
        "content": "Black Friday Shoppers in Berlin as Germany’s Third Quarter Economy Stronger Than Expected\n\nTime is on my side, yes it is Time is on my side, yes it is Now you always say That you want to be free But you’ll come running back (said you would baby) You’ll come running back (I said so many times before) You’ll come running back to me\n\n~ The Rolling Stones\n\nThe Rolling Stones’ iconic Time Is On My Side is a testament to the power of patience. Its lyrics remind listeners that even though things can seem challenging, everything will eventually fall into place. But this is increasingly ringing hollow with many investors.\n\nDiscipline is one of the most important principles for successful, long-term investors, who tend to stick to their knitting, even during times when this entails avoiding hot stocks and underperforming over the short or medium term.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut even the most disciplined investors have their limits, which have been sorely tested over the past decade courtesy of the blistering appreciation of megacap growth stocks. Such companies are largely represented by the aptly named Magnificent Seven, which includes Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla Inc. The so-called pain trade of prolonged, Mag-Seven-related underperformance has been pervasive across investment styles, countries and active management in general.\n\nValue managers have been caught in the wrong place (or style) at the wrong time, to say the least. As the accompanying table shows, growth stocks have left their value counterparts in the dust over the decade ending in 2023.\n\nThis incredible dispersion has caused investment styles to dominate investment acumen to the point where even some of the best value managers have underperformed some of the worst growth managers. There has been little, if anything, that a value-based investor could have done to avoid getting outrun by the growth-trade juggernaut that has dominated markets over the past 10 years.\n\nThe tremendous run of Mag-Seven companies has also had a profound effect on the relative performance of different countries and regions. The S&P 500, which has been turbocharged by its heavy exposure to these companies, has left non-U.S. indexes in the dust. If you were underweight U.S. stocks, you were doomed to underperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Mag-Seven juggernaut has also cast a dark shadow over active management. During the decade ending in 2023, 90.2 per cent of U.S. large-cap managers underperformed their benchmarks, according to Morningstar Inc. Most clients’ experiences have been less than inspiring, if not disappointing, when it comes to active equity strategies.\n\nFrom big is bad to big is beautiful\n\nOver the past several decades, underweighting the very largest stocks has been a winning bet. Since 1957, the 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500 have underperformed an equal-weighted portfolio of the other 490 stocks by an average of 2.4 per cent per year.\n\nThe past decade has witnessed a violent reversal of this trend, with the largest 10 stocks outperforming by an impressive average annual rate of 4.9 per cent. This dramatic break from history proves that the Magnificent Seven are truly deserving of their name. Moreover, their jaw-dropping run has been uninterrupted, with 2022 being the only year in which they failed to outperform. This blip was quickly erased in 2023, with the seven companies outperforming the S&P 500 by a whopping 60 per cent.\n\nThe dramatic megacap outperformance of the past decade has proven particularly challenging for active managers, who tend to overwhelmingly underweight the largest stocks. This means they are, by and large, doomed to underperform when such companies outperform their peers.\n\nManagers’ historical bias against megacaps, as well as the latter’s longer-term historical underperformance, is well-justified. The performance of any stock can be attributed to earnings growth and valuation expansion or compression. In general, it is more difficult for megacap companies to achieve above-average earnings growth than their smaller counterparts.\n\nIt becomes difficult for a company that already has a substantial market share to maintain a high rate of growth. As such, the largest stocks achieve their size in large part due to multiple expansion. This has often left them in the precarious position of having to deliver exceptional earnings growth to produce good returns for their investors. This dynamic has historically proven costly, leading to underperformance.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nTo be fair, the Magnificent Seven’s magnificence cannot be solely attributed to the performance of their stock prices. Their underlying fundamentals are impressive, too.\n\nApple’s brand value provides it with a moat that protects it from both existing and potential competitors. The advertising power of Alphabet and Meta is nearly unassailable. Cloud infrastructure has been effectively duopolized by Amazon and Microsoft. Nvidia is the world’s premier GPU manufacturer, which places it in the enviable position of being able to capitalize on the artificial-intelligence-related explosion in demand for its products.\n\nThe bottom line is that these seven companies are well-deserving of premium valuations. But the more relevant question is whether the size of their premiums reflects excessive optimism, and whether they are likely to continue to deliver market-crushing stock performance going forward.\n\nAt the start of the decade, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet had a combined P/E ratio of 15 compared to the market’s P/E of roughly 18.2, which provided them with a healthy base for future outperformance. These companies, alongside their Magnificent Seven peers, also managed to grow their earnings at a ferocious clip, which further contributed to the phenomenal returns of their stocks.\n\nAs things currently are, the Magnificent Seven do not stand to benefit from relatively cheap valuations, with an aggregate P/E of 37 versus 25 for the market. Moreover, some of these seven companies may be exposed to significant regulatory/legal risks.\n\nThe announcement in March by the Department of Justice that it is launching a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly limiting competition and harming consumers may be a harbinger of things to come. These types of headwinds may serve to compound the challenge of maintaining rapid earnings growth from a position of market share dominance.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven also pose problems for passive, index investors from a diversification perspective. These companies currently have a combined weight in the S&P 500 of roughly 28 per cent compared to 13 per cent a decade ago. If you don’t have a strong view that these companies will continue to trounce the other 493 companies in the index, then indexing involves taking more risk (through a lack of diversification) without any commensurate upside.\n\nWhen low interest rates cause people to do dumb things Ways for investors to not be fooled by knowledge Take Buffett's investing advice seriously, not literally\n\nNobody knows whether megacap stocks will continue their record-beating run. But the past several years notwithstanding, the historical track record of megacaps that are trading at a substantial premium to the market is far from pretty. Should megacaps underperform, which seems like a reasonable longer-term bet, skilled active managers, and those with a value bias in particular, stand to outperform by a significant margin.\n\nNoah Solomon is chief investment officer at Outcome Metric Asset Management LP.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nIf you like this story, sign up for the FP Investor Newsletter.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the business news you need to know — add financialpost.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An Apple Inc. retail store in the upscale town of Short Hills, New Jersey, has petitioned to unionize, marking the first such effort after a yearlong lull.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Sees Imminent Missile Strike on Israel by Iran, Proxies US Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets US Inflation Refuses to Bend, Fanning Fears It Will Stick Chinese Cement Maker Halted After 99% Crash in 15 Minutes S&P 500 Hit by Fed-Pivot Rethink and War Jitters: Markets Wrap\n\nThe store, located within a mall, has 104 employees that would be part of the union if the effort moves forward. The staff, represented by Communications Workers of America, filed its petition with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday.\n\nThis marks the fifth US Apple store where workers have petitioned to unionize, joining locations in Oklahoma City, the Maryland town of Towson, Atlanta and St. Louis. So far, only the Towson and Oklahoma City sites have successfully unionized.\n\n“We strongly believe forming a union is the best way to ensure all Apple workers receive the respect, pay, benefits and working conditions we deserve,” John Nagy, a member of the organizing committee for the New Jersey, said in a statement provided by the CWA. “While Apple has responded to organizing by violating workers’ rights at stores across the country, we hope Apple’s executives will recognize their opportunity to stay on the cutting edge by taking a different approach.”\n\nHe added that the group asked Apple “not to interfere in our ongoing organizing efforts and, instead, allow workers to freely determine for themselves whether to form a union.”\n\nIn a statement, Apple said that it was “dedicated to providing an excellent experience for our customers and teams.”\n\n“We have always paid our retail teams in the top tier of the market,” the Cupertino, California-based company said. “And we provide exceptional and comprehensive benefits for all full- and part-time employees as a part of the overall support we provide to our valued team members.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Apple Continues Efforts to Keep Retail Stores From Unionizing\n\nIn June 2022, the Towson store became Apple’s first US location to successfully unionize, helping set off other efforts. In response, Apple held a number of meetings with retail workers that year and in 2023 to address concerns. The company said that the gatherings were informational sessions, but some workers described them as a ploy to prevent further unions.\n\nFor the last year or so, the Apple unionization efforts appeared to lose momentum. The New Jersey store workers could help rekindle the effort.\n\n“By forming a union, we are expressing our dedication to our work and our customers and our desire to have an independent voice to advocate for more fairness and opportunity for all Apple retail workers,” according to the statement.\n\nThe store has to undergo a process before workers can join the union. If the NLRB holds an election and a majority of voters support the union, then Apple would be required to recognize and negotiate with the group over working conditions and policies.\n\nThe Towson and Oklahoma City workers have so far been unable to reach a collective bargaining agreement with Apple.\n\nLast year, an NLRB judge ruled that Apple illegally “coercively interrogated” employees about their pro-union sympathies at a World Trade Center store in New York City, and a regional director of the agency issued a complaint accusing the company of violating labor law by denying the unionized Towson store the improved benefits it was rolling out elsewhere. Apple has denied wrongdoing.\n\n(Updates with more on Apple’s NLRB history in final paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of Aging Toyota Aims to Beat Hyundai and Ford With Its All-New 4Runner Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "Gold prices are hovering over record high levels. (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGold is shining bright among investors even as faith that central banks will make hefty cuts to interest rates this year dims.\n\nThe spot price of gold (GC=F) has risen to $2,366.30 per ounce, hovering record highs, meaning gold has now risen over 14% since the start of 2024.\n\n“Strong underlying momentum with the buy-on-dip still the prevailing strategy among traders,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\n“Geopolitical risks related to Russia/Ukraine and the Middle East are still playing a supporting role, and the focus is changing from the negative impact of lower rate cut expectations towards higher and sticky inflation,” he added.\n\nWhy are gold prices going up?\n\nGold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven in difficult times, and as a hedge against inflation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe precious metal has had a record-breaking run since mid-February, boosted by expectations for US rate cuts, geopolitical tensions and China’s economic woes.\n\nFutures traders have reduced bets on how much the US Federal Reserve will cut rates this year to the lowest level since October.\n\nTraders now expect fewer than three quarter-point cuts to US interest rates this year, down from up to six cuts expected in January.\n\nHigh interest rates usually constrain the appeal of holding non-yielding gold, but the precious metal has been ignoring these factors so far. The market is waiting for the US Federal Reserve’s policy meeting minutes and US inflation data due on Wednesday for fresh signals on future US rate path.\n\nRead more: UK interest rate cut more likely as pay growth slows\n\nSome central banks have also been adding to their gold reserves, with China’s central bank purchasing gold for its reserves for a 17th straight month in March.\n\nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco said that concerns around the US debt could be pushing some towards the precious metal.\n\n“Then there is the concern about US debt and the long-term unsustainability of the US’ fiscal situation. That seems to have caused some central banks to increase holdings at the expense of US Treasuries,” she said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said in a note that gold could rally to $3,000 per ounce by 2025.\n\nIf I had invested £100 in gold, how much would I have now?\n\nMarkets are volatile and therefore so are investments but given the safe-haven status of gold, the precious metal would have been a safe bet to park your money.\n\nIf you have put £100 in gold in 2023 you would now have £121. However, despite the precious metal rally, had you put those same £100 in bitcoin (BTC-USD), you would today have £396.\n\nSurprisingly, this one commodity performed also as good as the cryptocurrency. Cocoa (CC=F) is up by around 270%, which would have secured you £373.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) shares, two of the Magnificent Seven, would have also outperformed gold. However, their track record shows far more volatility that most investors might be comfortable with, as is the case with Bitcoin.\n\nHow do I invest in gold?\n\nGold falls under the category of alternative investments, named like that as they are usually defined as alternatives to traditional investment assets, such as bonds and equities. They can be anything from art to property, hedge fund investments, gold and gold funds, and digital assets.\n\nFor those wanting to protect their investment portfolio from market uncertainty, it is worth considering gold.\n\nAnyone can invest in physical gold in the form of bars and gold coins. The Royal Mint has recorded a 7% increase in investors purchasing gold bullion last year.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks push higher ahead of key US inflation report\n\nHowever, it might be easier and cheaper to invest in gold through Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or Exchange-traded commodity (ETC) products.\n\nAnother way to go about it is to invest in shares of gold mining companies, which should get you dividends as you are investing in a business and not purely on the precious metal.\n\nLet's take a look at these three ways to invest in gold.\n\nShould you buy gold coins or bullions? A Gold Britannia 2023 coin is shown. (dpa, dpa picture alliance)\n\nIt is probably the first image on our mind when we thing about the precious metal: a gold bar or coins. If you go down this route you are investing in the physical metal.\n\nGold coins are a popular choice but mostly for collectors as you will pay a premium for the design that you might not get back. However, some coins become more desirable for collectors over time so the gambit could pay off.\n\nIf you're not bothered by the aesthetic value of gold, the straight way to go about it is to get a cast bar. A 500g will set you back £30,565 if you purchase it from the Royal Mint.\n\nRead more: King Charles gold bullion coin unveiled by Royal Mint\n\nHowever, you can start smaller, with a 2.5g bar coming in at around £170. Regardless of what you get, make you the purity is above 99.9% for coins and 99.95% for bars, so that it is VAT free.\n\nGold and other precious metals are often weighed in troy ounces. At 31.1034768 grams, one troy ounce is about 10% heavier than a regular ounce.\n\nHow to invest in gold via ETFs or ETCs The world's largest gold bullion coin is displayed to mark the official launch of the Perth Mint Physical Gold Exchange Traded Fund, outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIf you look at gold purely as an investment and do not want to handle things like storage or purity levels you can pick to invest in an ETF or ETC.\n\nThese investment products are funds that consist of only one asset: gold. They trade just like a normal stock but gets its value from holding 'underlying assets' that are centred on the precious metal, like the physical metal, gold futures or exposure to companies that mine the metal.\n\nThe main costs of investing in gold ETFs will be the ongoing charge and any platform fees. You should also pay attention to where the product trades.\n\nMost physical gold is priced in US dollars, so if an ETF or ETC operates in sterling then the USD/GBP (GBP=X)rate will likely play a role a significant role in its performance.\n\nLooking at gold ETFs traded in the USA, the DB Gold Double Long Exchange Traded Notes (DGP) has returned 26% so far this year.\n\nRead more: How to supercharge your pension this year\n\nProShares Ultra (UGL) has delivered 24.99% and Invesco DB Precious Metals Fund (DBP) has recorded a 14.09% gain since January, according to data from VettaFi.\n\nIf you want to keep things in pounds, you some top gold ETFs in the UK include the Invesco Physical Gold ETC (SGLPL.XC), that comes with a 0.12% fee, and aims to replicate the spot price movement of gold bullion as closely as possible.\n\nThere is also the iShares Physical Gold ETC (SGLNL.XC), for the same fee. This product has the particularly of only accepting gold bullion that meets the Good Delivery standards set by the London Bullion Market Association. All assets are classified as responsibly sourced, only allocating gold that was mined after 2022.\n\nBest gold stocks and how to invest in mining companies A worker prepares molten gold before it is poured into bars. (LILLIAN SUWANRUMPHA via Getty Images)\n\nGold-oriented stocks and shares provide exposure to the commodity without the cost of buying and storing it.\n\nYou are investing in a company, just like you would do with any other listed business, but in this case you secure the exposure to gold but could potentially attain higher returns as gold companies can expand production and reduce costs, which can drive profits. As you own shares in the company, you could also be in line for dividends.\n\nIn the US, Galiano Gold (GAU) would have been your best bet. Shares in the company have gained 188%, considerably more than our number two.\n\nSecond place goes to Equinox Gold (EQX), with shares almost doubling. ElDorado Gold (EGO)shares come in at number three, with an 85% increase, according to data from investment platform AJ Bell.\n\nAgain, if you prefer to keep your investments UK-bound, investing in Empire Metals (EEE.L) would have secured you a 397% return in you invested at the start of last year. That means that £100 of shares are now worth close to £400. It is the best performing US-listed gold mining share since January 2023.\n\nSerabi Gold(SRB.L) has climbed over 100%, meaning you would've doubled your investment, same with Resolute Mining (RSG.L).\n\nAs always, past performance is no guarantee of future results and gold should be part of a diversified portfolio.\n\nWatch: Why are gold prices suddenly hitting record highs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android",

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 0.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +6.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $385.52 billion and $404.96 billion estimates indicate +0.6% and +5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "This story was first published on the Benzinga India portal.\n\nIn response to mounting geopolitical tensions, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has boosted its iPhone production in India, reaching an impressive $14 billion in the last fiscal year. This surge signifies a doubling of the tech giant's output, underscoring a strategic move to lessen its reliance on China.\n\nApple's production escalation implies that now, nearly 14% of the company's flagship phones, or approximately one in seven, originate from India. This information is according to undisclosed sources close to the situation as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nSee Also: Why Elon Musk Might Need Mukesh Ambani To Finally Bring Tesla To India\n\nWhile China continues to be a vital player as Apple's foremost production site and largest international market, there are increasing challenges. These include stiff competition from Huawei and constraints on foreign technology, both of which have impacted Apple's revenue within China.\n\nThis boost in Indian manufacturing represents a significant victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration. The government has been actively courting international companies like Apple, offering financial incentives to lure high-end manufacturing to India. As a result, an estimated 150,000 direct jobs have been created at Apple's supplier facilities.\n\nLeading the pack in India are Foxconn and Pegatron, responsible for assembling approximately 67% and 17% of India-produced iPhones, respectively, for the fiscal year ending March 2024.\n\nThe remainder of the production is managed by Wistron’s facility in Karnataka, now under the supervision of Tata Group. This facility is on course to establish one of India’s largest iPhone assembly operations. It's crucial to note that the $14 billion figure represents the factory value of these iPhones and not their retail prices.\n\nRead Next: SpaceX Successfully Deploys Tata-Made TSAT-1A Satellite Into Low-Earth Orbit\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Apple's Pivot-From-China Gamble Pays Off: 1 In 7 iPhones Now Made In India originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Meet the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Billionaire Investors Are Absolutely Piling Into",
        "content": "Although Wall Street offers few guarantees, short-term volatility is one of them. Since the curtain opened on 2020, Wall Street's three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years (through 2023).\n\nWhen equities are getting whipsawed by uncertainty, it's not uncommon for professional and retail investors to seek the safety of industry-leading stocks, such as the companies that make up the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPatient investors have gravitated to the \"Magnificent Seven\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are seven of the largest and most influential publicly traded companies. Listed in descending order of current market cap (as of April 5, 2024), these seven titans are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two defining traits that have made the Magnificent Seven such popular holdings for investors. To start with, they're undeniable outperformers. Over the trailing decade, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained a rock-solid 182%. Comparatively, Nvidia's stock has zoomed higher by approximately 19,230%, the shares of Amazon and Tesla have gained more than 1,000%, and Alphabet is bringing up the caboose with a gain of \"only\" 464% from its Class A shares (GOOGL). MSFT Chart\n\nThe other reason investors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven is because they all offer clearly defined competitive advantages or seemingly impenetrable moats.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure service platform Azure ranks second in global market share. Meanwhile, Windows remains the clear leader in desktop operating systems. Apple's iPhone has accounted for a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market since introducing 5G-capable versions in 2020. Apple also has the largest share repurchase program on Wall Street. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are powering the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs are expected to account for a 90% share of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon sits at the top of the pack in e-commerce and among cloud infrastructure service platforms. Its e-commerce marketplace oversaw nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) gobbled up a 31% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending in the September-ended quarter. Alphabet's Google has a virtual monopoly in global internet search, with a 91% share in March 2024. Alphabet is also the parent of the second-most-visited social network (YouTube) and the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Meta Platforms' social media networks attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users (MAUs) during the December-ended quarter. This includes Facebook, which alone lured in 3.07 billion MAUs. Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's been generating a recurring profit. Last year, Tesla produced almost 1.85 million EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors have been selling all but one of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nBut in spite of the overwhelming success of the Magnificent Seven, many of Wall Street's most prominent billionaire investors began kicking these outperformers to the curb during the December-ended quarter.\n\nAll told, six of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks were either jettisoned from billionaires' portfolios or meaningfully pared down, including:\n\nNvidia: Eight highly successful billionaire money managers reduced their positions in this AI titan, with Israel Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares sold), Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares sold), and Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares sold) leading the way. Microsoft: Seven accomplished billionaires were sellers of Microsoft stock in the December-ended quarter, including Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (3,024,399 shares sold) and Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (1,155,782 shares sold), who both closed out their respective funds' positions. Alphabet: Seven top-tier billionaire asset managers dumped shares of Alphabet during the fourth quarter. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont (3,302,342 shares sold), Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel (3,113,001 shares sold), and Tiger Global Management's Chase Coleman (1,278,300 shares sold) were the respective top sellers. Meta Platforms: Six tenured billionaires gave shares of Meta the boot in the quarter ended in December. The top sellers included Jeff Yass of Susquehanna (3,037,082 shares sold) and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global (1,430,767 shares sold). Apple: Four respected billionaire money managers reduced their stakes in Apple during the fourth quarter. This included Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who oversaw the sale of a little over 10 million shares of Apple. Tesla: A total of three well-known billionaire investors sold shares of EV maker Tesla in the final quarter of 2023. Billionaires John Overdeck and David Siegel, who co-founded Two Sigma Investments, saw their funds sell all 1,015,385 shares of Tesla they'd owned as of the previous quarter.\n\nThe one name missing from this list, and the only Magnificent Seven stock that billionaires are absolutely piling into, is e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the fourth quarter, eight billionaires added shares of Amazon to their respective funds, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares) Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHere's why billionaire investors can't stop buying Amazon stock\n\nIf you're wondering why billionaires are buying shares of Amazon stock while paring down or exiting their stakes in the other Magnificent Seven stocks, look no further than Amazon's trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments: AWS, advertising services, and subscription services.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its leading online marketplace, e-commerce generates very low margins. The bulk of the cash flow and operating income Amazon produces come from its trio of ancillary segments.\n\nNone of these segments is more important than AWS. Enterprise cloud spending is still relatively early in its ramp, which suggests sustained double-digit sales growth should be the expectation for AWS. Even though this segment only accounted for a sixth of Amazon's net sales last year, it provided about two-thirds of its operating income.\n\nAmazon's advertising operations are another source of sustained growth. In a typical month, Amazon's website is the destination for well over 2 billion visitors, many of whom are motivated shoppers. This makes Amazon one of the primary platforms that merchants want to target when getting their message(s) in front of consumers.\n\nThe third key operating division is subscription services. The last time Amazon updated its global Prime subscription count was April 2021, when then-CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company had surpassed 200 million. With Amazon gaining the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, there's a high likelihood this subscription total has jumped further.\n\nCollectively, the lure of these higher-growth segments is their cash flow generation. Throughout the 2010s, investors comfortably paid a multiple of 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon stock. Patient investors can purchase shares of Amazon right now for just 13 times consensus cash flow in 2025. Even approaching its previous all-time high, Amazon stock is historically inexpensive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget the \"Magnificent Seven,\" All Eyes Should Be on the \"Fab Four\"",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks led the broader market last year. This group of the world's largest technology companies impressed with 2023 returns ranging between 48% and 238%. That's impressive for companies already worth trillions of dollars in some cases!\n\nBut 2024 has represented a changing of the guard of sorts. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) have hit some headwinds. The remaining group of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) continue to rally, resembling a new group, a \"Fab Four\" that continues to carry the market to all-time highs.\n\nCan they continue to separate themselves from the pack?\n\nForget the Magnificent Seven and embrace the Fab Four. Here is what you need to know.\n\nA changing of the guard in 2024\n\nApple, Tesla, and Alphabet haven't kept up the pace since 2024 began. Alphabet's year-to-date gains have \"only\" tracked the S&P 500, while Apple and Tesla have started to slide. Apple and Tesla are reporting hiccups in their growth efforts. Tesla's deliveries began 2024 with a thud, while Apple is dealing with weakness in China, a vital market for the iPhone maker. Meanwhile, Alphabet is experiencing its first threat to its monopoly on search engine traffic from generative artificial intelligence (AI). AAPL Chart\n\nThese massive companies can't maintain these tremendous investment returns if they don't deliver the performance to back up those high expectations. Analysts have dramatically soured on Tesla's near-term growth outlook, and Apple's valuation got too hot for the growth it was putting on the table.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" enjoy growth tailwinds\n\nThe remainder of the Magnificent Seven form the Fab Four, thanks primarily to expected tailwinds from artificial intelligence over the coming years. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, which are needed to power the massive computer systems that run AI. Amazon and Microsoft operate the world's two largest cloud platforms, the underpinnings of the internet, and what will be various AI applications. Lastly, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI for digital advertising while investing heavily in augmented reality.\n\nStory continues NVDA EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nAnalysts are optimistic about the growth these opportunities will create, calling for annualized long-term earnings growth ranging from 15% to 35% over the next three to five years.\n\nValuations say the momentum can continue\n\nHow much you pay for a stock always matters. It's not that Tesla, Alphabet, and Apple can't succeed in the future, but their valuations have become too disconnected from what the market expects growth to look like.\n\nInvestors can use the PEG ratio to compare a stock's valuation to the company's expected earnings growth to determine whether shares are still a good value. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf you use the data from the above charts, the Fab Four have the following PEG ratios:\n\nNvidia: 1 Amazon: 1.9 Microsoft: 2.4 Meta: 1.3\n\nThe lower the PEG ratio is, the better the value. I generally look to buy when PEG ratios are under 1.5, so Nvidia and Meta remain excellent deals if they can deliver the growth analysts expect from them. Amazon is a bit more expensive but is a more capital-intensive company. If you price the stock to its operating cash flow, its valuation is still below its decade average. Admittedly, Microsoft is beginning to look expensive, so investors may want to think twice before buying shares.\n\nAll the companies in the Magnificent Seven are among the best in their respective industries and could easily be long-term winners. But the cream eventually rises to the top, which could be Nvidia and Meta Platforms based on the numbers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s quarterly revenue grew at its fastest pace in more than a year, shoring up expectations that a global boom in AI development is fueling demand for high-end chips and servers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Slams Strikes on Russia Oil Refineries as Risk to Oil Markets Bond Trader Places Record Futures Bet on Eve of Inflation Data Iran’s Better, Stealthier Drones Are Remaking Global Warfare Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Ukraine Says It’s Behind Blaze on Russian Warship in Baltic Sea\n\nThe main chipmaker to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. reported a better-than-expected 16% rise in March-quarter sales to about NT$592.6 billion ($18.5 billion), versus the NT$579.5 billion average projection.\n\nThat outperformance lends weight to expectations that the world’s most valuable chipmaker will return to solid growth this year after weathering a post-Covid cratering of smartphone and computer sales. TSMC is budgeting capital expenditure of $28 billion to $32 billion and expects revenue to grow at least 20% this year, reversing 2023’s slight decline.\n\nAsia’s largest company has more than doubled in value since an October 2022 trough, as investors bet on sustained demand for the advanced AI chips it makes for the likes of Nvidia. That’s offset lingering concerns about whether the global smartphone slump has run its course. The company is slated to report full earnings April 18.\n\nTSMC in January said its AI revenue is growing at 50% annually. The company is building plants in the US, Japan and Germany as it races to fabricate the AI chips used in data centers operated by internet powerhouses including Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\nSigns are growing also of a broader market recovery. Asian rival Samsung Electronics Co.’s profit rebounded sharply in the first quarter, reflecting in part a turnaround in the company’s pivotal semiconductor division.\n\nStill, some investors have warned that the current level of AI chip demand is unsustainable over the long run. Others remain wary given the uncertainty hanging over the Taiwan Strait, the narrow body of water between mainland China and an island it views as a breakaway province.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd Apple — TSMC’s most important customer — is struggling to grow sales of the iPhone particularly in China, where Huawei Technologies Co. is eroding its dominance of the high-end market.\n\n—With assistance from Cindy Wang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Everyone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee\n\nSTOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies.\n\nThe early results come after the EU's sweeping Digital Markets Act, which aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers from a \"choice screen.\"\n\nBrowsers are software that help users connect to the internet and are traditionally offered by big technology companies like Apple and Google for free in exchange for tracking which websites consumers visit and selling advertisement to them.\n\nIn mobile devices that run Android, Chrome browser comes as default and iPhones with Safari, making them the dominant browsers in the market.\n\nCyprus-based Aloha Browser said users in the EU jumped 250% in March - one of the first companies to give monthly growth numbers since the new regulations came in.\n\nFounded in 2016, Aloha, which markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers owned by big tech, has 10 million monthly average users and earns money through paid subscriptions, rather than selling ads by tracking users.\n\n\"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two,\" Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview.\n\nNorway's Vivaldi, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have also seen user numbers rise following the new regulation.\n\nU.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its bigger rival, Norway-based Opera are also seeing growth in users, but said the choice screen rollout is still not complete.\n\n\"We are experiencing record user numbers in the EU right now,\" said Jan Standal, vice president at Opera, which counts over 324 million global users.\n\nStory continues\n\nCHOSEN ONES\n\nUnder the new EU rules, mobile software makers are required to show a choice screen where users can select a browser, search engine and virtual assistant as they set up their phones.\n\nPreviously, tech companies such as Apple and Google loaded phones with default settings that included their preferred services, such as the voice assistant Siri for iPhones. Changing these settings required a more complicated process.\n\nApple is now showing up to 11 browsers in addition to Safari in the choice screens curated for each of the 27 countries in the EU, and will update those screens once every year for each country.\n\nWhile DuckDuckGo and Opera are offered in Apple's list in all 27 countries, Aloha is in 26 countries, Ecosia is in 13 and Vivaldi in 8.\n\nGoogle is currently showing browser choices on devices made by the company and said new devices made by other companies running Android operating system will also display choice screen in the coming months.\n\nA Google spokesperson said they do not have data on choice screens to share yet.\n\nAs iPhones have a bigger market share than Google-branded phones, the growth for smaller browsers is currently coming at the cost of Safari.\n\nOpera said most of the positive trends are from people making Opera the default browser on their iPhones.\n\nBut browser companies criticized how Apple and Google rolled out the new features which they described as slow and clunky, and they believe are slowing the migration of mobile users to new browser choices.\n\nMozilla, which owns Firefox browser, estimates that only 19% of iPhone users in the region received an update in a roll-out that appeared much slower than previous software updates, the company said.\n\nIn iPhones, users can see the choice screen only when they click Safari, and then users are shown a list of browsers with no additional information, said Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, CEO of Norway's Vivaldi.\n\n\"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name,\" he said.\n\nThe complicated design has led European Commission to start a non-compliance investigation into whether Apple may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services.\n\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm and Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by Kenneth Li and Daniel Wallis)",

        "content": "It’s no secret that tech stocks are on fire. The major American stock indexes have reached new highs in 2024, with growth and technology companies leading the way. There are good reasons for much of these gains, such as the booms that we’re seeing in artificial intelligence and semiconductors right now.\n\nHowever, not all tech stocks are created equal, and several are being overvalued. Many firms that are rallying today simply do not have the sort of fundamentals to back up these powerful moves that we’ve seen over the past 12 months.\n\nIt’s now time to be taking profits on these overvalued tech stocks. These three in particular look vulnerable to serious drawdowns in the months to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an Indian online travel agency. Investors have long viewed it as something akin to the Expedia of the Indian market.\n\nShares have been publicly traded for more than a decade. Traditionally, they’ve had a rocky go of it with the stock essentially trading flat between 2012 and 2022. However, as the travel reopening theme took off, MMYT stock has surged over the past year.\n\nShares have skyrocketed from a low of $25 last year to more than $75 per share today. All told, the stock is up 217% over the past 12 months and, incredibly enough, is already up 62% year-to-date.\n\nThere’s a real story to the underlying company. MakeMyTrip is growing its earnings quickly thanks to the strong global economy and heightened travel spending. However, the travel boom is unlikely to persist forever.\n\nMeanwhile, MMYT stock is going for more than 100 times trailing earnings and 11 times price-to-sales. The valuation looks exceedingly expensive for an online travel agency.\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company which develops and operates a mobile marketing platform and ecosystem. It offers products such as AppDiscovery, MAX, and SparkLabs.\n\nAppLovin, as the name might suggest, primarily helps mobile application developers to monetize their programs, and further boost their marketing and consumer engagement efforts.\n\nAPP stock has gone on an absolute tear over the past year with the shares rising more than 350%. This seems completely unjustified. The company grew revenues just 17% over the past year, which is certainly a respectable rate but not typically associated with such a dramatic stock price increase.\n\nInvestors are pleased that AppLovin has been able to work around some of the privacy restrictions that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other operators have put in their ecosystems. AppLovin is certainly making progress as a business and its AI ad system is also sparking investor enthusiasm. But at 75 times trailing earnings, this seems grossly overvalued for a company with a fairly pedestrian revenue growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\n25 years ago, Dell (NYSE:DELL) was a popular investment as it was at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware.\n\nBut times change. The Dell of today has become a somewhat stodgy IT vendor that has traditionally earned a low valuation from Wall Street. The company has barely grown top-line revenues in recent years, making it a cash cow but one with seemingly limited upside.\n\nIn today’s market, a dash of artificial intelligence will cause a stock to skyrocket. DELL stock is now up 225% over the past 12 months pushing the normally staid hardware company up to a surprising 30 times P/E multiple.\n\nMake no mistake, Dell is selling some AI enabled servers and hardware. To some extent, Dell will benefit from current trends. However, the move seems grossly overdone. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin sees more than 50% downside for DELL stock from current levels as the hype wears off.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple is aiming the Vision Pro at enterprises",
        "content": "It’s been just over two months since Apple (APPL) launched its Vision Pro AR/VR headset. At $3,500, the device, which Apple calls a spatial computer, is a pricey proposition for many consumers. But the enterprise market is another beast altogether, which is why the company is keen on showing off the Vision Pro’s business bona fides. After all, if Apple can entice large businesses to purchase Vision Pros in bulk, it would provide a solid boost to overall sales numbers.\n\nApple has a history of pushing what might seem to be consumer products into businesses. The iPhone is a mainstay of offices around the world, as are its MacBook and Mac lines of laptops and desktops. And while Apple doesn't release numbers for how many of its product sales go toward consumers and how many go toward businesses, having those enterprise clients all but guarantees a continuous stream of upgrades as older devices reach the end of their lifecycles and newer, more powerful ones come to market.\n\nTo that end, I sat down for a demo of some of the enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro and came away impressed by what the headset has to offer. Much of what the company offers seemed to provide genuinely worthwhile use cases for workers, though, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, so I can't say for sure.\n\nAnd while these were enterprise apps, they still managed to feel as immersive as their consumer-based counterparts. Though, I don't expect anyone to start downloading them from the App Store for fun.\n\nApple isn’t alone in the AR/VR enterprise space. Rival Meta (META) also offers its Meta Quest line of headsets as a business product complete with enterprise-focused administrative software and controls.\n\nStill, demonstrating the Vision Pro's enterprise chops could prove to be a lucrative move for Apple as it ramps up headset sales in hopes of turning the device into a major moneymaker.\n\nBusiness uses for an expensive headset\n\nDuring my brief 30-minute demo with Apple, I tried four different apps: SAP Analytics Cloud, Complete HeartX, Resolve, and JigSpace. Each of the apps featured interactive augmented reality functionality designed to help workers do everything from training for specific tasks and studying pieces of equipment they may have to service in the future to getting a better understanding of their business’s overall performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most impressive demo of the bunch was Complete HeartX. The app, developed by Elsevier, is designed to help healthcare workers, such as nursing students, get a better sense of how the heart functions in a living person and how to draw blood.\n\nUsers see a fully 3D model of a person and use their hands to pinpoint a spot of the model’s body to reveal the location of blood vessels, veins, and the heart. The app also offers a 3D model of a beating heart that helps users better understand how blood flows throughout the body. An Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset is seen at Apple store in New York, United States on Feb. 3, 2024. (Fatih Aktas/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud, meanwhile, allows users to view datasets in a 3D environment, making them easier to digest than simply reading them on a spreadsheet. The demo I saw involved viewing a corporate headquarters with small pegs floating above each building.\n\nLooking at a building and tapping my fingers together pulled up the number of employees that worked in each building on specific days. It also provided a breakdown of how many people parked at the complex’s parking garages and whether they drove EVs or traditional gas-powered cars.\n\nThe Resolve app allowed me to view a schematic of an HVAC system and then see a digital version of it at scale above me. The idea is to give HVAC workers a sense of where things like air ducts and sprinkler heads are located before going to a job site, so they don't have to waste time searching while on the job.\n\nThen there was my demo of JigSpace, which entailed placing a massive jet engine in a room and pulling it apart by staring at individual pieces to select them and tapping my fingers together to tear them out. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEach of the demos offered excellent visuals and interactivity, but I didn’t see anything that other headsets don't offer. I’ve used AR/VR devices in the past to perform faux surgery on 3D models of people, look at accurate representations of things like cars and planes, and more.\n\nThe Vision Pro does, however, bring along an incredibly easy-to-use interface, interoperability with other Apple devices, and an overall cleaner operating system. If Apple can convince a relatively small number of businesses to purchase the Vision Pro, it could give the headset a nice sales boost.\n\nWe’ll likely get some inkling as to overall Vision Pro uptake when Apple announces its second quarter earnings in the coming weeks.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are seven tech companies that have come to be known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nAlthough investors usually target this bunch for their growth potential, some may wonder which Magnificent Seven stock is the least expensive.\n\nBased on a few popular valuation metrics, Apple stands out as the best all-around value of the group. Here's why Apple is inexpensive relative to its top tech peers. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nApple's discounted valuation\n\nFor younger, unprofitable companies, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio can be a good metric for evaluating a stock and its value relative to its revenue. But for more mature, industry-leading companies -- which includes all of the Magnificent Seven -- the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is arguably a better metric.\n\nBut accounting nuances can sometimes inflate or discount a company's earnings. A one-off impairment charge or gain from the sale of assets don't reflect core operations. With that in mind, looking at the P/E ratio in tandem with price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) can give investors a more accurate representation of a company's valuation.\n\nNot long ago, Alphabet was the least expensive Magnificent Seven stock. But a 15% rally for the stock in the past month has pushed its valuation higher. Meanwhile, Apple is down 3% over the same period.\n\nAs a result, Apple now has the lowest P/E ratio of the Magnificent Seven stocks. AAPL PE Ratio Chart\n\nAnd it also has the lowest P/FCF multiple at 25. Data by YCharts.\n\nSince Dec. 2023, Apple's P/E valuation has fallen enough that it now trades at a discount to the S&P 500. But there are some good reasons for this.\n\nApple's issues in a nutshell\n\nThe abridged version of Apple's woes: Its growth has ground to a halt. The company is facing negative sales growth in China, and it hasn't monetized artificial intelligence (AI) in a meaningful way, while the majority of the Magnificent Seven have. A core reason Microsoft overtook Apple to become the most valuable company in the world is its short- and long-term runway for leveraging AI across its business segments.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's lack of iPhone innovation has been a concern for years. But maybe more alarming is the dry spell in its new product development pipeline. The Apple Vision Pro is the latest product, but it remains to be seen if that will pay off in the same way as past products like the iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and others. Besides the Vision Pro, Apple hasn't released a showstopper product since the AirPods in Sept. 2016.\n\nThis is still a massively profitable company that can buy back a boatload of its own stock while raising its dividend, which can help make the valuation more attractive even when growth is slow. But what Apple really needs is innovation.\n\nRestoring investor confidence\n\nOn Mar. 26, Apple announced its annual Worldwide Developers Conference will take place at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, from June 10 to June 14. To quote the announcement:\n\nFree for all developers, WWDC24 will spotlight the latest iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS advancements. As part of Apple's ongoing commitment to helping developers elevate their apps and games, the event will also provide them with unique access to Apple experts, as well as insight into new tools, frameworks, and features.\n\nThe stakes are high for two reasons. The first is that this is an opportunity for Apple to flex its technological advancements with product announcements likely to come during its annual September unveiling event. The second is the company's relationship with developers is the spotlight of the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple.\n\nApple is in a unique position because it needs to show progress while also conveying that it's treating developers fairly.\n\nBuying Apple for the right reasons\n\nNegative sentiment has mounted against Apple, in contrast to the many tech giants now enjoying AI-fueled valuation expansions.\n\nDespite this near-term pressure, Apple's core investment thesis hasn't really changed. It's still an industry-leading company with arguably the most impressive vertical integration on the planet. An investment in Apple is about its multi-decade runway in consumer electronics, the integration and value add of services like Apple TV and Apple Music, and new product developments.\n\nThe company may face some near-term challenges, but its stock shouldn't trade at a discount to the broad market. Investors who have been watching Apple are now getting an opportunity to buy its stock at a good value. However, they'll need to be patient as it could take a while for Apple to regain favor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best penny stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Griffin. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin.\n\nThe markets were off to an impressive start in 2024, driven by expectations that the US Federal Reserve will embark on interest rate cuts. However, data is now showing that inflation remains sticky and the labor market tight, causing new concerns regarding the Fed's possible path towards rate cuts. In this environment it makes sense to look towards masters of the money game.\n\nKen Griffin is one of the hedge fund managers well-positioned to benefit from the ever-evolving financial landscape. The mastermind behind Citadel Investment Group, which he founded in 1990 with $4.2 million, continues to experience a surge in success. The legendary investor set a record with a remarkable return of 153% in 2022 as he got everything right with his strategic bets on inflation and interest rates.\n\nWith a portfolio value of over $460 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street's most tracked hedge funds, consistently surpassing 25% annual returns since 2016. While the hedge fund operates several portfolio funds, its lead fund is Wellington, which invests in various asset classes and sectors as part of its diversification strategy.\n\nIn 2022, Griffin’s flagship Wellington fund delivered 38% returns above the 26% returns that it delivered in 2021, upon topping the 24% gain in 2020. The fund was also up 19.4% in 2019, more than double the 9.1% gain in 2018.\n\nGriffin's hedge fund deploys a multi-strategy investing method that allows it to take advantage of long and short-term investment opportunities. In 2023, when the hedge fund industry came under immense pressure and ended up averaging a 4.4% gain, Citadel outperformed the entire industry, delivering solid returns of 15.3%.\n\nThe flagship fund had an excellent start to 2024, achieving a 1.9% increase in the first month as all employed strategies across commodities, equities, fixed income, credit, and quantitative sectors yielded positive results. Griffin expects the momentum to continue throughout the year as he remains bullish about the US economy amid the expected interest rate cuts.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Federal Reserve can start cutting rates this summer, and we will see unemployment increase slightly. But the overall economy looks pretty damn good right now,” Griffin said at the MFA Network event in Miami. “This is a real change in mindset from where we were September, October last year.”\n\nCitadel Group generated a profit of $7 billion in 2023. Nevertheless, it was an underperformance, considering a 38% profit jump in 2022 to $16 billion. Similarly, Citadel Investment Group has kept its tradition of returning significant value to shareholders. It has returned over $25 billion since 2018.\n\nGriffin's impressive performance in the market has everything to do with his focus on large-cap, high-growth stocks. Citadel Investment Group boasts significant holding in the magnificent 7 stocks led by Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The stocks posted double-digit gains in 2023.\n\nAmid the aggressive investment style focusing on high-growth technology stocks, Griffin is also a value investor who often looks for opportunities in small-cap and penny stocks. With a net worth of $35 billion, the billionaire investor employs 18,000 people to scan the best high-risk reward opportunities. 13 Best Penny Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Griffin\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Investment Group\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned billionaire Griffin's portfolio and picked 13 penny stocks he's holding.

Links which result in digital purchases, however, carry a 27% fee to Apple, including for subsequent auto-renewing subscriptions.\n\n\"We are currently assessing whether Apple has fully complied with the decision,\" a Commission spokesperson said.\n\n\"In general, if the Commission suspects that there is non-compliance with an adopted decision, it will send the undertaking concerned a Statement of Objections,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nApple's plan complies with the Commission decision, an Apple representative said.\n\nSpotify bemoaned the fact that it was still waiting for Apple to comply with the EU order, five weeks on.\n\nSeparately, the Commission is also investigating Apple's rules for its App Store and measures it announced recently to comply with new EU legislation known as the Digital Markets Act on concerns that these and various charges may hinder developers from freely communicating and promoting their offers.\n\n($1 = 0.9234 euros) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee Editing by Kevin Liffey and Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE: SPOT) continues to integrate AI into its music streaming offerings. On Friday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced changes that should benefit Spotify and other streaming apps as it will now inform users of other ways to purchase digital services on its App Store. This change came as result the $1.99 billion fine Apple was charged by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals through its Apple Store restrictions.\n\nApple Has Some Catching Up To Do\n\nPerhaps not the greatest rivalry of all time, but the Apple Music and Spotify rivalry is undoubtedly among the music streaming industry’s greats. Spotify has been around for longer than Apple Music. Yet, Apple made an impressive digital music footprint and used its iPhone power to make things trickier for Spotify. By the looks of it, the EU regulators have put an end to those days. Strangely, Apple has been late in in infusing AI to enhance its offerings. While Apple has been keeping quiet on AI, it did add personalized recommendations last year, back when Spotify expanded its AI DJ. Generative AI has quickly grown to become much more than a simple buzzword, so Apple cannot afford to take a back seat but it’s nature has always been about being secretive- only time will show how it intends to infuse it across its offerings.\n\nMeanwhile, Spotify Continues Its Generative AI Journey\n\nLast February, Spotify launched its AI-powered DJ feature. Six months after the North America and Canada debut, it expanded it to dozens of markets across the globe. An English-speaking personalized radio DJ has been a success. Now, Spotify took the next step by launching personalized AI playlists that one can build using written prompts. Moreover, besides allowing users to specify their musical wishes beyond the genre with prompts referencing a range of things, from moods to movie characters, activities, and so on, AI can be used to further refine the result after the list is generated. At first, the feature will be available to U.K. and Australia.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek has also offered many teasers of ways the music streaming company can exploit AI, such as by summarizing podcasts and creating AI-generated audio ads. With AI-powered capabilities, Spotify can personalize its offerings like never before while also gaining the ability to become more efficient such as by significantly lowering the cost that it takes for advertisers to develop new ad formats. In simple words, the DJ feature was merely the beginning of Spotify’s AI journey.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra\n\nBENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pegatron is in advanced talks to hand over control of its only iPhone manufacturing facility in India to the Tata Group, said two sources with direct knowledge, marking the Taiwanese firm's latest scale back of its Apple partnership.\n\nUnder the deal, which has received the backing of Apple, Tata plans to hold at least a 65% stake in a joint venture that will operate the Pegatron plant near Chennai city in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with the Taiwanese firm providing technical support and holding the rest, one of the sources said.\n\nTata, one the largest conglomerates in India, will operate the joint venture through its Tata Electronics unit, the second source said.\n\nThe Pegatron India factory has around 10,000 employees and makes 5 million iPhones annually. It is the last such facility operated by the firm after it forfeited control of an iPhone plant in China last year to rival Luxshare in a $290 million deal.\n\nTata and Pegatron did not respond to emailed requests for comments. Apple declined to comment. The sources did not share financial details of the ongoing negotiations.\n\nApple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. For India's Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans.\n\nTata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the neighbouring southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year, and is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where Pegatron is likely to emerge as its joint venture partner.\n\nPegatron has for months also been building another iPhone factory at its Chennai campus, and the Tata deal talks include taking over that facility as well, the first source said.\n\nThe talks between Tata and Pegatron for the factory are expected to close in six months and will see all of the Pegatron India employees move to the joint venture entity, the first source added.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's iPhone contract manufacturers in India currently include Tata, Pegatron and Foxconn. Tata is key to Apple's growing ambitions in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14% last year.\n\nThe reasons for Pegatron's gradual withdrawal from its Apple business, including in India, were not known. Last year, Pegatron said the China plant deal was done to raise capital to \"optimise its business\".\n\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard)",

        "content": "The Biden administration said Monday it plans to send up to $6.6 billion in federal grants to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) as the chipmaking giant promises a $25 billion Arizona expansion that will bring a third TSMC fabrication plant to that state.\n\nThe deal, the second major US chipmaking grant announcement of the last three weeks, is part of President Joe Biden's effort to restart advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the US.\n\nIn March Biden said the US would provide up to $8.5 billion in grants in the years ahead to Intel (INTC) to support a range of new projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon.\n\nThe money for both companies is coming from 2022's CHIPs and Science law, a signature accomplishment of Biden's current term.\n\nTSMC will use the grants to fund the continued construction of two manufacturing plants already being built in the Phoenix area. The company also announced Monday it would build a third facility there in the years ahead.\n\nThe goal is for all three plants to be online by the end of the decade and producing TSMC's most advanced chips. Some of the plants even hope to use a forthcoming 2 nanometer fabrication process and make even more advanced chips than are currently available.\n\n\"These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technology that we need to underpin our economy,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters ahead of the announcement. President Joe Biden shakes hands with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Chairman Mark Liu during a tour of the TSMC facility under construction in Phoenix in Dec. 2022. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe $6.6 billion in grants to be doled out in the years ahead include an allotment of $50 million for workforce development as well as additional authorization for up to $5 billion in government loans. That inflow comes in addition to manufacturing tax credits in the 2022 law that could be worth additional billions.\n\nThe government money will pair with TSMC's plans to invest over $65 billion in its Arizona operations. It had previously announced $40 billion and said today it would add an additional $25 billion largely to fund construction of the third fabrication facility.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonday's news underlines the central role that Arizona is playing in the effort to bring back semiconductor manufacturing to the US.\n\nPresident Biden has made multiple semiconductor-themed trips to the state in recent years including a stop last month to announce the grants for Intel, which is also building in the state.\n\n\"It’s an exciting day for Arizona, where we are leading the way in bringing the most advanced microchip manufacturing back to America,\" Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a negotiator of the 2022 law, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nMonday's announcement is the fifth manufacturing award from the law.\n\nIn addition to TSMC and Intel, three smaller manufacturing awards had been previously announced. There was roughly $35 million for BAE Systems (BAESY), $162 million for Microchip Technology, and $1.5 billion for GlobalFoundries (GFS) largely to fund the manufacturing of less advanced but still crucial chips.\n\nThe 20-month-old law allows the White House to spend a total of about $50 billion — $39 billion specifically earmarked for manufacturing — to try and help reignite the sector in the years ahead.\n\nA focus on the labor market\n\nArizona's path to semiconductor centrality began back in May 2020 when TSMC announced new plans for the state.\n\nIt's an effort that has also been marked by struggles to ensure that enough Americans will be trained for the coming positions; TSMC recently announced a delay in their first US plant's full-scale launch from 2024 to 2025 and cited worker shortages as a reason.\n\nThe company is bringing in Taiwanese workers to help keep up.\n\n\"I do expect that immigration and bringing in expertise from Taiwan both on the facilities side and the construction side will continue to be really important,\" says a senior Biden administration official.\n\nBiden officials call TSMC's move the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in US history and is expected to create at least 6,000 direct permanent jobs in addition to 20,000 temporary construction jobs.\n\nThe project is also expected to lead to \"tens of thousands\" of additional jobs as other companies work to supply the new massive facilities.\n\nThe increased investment is due to an ever increasing demand from US companies for chips as well as for chips that are made inside the United States, says Lael Brainard who is the director of Biden's National Economic Council.\n\nShe notes that top officials like Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and NVIDIA (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang attended a 2022 groundbreaking for TSMC's second facility in Arizona. Both Apple and NVIDIA currently rely almost exclusively on chips from the company that are manufactured in Taiwan.\n\nIn a statement, TSMC Chairman Dr. Mark Liu said the government's funding allowed for this increased investment in the US adding \"our U.S. operations allow us to better support our U.S. customers, which include several of the world’s leading technology companies.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook listens as President Joe Biden deliver remarks at a TSMC Semiconductor Manufacturing Facility in Phoenix in December 2022. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nMonday's announcement is part of the Biden administration's ambitious overall goal of having the US produce 20% of the world's most advanced semiconductor chips by the end of the decade.\n\nSecretary Raimondo oversees a team implementing the law and often notes the high challenge ahead with America currently producing 0% of these advanced chips (and only 10% of chips overall).\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Almost Half of Warren Buffett's $369 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "There's no denying Warren Buffett's remarkable track record. As the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has done an amazing job compounding capital at high rates over multiple decades. This is why the average investor closely watches what the Oracle of Omaha owns.\n\nBerkshire's massive $369 billion portfolio has dozens of stocks. But Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which represents 41.4% of the overall portfolio, stands out as the single largest holding. The FAANG stock has soared 542% since the start of 2016 (as of April 2), which is around the time Buffett first started buying the business.\n\nBefore investors contemplate whether it's a good idea to scoop up shares today, it's important to understand the factors that first drew Buffett to Apple.\n\nApple's wonderful qualities\n\nEven in early 2016, Apple had one of the world's strongest brands, boosted by its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products. This gave the company pricing power. Consumers want to continue paying up for new devices.\n\nBuffett appreciates businesses that can consistently ask their customers to pay more without hurting demand. Another top Berkshire holding is Coca-Cola, which certainly fits this category.\n\nApple is a financial powerhouse. In fiscal 2015, the business posted an operating margin of 30%. And it generated $70 billion of free cash flow (FCF) that year.\n\nThis type of profitability continues today. Apple produced $100 billion of FCF in fiscal 2023. Management used this windfall to pay $15 billion in dividends and to repurchase $83 billion worth of outstanding stock.\n\nIn addition to strong financial performance, valuation is another top factor that Buffett looks at. During the first three months of 2016, Apple shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6. Given some of the sky-high valuations in the market today, this was an absolute steal for such a dominant company. Buffett took full advantage of the buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you buy Apple stock right now?\n\nWhile Apple has obviously worked out as a tremendous investment for Berkshire and Buffett, investors shouldn't just automatically buy the stock right now. I think it's best to view the current situation with a fresh perspective.\n\nIf investors can agree on one thing today, it's that Apple is no longer the screaming bargain that it was about eight years ago when Buffett first bought shares. In my opinion, this is an expensive stock right now, which makes sense given its impressive performance over the years.\n\nApple shares trade at a current P/E ratio of 26.3. To be fair, this has come down from the 32.3 it was less than four months ago. But it's still pricey.\n\nThat's because Apple certainly doesn't have the same growth potential that it did several years ago. This is a far more mature enterprise today.\n\nIn fact, the business saw its sales decline slightly in fiscal 2023. And over the next three years, Wall Street analysts expect revenue and earnings per share to rise at annualized clips of 4.4% and 8.3%, respectively. Paying such a high valuation multiple doesn't seem like a smart move considering these weak forecasts.\n\nWe can't read his mind. However, I suspect Buffett still owns the stock because he doesn't want to trigger a taxable event. Or maybe he simply wouldn't know what to do with all the cash, a problem that Berkshire has already been dealing with.\n\nApple has been a huge winner historically. But based on where things stand today, it's best to pass on the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 20 countries with the largest labor force in the world. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go to the 5 Countries with the Largest Labor Force in the World.\n\nA large and skilled labor force is pivotal in driving a country's economy. According to data by the World Bank, the global labor force is 3.62 billion as of 2023, up from 3.55 billion in 2022. The global labor force took a hit because of the COVID-19 pandemic, dropping to 3.43 billion in 2020 from 3.46 billion in 2019. This noticeable fall in global employment recovered within a year, exceeding its pre-pandemic levels in 2021. However, this labor force is unevenly distributed globally, with some countries boasting a larger number of workers than others.\n\nLabor Force in Asia\n\nAccording to data from the World Bank, the total labor force in Asia is in the lead, with 1.27 billion workers in East Asia and the Pacific alone, as of 2023. These numbers are up from 1.26 billion in 2022. According to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), labor force participation in the Asia-Pacific region was 63.2% in 2019. Cambodia, Nepal, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had the region's highest labor force participation rates, going above 80%. On the other hand, Papua New Guinea, India, Samoa, Tonga, and Tajikistan had some of the lowest labor force participation rates in the region, all below 50%.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labour Organization, Asia's labor force represents about 59% of the total global labor force. This number is likely to increase as the population of the Asian continent continues to increase.\n\nLabor Force in the European Union\n\nAccording to data by the World Bank, the European Union has a labor force of 219,901,364 people, as of 2023. Germany, France, and Italy take the lead in this region, with a labor force of around 44 million, 31 million, and 25 million people, respectively. The labor force in the region fell to 215,204,661 people in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the numbers recovered in 2021, increasing to 216,664,379 people. 2022 saw a further increase in the EU's labor force, which increased to 219,322,420 people.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother report by Eurostat revealed that men aged 15-24 had an employment rate of 37.0% in 2022, as compared to a 32.3% employment rate for women. Men between the ages of 25-54 had an employment rate of 87.0% in the same year. On the other hand, women in the same age bracket had an employment rate of 76.5%. The gender employment gap, and thus the difference in the labor force based on gender, increased with age in 2022. It went from a 4.7 point difference for the age group of 15-24 years to a 10.5 point difference for the age group 25-54. However, the employment difference was the highest for the age group 55-64 years: 12.5 points. You can also look at 25 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Women in the Workforce.\n\nAccording to the EU Labor Force Survey, the number of workers in the 55-64 age bracket has remained on a positive trajectory despite an overall decrease in the labor force of the region during the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor force in this bracket is also less likely to undergo serious fluctuations in the long term.\n\nNotable Companies with Large Labor Forces\n\nSome of the largest companies in terms of labor force include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TPE:2317).\n\nWalmart Inc.

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) flew 1,800 store managers to the company's headquarters in 2023. This number is expected to increase in 2024, reaching 2,200.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) employs over 1 million individuals, spread across 10,616 retail units across the globe. The company has recentlyintroduced a new smart shopping cart technology called the Amazon Dash Cart at its stores. This technology-infused cart helps customers add, remove, weigh, and adjust items on their total bill. Additionally, they can skip the checkout line entirely and view discounts and deals on shopping items through the cart's technological features. The Amazon Dash Cart is presently only available at certain Amazon Fresh locations.\n\nThe Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TPE:2317) is a multinational Taiwanese electronics contract manufacturer with around 1 million employees.

        "title": "3 Low-Beta, High-Reward Stocks That Have More Room to Run",
        "content": "You don’t have to be a daredevil to score big gains in the stock market. Sure, high-risk, high-reward plays can supercharge your portfolio if you nail the timing just right on these plays. But for investors who prefer to keep their blood pressure in check, there’s an underrated strategy that lets you have your cake and eat it too.\n\nI’m talking about buying into low-beta, high-reward stocks. These companies are essentially the best of both worlds. They provide plenty of long-term upside potential, but also are limited in terms of their downside risk. With low-beta stocks, the heavy lifting is already done by the company’s solid fundamentals. You can kick back and let compounding work its magic year after year.\n\nOf course, you’ll still want to keep some truly low-risk ballast like bonds or cash in your portfolio for balance. But why resign yourself to low single-digit returns across the board? By sprinkling in a few of these low-beta growth darlings, you can have your portfolio deliver much higher returns over the long-run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the most obvious picks if you’re hunting for a compounder with muted downside risk compared to the broader market, alongside the potential to deliver market-thumping returns over the long-haul. This conglomerate has both an impeccable reputation and a stellar historical track record of execution. These are two essential ingredients for keeping a stock afloat during periods of turbulence, while allowing a given stock to soar when tailwinds are blowing.\n\nWhat’s not to love about Berkshire? The company has the flexibility to nimbly reallocate capital as trends and opportunities shift. Rigid index funds lack that maneuverability. Moreover, Berkshire is invested in a bevy of stalwart blue chips with incredible staying power – companies that will still be thriving decades from now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has admittedly come under fire recently for missing the AI train. But recent leaks point to the tech titan working on a robust on-device AI solution for Siri that could deliver solid performance. And let’s not forget that Apple continues to beat Wall Street’s expectations and remains a fan favorite among Gen Z. The company’s hardware products, which include iPhones and Macs continues to see impressive growth. And Apple’s software ecosystem is still gaining market share hand over fist.\n\nBut Apple is just the tip of the iceberg for Berkshire’s portfolio. The company also owns BNSF Railway, a railroad operator that would command a king’s ransom if it were a publicly-traded entity on its own. With such an incredible mix of cash-gushing businesses powered by the investment prowess of the Oracle of Omaha himself, it’s no wonder Berkshire has so consistently beaten the market.\n\nO’Reilly (ORLY) The front of an O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) store.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nO’Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an automotive parts retailer, and I’ve been pounding the table on the auto parts sector for a while now. Why? Well, the civilian vehicle fleet has been aging at a rapid clip. The average car on the road is already a staggering 13.7 years old in 2024, and that number will likely only continue climbing.\n\nHigh interest rates are dissuading consumers from making big-ticket purchases that come with hefty monthly payments. That dynamic bodes very well for companies like O’Reilly, since folks are more inclined to repair and maintain their existing vehicles rather than buy new ones.\n\nO’Reilly’s financials back up this bullish thesis too. Analysts see O’Reilly’s earnings per share rocketing from around $42 in 2024 to $111 by 2033. Revenues are projected to swell from $17 billion to $27 billion over that same stretch. With growth like that, I’d argue the stock has a lot more gas left in the tank to continue delivering stellar market-beating returns.\n\nDon’t just take my word for it though. O’Reilly has an impressive historical track record, having compounded shareholder wealth by 179% over the past five years. For a mature company operating in the decidedly un-sexy auto parts sector, that’s an astounding feat.\n\nBrown & Brown (BRO) miniature home next to pen, pad of paper, calculator and coins on a desk\n\nSource: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.com\n\nBrown & Brown (NYSE:BRO) is an insurance broker experiencing robust growth thanks to a potent one-two punch of rising rates and an aggressive acquisition strategy. On the pricing front, the company has been able to capitalize on firming insurance premiums. That has been a boon for its business, since Brown & Brown receives commissions based on the policies its clients purchase.\n\nPlus, Brown & Brown has been actively strengthening its core business and expanding its international footprint through strategic M&A. The company’s acquisitions have allowed it to widen its moat and provide more services to its clientele base consisting mainly of small businesses.\n\nA recent peek under the hood reveals just how well this growth strategy is paying off. Brown & Brown’s organic revenue growth remains in the double-digits. Meanwhile, the company’s balance sheet is solid, with ample capital to fuel future growth.\n\nBrown & Brown’s revenues tend to be remarkably steady, since clients need to maintain coverage through thick and thin. That quality makes it one of the low-beta, high-reward stocks that can garner market-beating returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Top Buffett Stock to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Investing icon Warren Buffett built his legend around decades of market-beating value picks. His strategy has changed in recent years, giving a few high-growth tech stocks a place at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) elite table.\n\nYou might think I'm here to recommend Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which is the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio nowadays. Close, but no cigar. I have nothing but respect for the iPhone maker, but its revenue growth has stalled out since 2022, and even Buffett sold 10 million Apple shares last year. The stock still accounts for nearly 42% of Berkshire's stock holdings, but I'm more interested in one of his smaller tech bets.\n\nThat would be Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce retailer and cloud computing pioneer represents just 0.5% of Buffett's stock holdings, and the position is only five years old. However, Buffett is kicking himself for not getting into Amazon earlier -- and it's still one of the most promising tech stocks in today's market.\n\nIf I were starting a long-term portfolio today, Amazon would be one of the first stocks I'd consider. You can buy Amazon shares today, put them under your proverbial pillow, and let them gain value for years or even decades to come.\n\nAmazon's recent roller-coaster ride\n\nThe king of e-commerce in the coronavirus lockdown era lost a step when the inflation crisis started. Amazon's pandemic-inflated sales growth slowed down to a crawl in 2022. At the bottom of that downturn, the company saw $30 billion of negative free cash flow in a single year.\n\nWall Street's reaction was brutal. At the start of 2023, Amazon's stock had fallen 56% from its all-time peak.\n\nI hope you were buying Amazon shares a year ago. As it turns out, the company was busy setting itself up for renewed growth in a healthier economy. Moreover, OpenAI had just kick-started the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy that's expected to power the tech sector for the foreseeable future, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) positioned as a leading platform provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, it wasn't obvious in 2022 that generative AI tools were about to turn the tech sector upside down. The inflation-fighting moves seemed more painful than effective at the time. And Amazon was still burning a ton of cash, adjusting to a weaker retail business and an overly enthusiastic infrastructure expansion during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStill, Amazon always seems to have the right answer for any challenge. Today, its annual free cash flow stands at an all-time high of $32 billion, and year-over-year sales growth has returned to double-digit percentages.\n\nAmazon's stock is also sniffing around record levels again after a two-year retreat. Shares aren't cheap, trading at 64 times trailing earnings and 59 times free cash flow, but I wish I had a dollar for every time people called Amazon \"overvalued\" in its market-stomping three-decade history.\n\nFrom overvalued to invaluable\n\nAlready one of the world's largest and most valuable businesses, Amazon still has a lot of room to continue growing. The AI boom is one active catalyst, along with a vast amount of untapped international opportunity and the fact that old-school brick-and-mortar stores still control 85% of retail activity even in the U.S. market. Amazon's e-commerce muscle can flex much further.\n\nYou shouldn't put all your nest eggs in the Amazon basket, but the stock belongs in any diversified investment portfolio with an eye toward above-average growth prospects. Warren Buffett wishes he had bought Amazon shares earlier, but it's not too late to jump aboard this long-term growth train.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the darling of Wall Street for a while. The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023, and so far this year, its shares are up around 80%.\n\nBut analysts don't expect this sizzling momentum to continue. The consensus price target for Nvidia is barely above its current share price. Here are three \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks Wall Street thinks will soar more than Nvidia over the next 12 months.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a laggard in 2024. It even lost the spot as the biggest company in the world, based on market cap, to Microsoft. However, analysts are more bullish about Apple than any other Magnificent Seven stock right now.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Apple reflects an upside potential of over 9%. Of the 36 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April, 32 rate the stock as a buy or a strong buy. The others recommend holding the stock.\n\nIt might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26.\n\nAnalysts, though, could be anticipating a catalyst with Apple's June developer conference. The company is widely expected to unveil its generative AI strategy at the event.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't delivered Nvidia's jaw-dropping returns. However, the e-commerce and cloud services leader nonetheless pleased investors with a gain of 80% last year and a 20% jump so far this year.\n\nWall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nGenerative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) jumped 58% in 2023. The stock is up over 10% year to date in 2024. Like Apple and Amazon, Alphabet still has more room to run in Wall Street's view.\n\nThe average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy.\n\nAlphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business.\n\nWhy Wall Street could be right\n\nYou can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too.\n\nNvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds.\n\nWall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple's road ahead: New products, diversifying revenue streams will be key to its stock, analysts say",
        "content": "Slowing growth. Rising competition. Widening scrutiny.\n\nApple is falling flat in China and with investors, as the shine comes off of the once darling stock. Shares of the tech giant have declined 8.5% this year, wiping more than $300 billion from its market capitalization, and underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.\n\nHowever, not all is lost. The stock correction is making Apple's valuation more attractive, analysts say, and it's not out of the question that the company wows the world again with new offerings.\n\nCurrently, Apple's stock has fallen 14% from its December peak of $198.11, compared to the S&P 500’s 10% gain and the Nasdaq 100’s nearly 9% climb during the same time.\n\nA number of factors have unnerved investors, including sluggish iPhone demand, intensifying Chinese competition, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nThe growing list of obstacles has prompted more than a few of Martin’s peers to become more bearish on the stock in the short-term. Goldman Sachs removed Apple from its Conviction List last month, while Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic were among firms that have downgraded the stock in 2024.\n\nEarlier this week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah cut his price target on Apple to $170 from $185, and lowered his earnings estimates, writing in a client note that lackluster demand, \"softer fundamentals,\" and competition from Huawei and Xiaomi are having a \"material impact.\"\n\n\"iPhone unit shipments are simply too soft,\" Baruah wrote. \"We currently believe that both Street iPhone units and revenue [estimates] could be 20% too high, and that Wall Street’s overall revenue and EPS [estimates] could be 10% too high.\"\n\nBaruah expects Apple's annual revenue and earnings to decline in 2024 — which has not happened since 2016. SHANGHAI, CHINA - MARCH 23, 2024 - Customers shop at Apple's flagship store, the world's second largest and Asia's largest, in Shanghai, China, March 23, 2024. (Photo credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nAnd Apple's woes in China aren't going away. iPhone sales in the country dropped 24% during the first six weeks of the year, with Apple's market share falling below 16%, according to a Counterpoint Research report. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo holds the largest domestic market share with 17.6%, while Huawei and Honor Device accounted for 16.5% and 16.3%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nTECHnalysis Research's Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance Live that the road ahead for Apple will be challenging, as the region contributed nearly one-fifth of the tech giant’s overall revenue in its most recent quarter.\n\n\"I think the next couple of quarters is going to be tough,\" O’Donnell said. \"I'm hoping that Apple will pull a rabbit out of its hat. It's done so in the past, and I'm not convinced it can't do that now.\"\n\nDespite waning excitement on Wall Street, now may be the time to bet on Apple. The recent selloff has put its shares at a discount, Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live, giving it a more attractive risk-reward set up.\n\n\"Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time, because it’s got a great balance sheet, a highly repeatable business model, good margins, and they're buying back quite a bit of stock,\" Johnson explained.\n\nBeyond its solid balance sheet, several analysts remain confident in the company's ability to regain momentum. The Vision Pro headset and anticipated AI initiatives are largely viewed as future revenue growth drivers, along with additional sources of revenue, including a potential advertising push.\n\n\"Maybe demand is slower in China, but it has really wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem, so they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth,\" Martin said. \"Apple needs to figure out a way to add more services and software so it can get more subscription revenue and up its revenue per device.\"\n\nMartin is among a shortened list of analysts who have maintained a buy rating on Apple. At the start of the second quarter, just over half the analysts covering Apple rated the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. That makes Apple the second least-favored Magnificent 7 stock, behind Tesla.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Smith on Twitter @SeanaNSmith.

        "content": "By Blake Brittain\n\n(Reuters) - Apple urged a U.S. appeals court on Friday to overturn a U.S. trade tribunal's decision to ban imports of some Apple Watches in a patent dispute with medical-monitoring technology company Masimo.\n\nApple told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the U.S. International Trade Commission's decision was based on a \"series of substantively defective patent rulings,\" and that Masimo failed to show it had invested in making competing U.S. products that would justify the order.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing.\n\nIrvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry to its Series 6 Apple Watches in 2020.\n\nMasimo convinced the ITC on Dec. 26 to block imports of Apple's latest-edition Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after finding that their technology for reading blood-oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents.\n\nApple temporarily resumed sales of the watches the next day after persuading the Federal Circuit to pause the ban. The appeals court reinstated the ban in January, leading Apple to remove pulse oximetry capabilities from watches sold during the appeal, which Apple has said could last at least a year.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection separately determined in January that redesigned versions of the watches did not violate Masimo's rights and would not be not subject to the ban. Masimo said in a court filing that the watches \"definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality.\"\n\nApple told the Federal Circuit on Friday that the ban could not stand because a Masimo wearable covered by the patents was \"purely hypothetical\" when it filed its ITC complaint in 2021.\n\nThe tech giant also argued that Masimo's patents were invalid and that its watches did not infringe them.\n\n(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Josie Kao)",

        "content": "Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd (OTC: HNHPF)-owned Foxconn that manufactures iPhones that are the apple of the eye of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its first quarter results. With the first quarter being a typically quiet period, it comes as no surprise that Foxconn posted a revenue dup. However, Foxconn is expecting revenue growth in the second quarter despite it still being an off-peak season.\n\nFirst quarter highlights\n\nFor the first quarter, Foxconn posted a 9.6% drop in revenue, however, Apple supplier noted that its cloud and networking segment reported significant revenue growth. But total revenue amounted to 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars which equates to about $41.2 billion and it was also 28.58% lower compared to the previous, fourth, quarter. But, fourth quarter is usually when suppliers race to enable tech giants like Apple to satisfy the holiday demand. But, according to Counterpoint Research, overall shipments if smartphones declined 3.2% during 2023.\n\nThe AI hype is in the air\n\nAlthough Foxconn is behind AI chipmaking leader, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), it still has gained momentum of late.\n\nView more earnings on HNHPF\n\nAs a reminder, Foxconn teamed up with Nvidia last year. Foxconn and Nvidia joined class to develop certain “AI factories” which are a new class of data centers that use Nvidia chips to power all kinds of applications ranging from large language models to training autonomous vehicles. Also, Foxconn will develop smart solution platforms that are based on technologies that Nvidia developed. By gaining access to Nvidia’s solutions, Foxconn will get to offer safe AI-powered EVs and make its mark in the new era. In simple words, Nvidia joined forces with Foxconn on its path to accelerate the AI Industrial Revolution. Considering that AI development requires more than chips, there is room for all kinds of industrial contributors as even the all-mighty Nvidia cannot do everything alone, which bodes well for Foxconn.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the traditional off-peak period and a recent earthquake, higher March revenue from consumer-electronics and cloud demand fueled Apple supplier to expect revenue growth in the second quarter. Also, Foxconn shares rose almost 21% year-to-date.\n\nRebound hopes are based on AI\n\nAlthough the sales slump offers little hope for the rebound of the Apple star, the iPhone, , the growing demand for AI servers empowered Foxconn to expect a revenue rebound in the second quarter and be optimistic for the year ahead.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. For a quick overview of the 5 such stocks, read our article5 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nYet another stronger-than-expected jobs report published on Friday is further dampening investors’ hopes of seeing the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June. Analysts have started to predict that the Federal Reserve might further delay its first rate cut to avoid seeing a strong rebound in inflation down the road. Piper Sandler said in its fresh note that latest data is showing the US labor market is “even stronger than we thought and maybe getting stronger.” Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, also said in a note that investors are beginning to digest the possibility of not seeing three rate cuts this year. He thinks the Fed could cut rates twice this year, but it’s still early to say anything.\n\nPossibility of No Rate Cuts in 2024?\n\nMoving expectations from three rate cuts to two won’t be a big deal for the market, given the resilience of the labor market, strong household savings and the AI revolution that keeps pushing stocks higher. But what if the Fed kills the possibility of any rate cuts this year because of sticky inflation and strong hiring? A few months ago this would have sounded like an impossible thing to say. Today, it’s totally a possibility.\n\n\"If the economy is running the way it's running now through most of this year, then it might be likely that the Fed does not cut interest rates this year,” Saglimbene added.\n\nCan Smaller Companies Benefit from the AI Rally? Taking Guidance from History\n\nDespite this backdrop, more and more market experts have been saying that the AI-led rally that boosted large-cap tech stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and many others, is starting to broaden out to smaller companies. They say for long-term investors it’s time to pile into small-cap stocks in the technology sector. Hartford Funds in a report last month said that historically, large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks but this trend averages out and reverses after ten years. The report noted that small-cap companies have been trading at low forward P/E ratios when compared to their large-cap counterparts for years, and if we use history as our guide, a “switch to small-cap outperformance is due.”\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in High-Quality Small-Cap Stocks\n\nThe last thing any sane investor would want in this uncertain environment is volatility and turbulence. So why would it make sense to invest in penny stocks or small companies? After all small-cap stocks have become synonymous with volatility. Small-cap proponents say that not all small-cap stocks are equal. For long-term investors who want to make money investing, opportunities lie in the small-cap universe. A GMO report published in 2022 talked about the importance of investing high quality small-cap stocks. What are high quality small-cap stocks? According to GMO, which said it has been investing small-cap quality stocks since 2004 as part of its “Quality Strategy”, high quality companies have “high margins, high returns on capital, low debt, and stable fundamentals.” This is what the firm found out about high quality small-cap companies:\n\n“High-quality small cap companies have delivered stronger returns than the small cap universe, with lower volatility. Since 1976, small cap quality has outperformed the small cap asset class in the U.S. by 1.8% annualized and has also outperformed the all-cap U.S. market by 2.8% annualized. These more predictable, long-term winners are very often undervalued by the market, buried under the buzz of stocks long on narrative but short on fundamental stability.”\n\nPerformance of Small Companies So Far in 2024\n\nBut how have small-cap and micro-cap stocks been performing this year? Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT), which invests in small-cap technology stocks, is up just 5.80% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500’s return of 27%. So far this year, the ETF is down 3.56%. But artificial intelligence is doing its wonders in the small-cap space too, since smaller names like Super Micro and MicroStrategy, part of the small-cap focused Russell 2000, poste huge returns on the back of the AI wave. A recent Wall Street Journal report said, citing data from LSEG, that these two companies collectively accounted for about a third of the Russell 2000’s 5.2% return in the first quarter.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this backdrop, it would be interesting to see which smaller tech companies hedge funds are investing in. In this article we first scanned Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds and their holdings and picked 11 penny technology stocks (trading under $5) with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now\n\n11. Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nMobile advertising and app growth solutions company Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) ranks 11th in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in now according to hedge funds.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds had stakes in Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS).

Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nVirginia-based IT and cybersecurity company Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) ranks 10th in our list of the best technology penny stocks hedge funds are piling into.

Unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), TLS is a small company that does not get much attention from the market.\n\n9. GoPro Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\n7. 8X8 Inc.  (NASDAQ:EGHT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 21\n\nVoice over IP products and solutions company 8X8 Inc. (NASDAQ:EGHT) ranks seventh in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. In February, Bank of America published a list of buy-rated small cap value stocks.

        "content": "One of the more magnificent of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the hearts of many investors is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). They keep their positions in the tech giant on hopes of further growth from its selection of appealing devices, and the company's ever-widening software ecosystem.\n\nMore than a few analysts tracking the stock believe in the company's future too. One of them recently reiterated his view that the shares could appreciate by 30%. Even for Apple, however, that's a chunky growth rate. Is it realistically achievable?\n\nEvercore ISI remains in the bull camp\n\nFollowing an update from Apple on the performance of its App Store, Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani felt compelled to publish a fresh research note on the company.\n\nThe tech giant did well with its app marketplace. Total revenue from it rose by 13% in March with growth occurring in all categories, according to the analyst. Daryanani feels that gives the company a fine chance at exceeding its guidance for 11% growth in services revenue for its yet-to-be-reported second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the prognosticator wrote in his note that \"the strength of the March print increases our confidence that Apple can maintain App Store growth in the double digits.\"\n\nIs Apple losing its shine?\n\nDaryanani's positive take on Apple is in some contrast to the more cautious analysts tracking the stock. Some are concerned that the once-mighty iPhone is losing a bit of its luster due to weakening demand and lower-priced competition. The device did see a 24% year-over-year tumble in sales in the crucial market of China in the first six weeks of this year, after all.\n\nAs a longtime Apple bull and determined holder of the stock, I lean more toward Daryanani's argument. Hardware sales are critical and foundational, of course, but the company has made bigger strides with services. These grew by 11% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, against the essentially stagnant development of product sales. This should buoy the company's overall growth, and keep its investors sweet.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy.\n\nWith the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.\n\nIn addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nThough a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines.\n\nA potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.\n\nMatching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Tim Cook also cancelled efforts to develop a self-driving car - BROOKS KRAFT/APPLE\n\nApple is cutting more than 600 jobs after abandoning its decade-long efforts to build an electric car.\n\nThe redundancies are the first at Apple since the pandemic and are happening at Silicon Valley offices believed to house parts of its electric car project.\n\nA team working on new screen technology is also being shut down. Apple revealed the lay-offs in state filings in California.\n\nIt comes after Tim Cook cancelled the company’s efforts to develop a self-driving car, dubbed Project Titan, which reportedly had over 2,000 staff.\n\nThe project was launched in secret in 2014 and has since gone through repeated restructurings and leadership changes as Apple grappled with how to enter the fiercely competitive automotive industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt one point, Apple had planned to build a fully autonomous vehicle that could drive itself. The company operated a test fleet of self-driving cars on California’s roads.\n\nLast year, it had 67 Lexus SUVs registered with Californian officials that had been vetted to test its software.\n\nThe decision to ditch the electric vehicle comes as global demand for battery-powered cars wanes.\n\nThe cars remain more expensive than petrol equivalents at the budget end of the market, while high inflation has dampened demand for new cars overall.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla’s shares fell by more than 5pc after it disappointed investors with a report that deliveries of its popular electric cars had fallen sharply.\n\nThe job cuts at Apple include hundreds of roles in the Californian city of Santa Clara, according to state filings. Earlier this year, Apple also cut 121 jobs from an office in San Diego.\n\nUnlike other tech giants such as Google and Meta, Apple has largely avoided such public mass redundancies. While it has given up on its electric vehicle dream, Apple has shifted its efforts towards embedding more powerful artificial intelligence technology in its gadgets.\n\nBloomberg reported on Wednesday that it is also planning a push into home robotics. Apple still has a presence in millions of cars through its CarPlay software, a hands-free system that links to drivers’ iPhones and is used by hundreds of different marques including from BMW and Ford.\n\nApple’s shares have languished so far this year as investors grow wary over its growth potential. Its stock is down 9pc since the turn of the year and it has lost its place as the world’s most valuable company.",

        "title": "INSIGHT-Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data",
        "content": "By Katie Paul and Anna Tong\n\nNEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market.\n\nToday only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life.\n\nCEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.\n\nHe has discussed rates of between 5 cents and $1 dollar per photo and more than $1 per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought.\n\n\"We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more,' Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has.\n\n\"You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?\"\n\nPhotobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology.\n\nTech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice.\n\nAt the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,\" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training.\n\nReuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materializing, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent.\n\nOpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions.\n\nGoogle added that it would \"take immediate action, up to and including termination\" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation.\n\nMany major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly $2.5 billion now and forecast it could grow close to $30 billion within a decade.\n\nGENERATIVE DATA GOLD RUSH\n\nThe data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI \"foundation\" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as \"training\" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete.\n\nTech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as \"publicly available.\"\n\nTheir approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping.\n\nIn response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand.\n\nIn the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements.\n\nThe deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from $25 million to $50 million each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's Chief Financial Officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh \"flurry of activity\" in the past two months, he added.\n\nYahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public.\n\nA Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers.\n\nOpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organizations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details.\n\n'ETHICALLY SOURCED' CONTENT\n\nAn industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data.\n\nSeattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters.\n\nRates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay $1 to $2 per image, $2 to $4 per short-form video and $100 to $300 per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is $0.001 per word, she added.\n\nImages of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for $5 to $7, she said.\n\nDefined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as \"ethically sourced,\" as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added.\n\nOne of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts.\n\nThe priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity.\n\nTo fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said.\n\nHe said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities.\n\nHis company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymize and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added.\n\n'I WOULD FIND IT RISKY'\n\nWhile licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed.\n\nAI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent.\n\nPhotobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the \"unrestricted right\" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads.\n\n\"We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,\" he said.\n\nDefined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from \"platform\" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights.\n\n\"I would find it very risky,\" Braga said of platform content. \"If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem.\"\n\nPhotobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with \"select AI companies.\" In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models.\n\nAhead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations.\n\nThe FTC, which warned businesses in February against retroactively changing terms of service for AI usage, declined to comment on the Reddit inquiry or say whether it was looking into other training data deals.

        "title": "Forget Apple: Warren Buffett Has Spent Twice as Much Buying Shares of This Beloved Stock Since 2018",
        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been lapping the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column. As of the closing bell on March 28, 2024, the S&P 500 had gained in the neighborhood of 34,400%, including dividends paid, since Buffett took the reins. In comparison, the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a jaw-dropping aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,126,746% since the mid-1960s!\n\nBoth professional and retail investors frequently await Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain an understanding of what stocks Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling. While Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding value in plain sight. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nSomething else Warren Buffett is known for is portfolio concentration. Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his team are overseeing a $373 billion portfolio containing 45 stocks and two index funds, the vast majority of Berkshire's invested assets have been put to work in just a few companies -- the \"top ideas.\"\n\nWhile 13Fs would give investors the impression that tech titanApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is Buffett's unquestioned favorite stock -- Berkshire's Apple stake accounts for 42% ($155 billion) of invested assets -- a deeper dive into how Berkshire Hathaway puts its cash to work points to another even more beloved stock as the Oracle's cream of the crop.\n\n\"A better business than any we own\"\n\nLet me preface this discussion by noting that Warren Buffett and his team of investors absolutely love Apple as a business. In fact, Buffett himself described Apple as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting last year. It's why an estimated $36 billion has been put to work by Buffett and Co. in shares of Apple since the start of 2016.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for Buffett to feel the way he does about Apple. To start with, it's one of the most valuable brands globally, and it sports an exceptionally loyal customer base. A brand study conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 notes that iPhone users are more likely to stick with Apple for their next smartphone purchase than Samsung owners are to buy another Samsung smartphone.\n\nThere's also the domestic dominance of Apple's iPhone. Since introducing an iPhone that supports 5G speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has consistently accounted for a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market.\n\nHowever, the company's future growth boils down to its shift to subscription services. Although Apple has no intention of abandoning the physical products that brought it fame (the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), focusing on subscription services should provide a lift to its operating margin, enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, and keep customers loyal to its brand.\n\nBut if you asked Warren Buffett to pinpoint the one aspect about Apple he loves most, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if he flagged Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, Apple has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only do buybacks help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS), they're a means to increase the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. As time passes, Berkshire is becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to buy a single share.\n\nBut the fact remains that the estimated $36 billion Warren Buffett and his team have put to work in Apple over the past eight years takes a back seat to an even more loved stock. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett has purchased more than $74 billion of this stock since 2018\n\nTruth be told, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs fail to tell the full story about the company's holdings or what the Oracle of Omaha has been doing with Berkshire's cash. For a more encompassing view, investors will need to dive into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results.\n\nJust prior to the executive certifications at the end of Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly earnings reports is a section on the company's share repurchase activity. The reason I bring this up is because Warren Buffett has spent considerably more buying back Berkshire Hathaway stock than he and his top aides have spent purchasing shares of any other stock, including Apple.\n\nDuring the December-ended quarter, Buffett gave the green light for the repurchase of 3,623 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B), which came at a cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the midpoint of 2018, Buffett and his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who he referred to as the \"Architect of Berkshire Hathaway\" in his latest annual letter to shareholders, OK'd the repurchase of more than $74 billion worth of their own company's shares. That's more than twice the amount spent buying shares of Apple.\n\nPrior to July 2018, Berkshire's share repurchase program only allowed the Oracle of Omaha to buy shares of his company if they traded at or below 120% of book value (no more than 20% of reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire stock never fell to or below this threshold, Warren Buffett was forced to sit on his hands and go years without repurchasing a single share.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked its buyback criteria:\n\nAs long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet; and Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agree their stock is intrinsically cheap, buybacks can be made without any end date or ceiling.\n\nSuffice it to say, more than $74 billion in share repurchases over the last 22 quarters makes it plainly obvious that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.\n\nSince Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are the easiest way he can reward investors who share his long-term vision. These buybacks are slowly but steadily increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, as well as increasing EPS. In other words, putting his company's cash to work via buybacks is making Berkshire Hathaway more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nWith a record $167.6 billion in available cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on the balance sheet, as of the end of 2023, Buffett has more than enough firepower to continue buying back shares of his company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

The company is diversifying its business with greater focus on building data center server racks and other equipment for artificial intelligence clusters. That’s helped its stock reach a record high this year, despite sales of Apple Inc.’s flagship device waning in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.\n\nFor the current quarter, Hon Hai said it expects sales to grow relative to the same period a year earlier — in line with projections for an 8% rise. The company also anticipates sales to be up for the full year. The AI craze has brought big gains in companies like Nvidia Corp. as investors see massive growth potential for the sector. Foxconn’s AI server revenue is likely to account for 18% of its total sales in 2025, due to a rising share of Nvidia shipments, JPMorgan analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note late March.\n\nStill, with Apple’s business making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. iPhone shipments in China fell 33% in February, to only about 2.4 million, according to official data. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates with additional details from Hon Hai filing)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane China’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia’s move to get more goods produced onshore is already starting to backfire, with companies warning that supplies of products including Apple Inc.’s MacBook Pro could start to run out as soon as the end of April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas Toll Road Takeover to Cost Taxpayers at Least $1.7 Billion Saudi Crown Prince MBS’s $100 Billion Foreign Investment Quest Falters S&P 500 Falls 1% as Oil Jump Spurs Flight to Bonds: Markets Wrap Giving Up China Is Hard, Even for Argentina’s Anarcho-Capitalist Biden Tells Netanyahu US Support Hinges on Protecting Civilians\n\nOther goods including Michelin tires and chemicals shipped from Europe may run out over the next few months because of the rule enforced from March 10 that’s seen as an attempt to curb imports of thousands of products, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile the move was meant to spur global companies to set up production plants onshore, it has instead pushed them to consider scaling back or canceling plans to expand operations, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing sensitive information.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo has presented himself as business-friendly to foreign investors, but he has also railed against imports that compete against local products. That tension is coming to the fore as the import hurdles have ignited furor among top executives at companies from Apple to Michelin and spurred business chambers from the US to South Korea to write letters to his government to review the matter, said the people who asked not to be named discussing sensitive issues.\n\nRepresentatives from Apple as well as Indonesia’s ministries of trade and industry didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMichelin said it has been working with associations and other companies facing a similar issue, and it’s optimistic the government will act soon to fix the problem. “Michelin aims at integrating Indonesia fully into its global value chain, and that is why openness to trade is key to us,” it said in an emailed response to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe complex rule effectively restricts imports of about 4,000 products, including finished goods such as laptops and raw materials like hazardous chemicals. To get import permits, companies must get a letter of recommendation from the Ministry of Industry, but the process is onerous — requiring firms to submit tenancy agreements and annual forecasts of items they intend to bring into the country, said the people.\n\nThe forecasts may be used by the government to set import quotas for certain products, which the companies view as being meant to spur them to set up production facilities onshore to get an upper hand or lose out to rivals because of the quota mechanism, they said.\n\nDespite multiple queries from the companies, the government didn’t give any clarity on the implementation since the rule was signed into law in December, the people said. Firms only understood the complexity and ramifications once the regulation was enforced, which is throwing companies into turmoil as they need to plan budgets, logistics and transport for the goods, they said.\n\nFirms are now turning to Coordinating Investment and Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Panjaitan, who’s seen as someone who has Jokowi’s ear, to persuade the president to ease the rule. In private conversations, Panjaitan described the rule as potentially injuring Indonesia’s business reputation and economic interests, the people said.\n\nA representative for Panjaitan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Eddie Spence and Eko Listiyorini.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Elon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future Fixing Boeing’s Broken Culture Starts With a New Plane China’s Real Estate Tycoons Lost $100 Billion in the Housing Collapse\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "7 Nancy Pelosi Stocks Still Worth Buying in Q2",
        "content": "In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market.\n\nThat’s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let’s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you’re going to disagree with that last point. That’s okay. The point is you can’t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress.\n\nWell, maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Let’s move on – below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it’s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.\n\nFundamentally, it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What’s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it’s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50. That’s a significant increase over last year’s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that’s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023’s $6.89 billion tally. It’s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there’s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there’s also a solid chance you’re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy.\n\nYes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That’s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can’t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don’t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That’s a decent bump from last year’s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we’re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year’s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I’m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft’s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to.\n\nYes, the spotlight centers on the company’s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It’s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year’s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we’re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year’s haul of $211.91 billion.\n\nI think it’s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE:AXP). Don’t get me wrong – I think it’s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I’m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.\n\nLet’s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies, AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It’s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts’ EPS targets.\n\nLooking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $11.21. For revenue, we’re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023’s tally of $60.52 billion.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nTo start, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It’s understandable. While the entertainment giant – which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts – commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year’s revenue. Nevertheless, it’s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it’s worth considering.\n\nIn Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts’ EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That’s earnings growth if I’ve ever seen it.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year’s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it’s a solid wager.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nThe former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had.\n\nOne of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it’s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet’s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn’t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That’s a big jump from last year’s print of $5.80. Also, they’re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we’re talking a large gap from last year’s result of $307.39 billion.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we come to the riskiest idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks, financial technology (fintech) stalwart PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). It’s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I’d say it’s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it’s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that’s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.\n\nStill, I’m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It’s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That’s a bit disappointing compared to last year’s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year’s tally of $29.77 billion. It’s worth looking into if you’re a contrarian.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple Explores Home Robotics as Potential ‘Next Big Thing’ After Car Fizzles",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, a field with the potential to become one of the company’s ever-shifting “next big things,” according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTSMC Facilities to Resume Production Overnight After Quake Kim Jong Un Faces Annihilation in Most Korea War Scenarios A Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead Trump Media’s Business Doesn’t Matter Trump Got His $175 Million Bond From a Billionaire Fan’s Company\n\nEngineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.\n\nThough the effort is still in the beginning stages — and it’s unclear if the products will ultimately be released — Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.\n\nWith robotics, Apple could gain a bigger foothold in consumers’ homes and capitalize on advances in artificial intelligence. But it’s not yet clear what approach it might take. Though the robotic smart display is much further along than the mobile bot, it has been added and removed from the company’s product road map over the years, according to the people.\n\nThe robotics work is happening within Apple’s hardware engineering division and its AI and machine-learning group, which is run by John Giannandrea. Matt Costello and Brian Lynch — two executives focused on home products — have overseen the hardware development. Still, Apple hasn’t committed to either project as a company, and the work is still considered to be in the early research phase. A spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple investors reacted coolly to the news, with the stock paring earlier gains after Bloomberg reported on the robotics work. It was up less than 1% at $169.65 at the close in New York. Shares of Roomba maker iRobot Corp., meanwhile, briefly jumped as much as 17% — a sign investors thought it might benefit from Apple’s interest in the field. But the rally faded, and the stock gained less than 2% by the close.\n\nBefore the EV project was canceled, Apple told its top executives that the company’s future revolved around three areas: automotive, the home and mixed reality. But now the car isn’t happening and Apple has already released its first mixed-reality product, the Vision Pro headset. So the focus has shifted to other future opportunities, including how Apple can better compete in the smart home market.\n\nRead More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace Headsets\n\nThe table-top robotics project first excited senior Apple executives a few years ago, including hardware engineering chief John Ternus and members of the industrial design team. The idea was to have the display mimic the head movements — such as nodding — of a person on a FaceTime session. It would also have features to precisely lock on to a single person among a crowd during a video call.\n\nBut the company has been concerned about whether consumers would be willing to pay top dollar for such a device. There have also been technical challenges related to balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand. The primary obstacle has been disagreement among Apple executives over whether to move forward with the product at all, according to the people.\n\nNear its campus in Cupertino, California, Apple has a secret facility that resembles the inside of a house — a site where it can test future devices and initiatives for the home. Apple has been exploring other ideas for that market, including a new home hub device with an iPad-like display.\n\nApple’s pursuit of the “next big thing” has been an obsession since the Steve Jobs era. But it’s become harder to envision a product that could ever match the iPhone, which accounted for 52% of the company’s $383.3 billion in sales last year.\n\nA car had the potential to add hundreds of billions of dollars to Apple’s revenue, in part because the vehicles were expected to sell for roughly $100,000 a pop. Few other products have that kind of growth potential, but Apple has a number of projects in the works, including an updated Vision Pro, touch-screen Macs, AirPods with built-in cameras, and new health technologies like a noninvasive blood sugar monitor.\n\nArtificial intelligence is another major focus, even if Apple is playing catch-up in the realm of chatbots and other generative technology. That’s where there could be some overlap with the robotics work. While still in the earliest stages, Apple AI researchers are investigating the use of algorithms to help bots navigate cluttered spaces within people’s homes.\n\nRead More: Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to Antitrust: QuickTake\n\nIf the work advances, Apple wouldn’t be the first tech giant to develop a home robot. Amazon.com Inc. introduced a model called Astro in 2021 that currently costs $1,600. But the company was slow to offer the device in major quantities, and it remains a niche product. The company debuted a more business-focused version of the rolling bot last year designed to work as a security guard.\n\nPerhaps the most popular home robot remains the Roomba vacuum, which debuted more than two decades ago. Amazon agreed to acquire iRobot in 2022, but regulatory opposition ultimately doomed the deal. Other companies have also presented the idea of humanoid robots that mimic the size and movements of people.\n\nA silver lining to Apple’s failed car endeavor is that it provided the underpinnings for other initiatives. The neural engine — the company’s AI chip inside of iPhones and Macs — was originally developed for the car. The project also laid the groundwork for the Vision Pro because Apple investigated the use of virtual reality while driving.\n\nThe robot work got a similar start, originating within Apple’s Titan car project around 2019. That’s when the effort was run by Doug Field, now a top EV executive at Ford Motor Co.\n\nAt the time, Field tapped a series of executives to work on robotics initiatives, ranging from nearly silent indoor drones to home robots. The group included Lynch; Nick Sims, a former Google home products manager; and Dave Scott, who left Apple in 2021 to briefly run a mobile MRI machine company and then returned in 2022 to work on the Vision Pro. Hanns Wolfram Tappeiner, the co-founder of AI and robotics company Anki, is also involved.\n\nSoon after Field left Apple in 2021, the robotics work was shifted to the home devices group. And at least one former hardware team from the shuttered car project was recently repurposed to the work on home devices and robotics. The car’s operating system — dubbed by some as safetyOS — could also theoretically be tailored for robots, according to people familiar with the effort.\n\nThe original concept for the robot was a device that could navigate entirely on its own without human intervention — like the car — and serve as a videoconferencing tool. One pie-in-the-sky idea within Apple was having it be able to handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink. But that would require overcoming extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges — something that’s unlikely this decade.\n\nOn its website, Apple is advertising for robotics-related roles, indicating that it’s trying to expand the teams working on the project.\n\n“Our team works at the intersection of modern machine learning and robotics to shape the AI that will power the next generation of Apple products,” according to the description of one job. “We are looking for innovative and hardworking ML and robotics researchers and engineers that help us research, define, and develop complex intelligent robotic systems and experiences in the real world.”\n\n(Updates share reaction in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s X Has a Porn Problem How Bluey Became a $2 Billion Smash Hit—With an Uncertain Future EV Rise Helps BYD Overtake Geely to Become China’s Car King How Hertz’s Bet on Teslas Went Horribly Sideways Canada’s RBC Struggles to Go Green While Financing Oil\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "The good, bad, and ugly of Big Tech's first quarter",
        "content": "The tech industry had a wild first quarter. From Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock price continuing to rocket higher and higher to Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) botched launch of its Gemini image generator and Apple’s antitrust battle, the first three months of the year were full of highs, lows, and, well, even lower lows.\n\nThe quarter was also full of surprises. Meta (META) announced its first dividend payment and a larger stock buyback program and Apple (AAPL), according to Bloomberg, decided to kill its long-gestating car program, putting an end to an effort that would have catapulted the company into the automotive industry.\n\nSpeaking of autos, EVs took it on the chin as sales fell off a cliff. And the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union’s European Commission began sniffing around companies’ AI investments and more.\n\nOh, and did I mention Congress has revived efforts to ban TikTok in the US? Yes, it’s been a busy three months. And we still have nine more to go. These are the good, the bad, and the ugly stories of the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe good\n\nLet’s kick things off with the good news for the tech industry in the first quarter. First up is Nvidia, which continues to dominate the AI conversation. In February, the company announced another monster quarter, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations on revenue and earnings and beating out anticipated revenue for the current quarter.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up some 89% year to date and 226% over the last 12 months. And in March, the company debuted its new Blackwell AI processor architecture during its GTC conference, which felt more like a party than a developer event.\n\nAlso this quarter, Intel and the White House announced that the chipmaker is getting $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding to help build out its chip manufacturing and research and development facilities at plants across the US. Nvidia's founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the annual Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on March 18, 2024. (Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe cash from the CHIPS Act is meant to revitalize the US semiconductor industry, and with Intel starting to build chips for third-party companies like Microsoft, it should benefit handsomely from the funding.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, meanwhile, made headlines for ending its electric car project. According to Bloomberg, the company is going to transition a number of employees who worked on the car to its AI division, at a time when Wall Street is looking for signs that the iPhone maker is taking the generative AI trend seriously. Killing the project also means that Apple will avoid what could have been a costly rollout amid a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the US.\n\nFinally, Meta announced during its first quarter earnings report that it will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share and authorized an additional $50 billion for stock buybacks, sending shares of the company skyrocketing 38% year to date and 131% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe bad\n\nThings weren’t all good for tech in the first quarter. Case in point, the FTC announced it is launching an inquiry into Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) investments in generative AI firms including Anthropic and OpenAI. Alphabet and Amazon have both invested billions in Anthropic, while Microsoft has pumped billions into OpenAI.\n\nThe FTC says the move will “help the agency deepen enforcers understanding of the investments and partnerships formed between generative AI developers and cloud service providers.”\n\nThe upshot? The FTC is keeping its eye on Big Tech’s efforts to capture as much of the AI market as possible, and whether those companies are grabbing too much power. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, left, appears onstage with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at OpenAI's first developer conference on Nov. 6, 2023, in San Francisco. (Barbara Ortutay/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt’s not just the FTC keeping its eyes on tech companies either. The European Union’s competition watchdog, the European Commission (EC), is looking into whether Apple, Google, and Meta are complying with the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nThe DMA is meant to force large tech companies to open up their services to prevent them from dominating specific markets. The EC isn’t so sure they’re playing ball though, and are looking into whether they’re complying or not.\n\nThe hits kept coming for Google during the quarter, after it botched the launch of its flagship generative AI-powered Gemini image generator. Users found the app produced images of multicultural Nazis among other things, forcing the company to pull the app.\n\nCongress also got in on the action, looking to, yet again, take down TikTok, with the House passing legislation that would force parent company ByteDance to sell the social network or keep Apple and Google from offering it in their app stores. The Senate still has to take action on the measure, but First Amendment concerns could prevent any ban from sticking.\n\nThe ugly\n\nNothing is as bad as these stories though: Up top, the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The DOJ claims Apple is boxing out competition and hurting developers, and ultimately consumers, by keeping a tight grip on its App Store and hardware. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAccording to the suit, Apple locks competitors out from being able to access features that would let them take on the Apple Wallet and Apple Watch. Apple refutes the claims, but the suit could take years to wrap up and may prove to be a distraction for its future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk filed a lawsuit of his own against OpenAI, the company he co-founded, claiming that the AI firm has abandoned its original mission to create AI technologies that benefit humanity. Musk says that OpenAI is more focused on profits and is a subsidiary of Microsoft. OpenAI has fired back, refuting Musk’s claims and saying that he’s more or less upset that he missed the boat on the company’s explosive growth.\n\nFinally, there’s the electric vehicle market. Sales of EVs are slowing in the US as subsidies for certain models dry up and sky-high interest rates are making it harder for consumers to purchase models. Then there's lingering range anxiety about a car running out of power mid-drive. The general thinking is that EVs will eventually become the dominant type of vehicle on the road in the next decade or so, but for now, the jump in sales seen over the past few years is falling flat.\n\nIt’s still early in the year — heck, baseball season just started, though my Mets are already in the basement. That is to say, the good stories could flip and become bad or ugly and vice versa. On to Q2.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 1 Other Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC tried to get to the bottom of the recent market decline amid rising yields and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plan. Cramer said that the latest market decline was not \"consequential\" because if the upcoming jobs report comes in weaker than expected, the market will rebound as people would expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to avoid a hard landing. Cramer said it's been a while since we saw a broader selloff, so we \"forgot\" how to \"handle\" one.\n\nCramer Explains the \"Real\" Reasons Behind the Latest Selloff\n\nThe CNBC host tried to get to the \"real reasons\" behind the latest selloff and found them in earnings, which he said are always important for him. Cramer first talked about payroll solutions company Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) which recently posted downbeat sales for the fiscal third quarter ending February 29, 2024. Cramer specifically highlighted Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO comments delivered during the company's latest earnings call where he talked about some trends he's seeing in the jobs market.\n\n\"But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now.\n\nOur clients tell us they still can’t find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients.\" [read the full earnings call transcript here.]\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer then turned to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he believes does not deserve to be in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks anymore. Cramer said that the problems Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing have to do with the overall declining demand for EVs in the US. He said Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing what Ford and GM had already faced.\n\nCramer said that the \"real problem\" with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is that it turned out to be a car company instead of an \"immortal tech company.\" However, Cramer said Tesla is a \"headline grabber\" and it always will be.\n\nCramer Recommends Investors to \"Hunker Down\" and Wait\n\nJim Cramer reiterated that we should always expect a 10% pullback on average every two years, based on the analysis of legendary economist Peter Lynch.  He also said that there weren’t \"many\" stocks that saw declines in the latest selloff. Instead, he thinks most of the losses were seen by individual stocks based on specific events and catalysts. Cramer thinks the market was overbought and the selloff was due, and he said it's not over yet. Cramer recommend investors to \"hunker down\" and wait for the markets to rebound.\n\nJim Cramer has been recommending mega-cap quality names like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past few months as he's highly bullish on the AI revolution that is boosting several names under his coverage. Jim Cramer is Talking About Trump Media and 10 Other Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC over the past few weeks and picked some of the most important stocks he discussed. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, where applicable. But why is it important to keep tabs on hedge fund activity? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nOn March 26, when Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) was skyrocketing, Cramer said on CNBC that if I were Donald Trump \"this is the moment\" when you'd say it's time to release more shares.\n\n\"I am not sure where Mr. Trump's head is, but this is a moment where he could say, look, the stock's up 286%. No one would mind if I sold stock, so please let me do it.\"\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) shares have pared gains since. The stock is down 26% over the past five days as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) recently revealed that it had a net loss of about $58 million in 2023, while revenue in the period was $4.1 million.\n\n10. AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 14\n\nJim Cramer is highly bearish on mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). A caller recently asked Cramer whether he should buy AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) stock for dividends. Cramer’s reply was a resounding “No.” He asked the questioner to see how the stock has performed over the past few years, or “any period” for that matter. Cramer said this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” Cramer is bearish on AGNC but recommends buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  for the long term.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 14 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). The biggest stakeholder of AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC) during this period was Karim Abbadi and Edward Mcbride’s Centiva Capital which owns a $16 million stake in AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC).\n\n9. Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nWater handling and recycling solutions company Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about recently. Cramer said that he’s a bit late to the stock since Aris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have “almost doubled.” Cramer said he’d wait for a pullback in the stock price.\n\n“Let’s see if we can get it back to $10.”\n\nAris Water Solutions Inc (NYSE:ARIS) shares have gained about 64% so far this year.\n\n8. Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nTexas-based software company Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) stock is a Buy, according to Jim Cramer. When asked about the stock, Cramer said that it's a very \"well-run\" company. He also said that a government business is a \"good business.\"\n\nTyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) is one of the stocks seeing heavy insider selling activity this year. John S Marr Jr, Tyler Technologies Inc's (NYSE:TYL) former CEO and current executive chairman of the board, sold 7,500 shares of Tyler Technologies Inc (NYSE:TYL) on March 13 at $425.07 per share.\n\nHere is what Andvari Associates has to say about Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“After good results for the first half of the year, Andvari’s performance suffered at the end of the third quarter for two reasons. First, renewed fears of interest rates remaining higher for longer impacted multiple holdings that are most sensitive to rates. Companies with high growth prospects, like Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), also declined. A third group also declined: our investments in fixed income and preferred securities for retirement accounts naturally declined in value as the prices of these securities go down when interest rates go up.”\n\n7. Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on automated electronic broker platform company Interactive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR). When asked about the stock in a latest program, Cramer said that it’s an “incredibly well-run company” and “everybody feels that way.” In the same vein Jim Cramer also recommended investors to consider buying Charles Schwab shares. In addition to IBKR, Cramer is recommending Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nInteractive Brokers Gorup, Inc (NASDAQ:IBKR) shares have gained about 39% over the past one year.\n\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In Financials, we prefer well-placed insurance companies and niche businesses while tending to avoid banks which face credit deterioration and rising deposit costs. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) operates as an automated electronic broker worldwide. Third quarter’s earnings were above consensus estimates, aided by the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses. Despite the beat, its shares lost -4% due to reduced expectations around inorganic account growth as two new Asian broker relationships have been pushed out.”\n\n6. Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 51\n\nJim Cramer hit the “Buy, Buy, Buy” button on Texas-based construction engineering company Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) during a latest Lightning Round segment of his program Mad Money on CNBC. Cramer said that Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is “just fantastic.” He said Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) is a great infrastructure player.\n\n“I think you’ve got a winner there.”\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Along with DexCom, notable adds in the quarter included Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) and Jabil. Quanta provides outsourced skilled labor for maintenance and construction services, primarily to utilities. We have followed the company for over a decade and have witnessed its shift from oil and gas to renewables. The energy transition (solar and wind farms, electric vehicles, etc.) requires investments in the US energy grid to support greater electrification. At the same time, climate change is increasing stress on the existing grid, forcing utilities to increase maintenance spending. Furthermore, Federal incentive programs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, will help fuel Quanta’s long-term growth given its expertise in transmission and distribution connections as renewable energy infrastructure seeks to connect to the grid. The stock sold off early in the quarter on concerns that higher interest rates would lead to a pullback in renewables investments by utility customers. However, based on our industry research, we think Quanta’s key customers are well resourced and committed to meeting long-term electrification needs via infrastructure investment. We used the selloff as an opportunity to move the position into the CropSM at a more attractive valuation.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer is Talking About These5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Says You Should ‘Buy, Buy, Buy’ These 11 Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, the bulls are running wild on Wall Street. Following the 2022 bear market, all three major stock indexes -- the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and widely tracked Nasdaq Composite -- have recently reached record-closing highs.\n\nWhile a number of factors have contributed to this outperformance, including stronger-than-anticipated U.S. economic growth, the lion's share of the heavy lifting has been done by the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have taken Wall Street to new heights\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are, as the name implies, seven of the largest and most-influential public companies. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThere are two reasons investors have flocked to these seven businesses for years. The first, which I already alluded to, is their outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500. Over the trailing decade, Nvidia's stock is higher by more than 20,000%, Tesla's shares have gained north of 1,100%, and both Amazon and Microsoft are within striking distance of 1,000% gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is higher by a comparatively modest 183%. MSFT Chart\n\nThe second factor that's powered the Magnificent Seven are their undeniable competitive advantages:\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in the cloud, with Azure accounting for a quarter of cloud infrastructure service spending during the September-ended quarter. It's also one of only two public companies to bear the highest credit rating possible (AAA) from Standard & Poor's. Apple is consistently the most-dominant domestic smartphone company by market share. On top of its physical product innovation, it offers the largest share repurchase program of any public company in the U.S. Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) may account for more than a 90% share of GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers this year. Alphabet is something of a jack of all trades. Its internet search engine Google is a veritable monopoly, with a 92% share of worldwide search in February. Alphabet is also the parent of the second most-visited social site (YouTube) and No. 3 global cloud infrastructure service platform (Google Cloud). Amazon, similar to Alphabet, is a key player in multiple categories. Last year, it accounted for close to 38% of U.S. online retail sales. It's also the leading global cloud infrastructure service provider, with Amazon Web Services comprising a 31% share of worldwide spend in the September-ended quarter. Meta Platforms holds the globe's top social media real estate. Facebook is the most-visited social site, and its combination of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads, attracts close to 4 billion monthly active users. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV company that's achieved recurring profitability on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nBut just because the Magnificent Seven have outperformed when looking in the rearview mirror, it doesn't mean their outlooks are the same. As we push into the heart of spring, one Magnificent Seven constituent remains historically inexpensive and ripe for the picking, while another highflier may struggle to meet increasingly loftier investor expectations.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in April: Meta Platforms\n\nAmong the seven industry leaders within the Magnificent Seven, the one that can confidently be purchased hand over fist by investors in April (with the purpose of holding shares for years to come) is social media maven Meta Platforms.\n\nEvery publicly traded company faces headwinds, and Meta is no exception. The biggest concern for investors is simply the health of the U.S. economy. Last year, Meta generated just shy of 98% of its $134.9 billion in sales from advertising. The ad industry tends to be ultra-sensitive to economic headwinds, with businesses paring back their spending at the first hints of trouble. If a select group of money-based metrics and predictive indicators are correct and a U.S. recession materializes, it could spell trouble for Meta.\n\nBut there's another side to this story that's even more important. Though economic downturns are normal and will occur whether we want them to or not, they're historically short-lived. Only three recessions since the end of World War II hit the one-year mark, with none surpassing 18 months. Most periods of growth last for multiple years, which favors ad-based operating models like Meta.\n\nAs noted, Meta Platforms has the most-popular social media sites. Facebook recorded 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) in the December-ended quarter, with 3.98 billion MAUs across the entirety of its platforms. Advertisers understand that no social media company offers broader access to consumers than Meta. As a result, it should boast enviable ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nInvestors are also clearly excited about Meta's AI ambitions. In particular, generative AI solutions give advertisers the ability to tailor their message(s) to individual users. We're witnessing just the tip of the iceberg in terms of AI utility for Meta.\n\nSomething that often gets overlooked about Meta is that it's swimming in cash. While skeptics have been quick to point to its growing losses at Reality Labs (the company's augmented/virtual reality and metaverse division), Meta closed out 2023 with more than $65 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated over $71 billion in cash from operations last year. Its cash pile affords it the luxury of taking risks.\n\nThe cherry on top is that Meta is still historically cheap, even after more-than-quintupling from its 2022 bear market low. Shares are valued at 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents an 11% discount to the company's trailing-five-year cash-flow multiple and is an absolute bargain with earnings slated to grow by an annual average of 26% through 2028.

The highflier that's worth avoiding at all costs in April is megacap outperformer Nvidia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are viable reasons why Nvidia has gained nearly $2 trillion in market cap since the start of 2023. The company's GPUs are nothing short of a go-to for data centers responsible for training large language models and powering generative AI solutions.\n\nSomething else that's unquestionably helped Nvidia's sales has been demand for AI-GPUs swamping supply. During the first-half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), the company's cost of revenue actually declined! Though GPU production began to pick up during the fiscal fourth quarter, much of the company's 217% increase in data center sales last year came from scarcity-driven pricing power.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia's headwinds will soon outnumber its tailwinds.\n\nFor example, Nvidia's expanded production in the current fiscal year has the potential to be its undoing. Normally, increased production would lead to higher gross profit. But don't forget that GPU scarcity is what drove the lion's share of data center sales growth last year. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia meets more of its customers' demands, scarcity will taper and the company's margins should retrace.\n\nAs I pointed out recently, competition is another concern -- but not just from external competitors. The biggest threat to Nvidia's sales may come from its top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet collectively account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales; and they're all developing AI chips for their in-house data centers. These internally developed chips will either complement Nvidia's AI infrastructure and reduce the reliance of these four Magnificent Seven stocks on the AI kingpin, or they could replace Nvidia entirely. Either way, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from its top customers.\n\nRegulators are capping Nvidia's upside, too. In September 2022, regulators banned the export of Nvidia's top-tier A100 and H100 chips to China. Though Nvidia developed toned-down versions of these AI-GPUs, known as the A800 and H800, U.S. regulators also banned the export of these chips in October 2023. Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales because of these restrictions.\n\nLast but not least, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an early stage bubble. Investors have consistently overestimated the adoption of new innovations/technologies for decades, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception. Note, I'm not saying AI and Nvidia can't be wildly successful over the long run. Rather, I'm noting that history suggests Nvidia is in an early stage bubble because AI hasn't matured as a trend. This makes Nvidia a stock worth avoiding in April.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Generally, when new technology is introduced, investment opportunities are speculative and risky. This happened first with personal computers, and now, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. By now, nearly every big tech company has its hands firmly inside the AI cookie jar, with most small and mid-cap companies also following suit. It’s not an overstatement to say that AI has the potential to be the biggest game-changer in technology since the internet itself.\n\nThe best AI investments will provide a platform for other tangential businesses. Not only will they be utilizing AI to better serve their customers, but they will be also building new AI-driven products and services to forever change industry dynamics. Here are our three picks for the best AI stocks to consider for your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s largest companies and owns several dominant brands in the tech industry. These include Google Search, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Currently, the stock’s median price target of $163.12 represents a potential 10% upside from its current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDespite facing a couple of missteps at the start, this big tech company has been one of the first to jump right into the AI waters. Google Bard, for instance, made headlines for producing inaccurate responses that put it a level below ChatGPT. Now though, beyond simply Google Bard, Google has launched AI appliances such as Vertex AI and Project IDX to help websites, workspaces and workflow. As Gemini (a rebranded Bard) slowly becomes the leading generative AI platform integrated into Google’s suite of applications, investors can be optimistic about this company’s strength as one of the AI industry’s leaders.\n\nAlphabet also remains one of the cheapest mega-cap stocks relative to its competitors, trading at just 22.27x forward earnings and 6.25x sales. In terms of earnings, this makes GOOGL cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Alphabet’s strength is also demonstrated by its 14 consecutive quarters of increased revenue and five-year revenue CAGR of 18%. As far as AI and blue-chip tech stocks go for us, GOOGL is a no-brainer.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company most recognized for its flagship products including Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, and Premiere. Yahoo Finance analysts currently give a consensus average price target of about $574.00, 15% higher than today’s closing price.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, you might not immediately think of Adobe. Nonetheless, the company has been leveraging generative AI to give its creative customers some of the most comprehensive artistic tools. These include the Adobe Firefly platform which will drastically grow the scale of deliverable AI-generated branded content for enterprise users and content creators. In fact, one of the early adopters of Adobe Firefly was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which used the platform to create its Dreamworld campaign.\n\nLooking at its financials, we see a stock that trades at roughly a fair value compared to its tech industry peers. However, where Adobe truly stands out is its profitability. Adobe currently has an 88.08% gross margin, over 80% higher than its sector median of 48.62%! With a 10-year net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as well, we see Adobe as a profitability cash cow in the AI space.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American multinational cybersecurity company that was founded in 2011. Yahoo Finance analysts almost all rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a median one-year price target nearly 20% higher than its current price.\n\nThe bull case for Crowdstrike and AI is twofold. The first case is based on its Falcon platform. This platform is trained on trillions of historical security events and utilizes AI and machine learning to identify, detect, and neutralize potential threats. Additionally, Crowdstrike also has a generative AI security analyst named Charlotte that can help users with its diverse range of products. As elevated cybersecurity concerns arise due to the increase in AI used for malicious reasons, we see Crowdstrike as an investment at the forefront of solving these issues.\n\nCRWD has already gained nearly 150% over the past 52 weeks. While its valuation is slightly elevated over its sector mean, we find confidence in its outstanding balance between growth and profitability. For instance, despite growing at a five-year revenue CAGR Of 65%, CRWD has still managed to maintain incredibly strong gross margins of over 75%!\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Target shopper data, streaming TV ads are key to its sales",
        "content": "By Siddharth Cavale\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - While streaming a favorite TV show as her baby naps, an ad for Enfamil NeuroPro infant formula pops on a new mother's screen.\n\nShe whips out her phone to scan the ad's \"quick response\" code. It directs her phone to Target's website to complete the $46.49 purchase.\n\nSales of merchandise at Target stores have fallen for three consecutive quarters as Americans seek bargains at rivals Walmart and direct-to-consumer retailers PDD Group's Temu and Shein.\n\nMinneapolis-based Target projects its comparable sales will be ho-hum - flat to up 2% - this year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Target's retail media unit, a business through which it creates and sells ads, grew more than 20% in its fiscal year ended Feb. 3, Target CEO Brian Cornell said during Target's March 5 analyst day in New York.\n\nOverall, product makers and other advertisers are expected to spend $60 billion total to advertise on U.S. retailers' media networks in 2024, according to estimates from Emarketer, a market research company. From Walmart to Amazon, and from Macy's to Home Depot, more retailers are betting on revenue from advertising.\n\nTarget's ad business, which it calls Roundel, generated $1.5 billion in \"value,\" Target's CEO Cornell said, adding that its ad business benefited Target's gross margins more than its revenue.\n\nWith tech companies like Google tightening their grip on third-party data sharing with advertisers, advertisers are eager to glean insights from retailers like Target, according to representatives from four advertising agencies specializing in consumer goods. Shoppers make more than 250 million visits a year to Target stores and its website.\n\nEnfamil and Apple are both among what Cara Sylvester, chief guest experience officer at Target, said was a pool of 2,600 brands that pay Target to craft product advertisements that reach certain Target shoppers, including on social media and streaming platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, for instance, Apple partnered with Roundel on a holiday campaign for its Apple Watch Series 9, Sylvester said, adding that the campaign attracted a significantly higher number of new shoppers, many from outside of Target's app and website, than Apple's prior campaigns with Target. Apple confirmed it worked with Target on the ad but declined further comment.\n\nAnd when Enfamil maker Reckitt wanted to reach young parents, Target tapped into its own shopper data to identify an audience of likely buyers. It zeroed in on Target shoppers who either bought baby gear over the previous six months, or NeuroPro formula over the previous year. It then tapped its ongoing partnerships with smart-TV device makers such as Roku Streaming Stick and Fire TV stick to display the ad - with a scan-to-buy QR code - to the target buyer group.\n\nNich Weinheimer, executive vice president of strategy at Skai, a marketing agency whose clients include Philips, Kellogg, and Sony, said advertisers see Target as a prime vehicle for reaching new moms and heads of households who buy household products and clothing and accessories.\n\nAccording to Numerator, a research firm that tracks shopper behavior, Target's shoppers are primarily white and female, live in suburban or urban areas, and have a household income between $40,000 and $125,000.\n\nTarget doesn't hand over its individual shopper data to its advertising clients, but rather shares aggregated shopper data without personally identifiable information, a Target spokesperson said.\n\nTarget investor Huntington Private Bank likes Target's profitable ad business, and hopes Target will use the proceeds from advertising sales to lower its prices on the merchandise it sells online and in stores.\n\n\"Getting more and more into the ad opportunity ... is where the real money is,\" said David Klink, a senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds more than $20 million in Target shares.\n\nEnfamil said it spent what it said was a six-figure sum for the advertisement that ran from mid June though the end of July. Target managed the entire campaign, according to a Target case study summarizing the campaign's results.\n\nIn its summary of the Enfamil campaign, Target said 15.8 million shoppers viewed the ad. Target's strategy of marketing the formula to past baby product purchasers delivered a roughly 31% better return on Enfamil's ad spending than if Target had directed the ad only to past NeuroPro purchasers, according to the case study.\n\nEnfamil said it would continue to work with Roundel on more ads in the future. But three advertisers told Reuters that Roundel offers them less control to manage their own ad campaigns compared to rivals such as Amazon and Walmart, both of which operate much bigger retail media units.\n\n\"(Target's media network) Roundel is an important business at Target and we see our curated approach as a key point of difference in helping Roundel drive value,\" said Sarah Travis, president of Roundel, in a statement to Reuters.\n\nTarget launched a new feature in its ad business this year, which gives marketers more control over their campaigns and better access to some of its shopper data and marketplace sellers when the advertisers purchase search ads, she said.

        "title": "FOCUS-Target shopper data, streaming TV ads are key to its sales",
        "content": "By Siddharth Cavale\n\nNEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - While streaming a favorite TV show as her baby naps, an ad for Enfamil NeuroPro infant formula pops on a new mother's screen.\n\nShe whips out her phone to scan the ad's \"quick response\" code. It directs her phone to Target's website to complete the $46.49 purchase.\n\nSales of merchandise at Target stores have fallen for three consecutive quarters as Americans seek bargains at rivals Walmart and direct-to-consumer retailers PDD Group's Temu and Shein.\n\nMinneapolis-based Target projects its comparable sales will be ho-hum - flat to up 2% - this year.\n\nBut Target's retail media unit, a business through which it creates and sells ads, grew more than 20% in its fiscal year ended Feb. 3, Target CEO Brian Cornell said during Target's March 5 analyst day in New York.\n\nOverall, product makers and other advertisers are expected to spend $60 billion total to advertise on U.S. retailers' media networks in 2024, according to estimates from Emarketer, a market research company. From Walmart to Amazon, and from Macy's to Home Depot, more retailers are betting on revenue from advertising.\n\nTarget's ad business, which it calls Roundel, generated $1.5 billion in \"value,\" Target's CEO Cornell said, adding that its ad business benefited Target's gross margins more than its revenue.\n\nWith tech companies like Google tightening their grip on third-party data sharing with advertisers, advertisers are eager to glean insights from retailers like Target, according to representatives from four advertising agencies specializing in consumer goods. Shoppers make more than 250 million visits a year to Target stores and its website.\n\nEnfamil and Apple are both among what Cara Sylvester, chief guest experience officer at Target, said was a pool of 2,600 brands that pay Target to craft product advertisements that reach certain Target shoppers, including on social media and streaming platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, for instance, Apple partnered with Roundel on a holiday campaign for its Apple Watch Series 9, Sylvester said, adding that the campaign attracted a significantly higher number of new shoppers, many from outside of Target's app and website, than Apple's prior campaigns with Target. Apple confirmed it worked with Target on the ad but declined further comment.\n\nAnd when Enfamil maker Reckitt wanted to reach young parents, Target tapped into its own shopper data to identify an audience of likely buyers. It zeroed in on Target shoppers who either bought baby gear over the previous six months, or NeuroPro formula over the previous year. It then tapped its ongoing partnerships with smart-TV device makers such as Roku Streaming Stick and Fire TV stick to display the ad - with a scan-to-buy QR code - to the target buyer group.\n\nNich Weinheimer, executive vice president of strategy at Skai, a marketing agency whose clients include Philips, Kellogg, and Sony, said advertisers see Target as a prime vehicle for reaching new moms and heads of households who buy household products and clothing and accessories.\n\nAccording to Numerator, a research firm that tracks shopper behavior, Target's shoppers are primarily white and female, live in suburban or urban areas, and have a household income between $40,000 and $125,000.\n\nTarget doesn't hand over its individual shopper data to its advertising clients, but rather shares aggregated shopper data without personally identifiable information, a Target spokesperson said.\n\nTarget investor Huntington Private Bank likes Target's profitable ad business, and hopes Target will use the proceeds from advertising sales to lower its prices on the merchandise it sells online and in stores.\n\n\"Getting more and more into the ad opportunity ... is where the real money is,\" said David Klink, a senior equity analyst at Huntington Private Bank, which holds more than $20 million in Target shares.\n\nEnfamil said it spent what it said was a six-figure sum for the advertisement that ran from mid June though the end of July. Target managed the entire campaign, according to a Target case study summarizing the campaign's results. In its summary of the Enfamil campaign, Target said 15.8 million shoppers viewed the ad. Target's strategy of marketing the formula to past baby product purchasers delivered a roughly 31% better return on Enfamil's ad spending than if Target had directed the ad only to past NeuroPro purchasers, according to the case study.\n\nEnfamil said it would continue to work with Roundel on more ads in the future. But three advertisers told Reuters that Roundel offers them less control to manage their own ad campaigns compared to rivals such as Amazon and Walmart, both of which operate much bigger retail media units.\n\n\"(Target's media network) Roundel is an important business at Target and we see our curated approach as a key point of difference in helping Roundel drive value,\" said Sarah Travis, president of Roundel, in a statement to Reuters.\n\nTarget launched a new feature in its ad business this year, which gives marketers more control over their campaigns and better access to some of its shopper data and marketplace sellers when the advertisers purchase search ads, she said. So-called sponsored product ads pop up when shoppers search online using key words like \"best coffee\" or \"men's bodywash.\"\n\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York Editing by Nick Zieminski)",

        "title": "Apple Investors Seek Signs Worst Is Over After Quarterly Slump",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — With Apple Inc.’s stock coming off its poorest quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 Index in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Million Simulations, One Verdict for US Economy: Debt Danger Ahead Trump Media’s Business Doesn’t Matter Iran Vows to Punish Israel Over Deadly Syria Embassy Strike Erdogan Suffers Historic Loss in Turkey Municipal Elections Caribbean Golden Passport Cost Soars to $200,000 on EU Crackdown\n\nThe 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say the stock is flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.\n\n“Nobody wants to sell anymore of their Apple positions because there’s a dividend, big share buybacks and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler & Co. “I don’t see the stock falling much further from here. The bigger risk is that Apple’s stock may be stuck in a range between $165 to $200 until it can decisively break above its longer-term moving averages.”\n\nThe slide has erased more than $300 billion in market value this year, ceding Apple’s status as the most-valuable US company to Microsoft Corp. The drop was spurred by declining sales in China, regulatory scrutiny of its App store, and mounting concern among investors about its growth outlook.\n\nAs the S&P 500 gained, Apple’s return lagged it by 21 percentage points in the first quarter, the worst showing by that measure since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBut the loss has been steep enough that it’s nearing a key support level at $165, the low it hit in October, when the broader market also bottomed out.\n\nApple shares briefly traded for less than $170 at various points in recent sessions. Breaking below that level and holding there could presage a pullback to its October low of $165.67. It ended Monday at $170.03.\n\nStory continues\n\nShort sellers pounced on Apple as peers like Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. kept rallying. Apple is the second-most profitable short position this year at $2.4 billion in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners. That may give them some incentive to unwind the positions, and while the size of open short positions hasn’t changed much, they’re down from levels seen last year.\n\nWith Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that tech shares may face pressure in the coming months — even with Nvidia’s dominance. The stock continues to set new lows relative to the $260 billion Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1, ticker QQQ, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index. That suggests a momentum divergence has formed in the tech sector versus the broader market, with weakness emerging underneath the surface for growth shares.\n\nThat said, Apple traditionally serves as a flight-to-safety trade due to its strong business model and cash generation. Despite challenges in China, Apple’s massive buyback plans mean its shares continue to have upside potential for long-term money managers, according to Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc.\n\nWhile anxiety is building over how long the artificial intelligence euphoria can last following Nvidia’s over 80% surge in 2024, Apple shouldn’t be a drag on the S&P 500 unless it breaks its multi-year uptrend from its 2020 lows, according to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nIf other tech stocks stumble, Piper’s Johnson says it may even spur a rotation back into Apple.\n\n“If traders sell Nvidia, will they buy Apple instead? I hear it constantly from clients,” he said. “Investors love swapping one Magnificent Seven stock for another.”\n\n—With assistance from Elena Popina.\n\n(Updates with Tuesday trading for Apple)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite Wok How Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the Cards Building Diversity When Affirmative Action Is Banned FTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of Crypto Eclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Leading companies that are involved in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have already driven big gains for investors over the last year, but it's not too late for investors to capitalize. Almost every industry will eventually benefit from the increases in productivity that AI brings, and investors are just seeing a tiny bit of what this technology will do for businesses and consumers in the decades to come.\n\nLet's look at two leaders in semiconductors and consumer technology that are well positioned to benefit and reward shareholders.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has been making chips for many years for video game consoles and personal computers. But AMD's data center business is starting to warm up after a sluggish year. It recently launched new graphics processing units (GPUs) designed for AI that could deliver significant growth.\n\nAMD is working with leading cloud customers, including Microsoft and Oracle, to deploy its new MI300 family of GPUs for AI workloads. Data center GPU revenue exceeded management's expectations of $400 million in the fourth quarter, and is expected to reach $3.5 billion for the full year in fiscal 2024 -- and will likely grow into a major business on its own in the years to come.\n\nAnother growth catalyst for AMD is a recovering PC market. AMD's client segment, including sales of Ryzen processors, generated 21% of its revenue last year, but segment revenue fell last year with an industry-wide decline in PC shipments. Ryzen powers more than 90% of AI-based PCs, which puts AMD is in a great position to capitalize on growing demand as this technology gains more widespread adoption.\n\nThe stock has already climbed 88% over the last year, but its valuation still leaves room for more upside. Data center GPUs generate high margins that can drive high earnings growth to deliver market-beating returns for investors.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) uses AI extensively across its products and iOS software. It is an essential technology that powers certain features in the camera, image recognition, and Siri services. While Apple is facing near-term headwinds with weak revenue in China and an antitrust lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice, the company's investments in AI position it well for long-term growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe next iteration of the iPhone is rumored to include Apple's next-generation chips, which will boost performance for generative AI features. The iPhone 15 has seen solid growth in sales despite weakness in China, with revenue up 6% year over year in the December-ending quarter. Management credited a record number of people upgrading for the increase. As Apple starts putting more AI features into these phones, it could drive an even stronger sales cycle.\n\nA generative-AI powered iPhone could let users ask Siri to summarize documents, for example, or complete other common tasks. It would also give Apple a great sales pitch for its more expensive iPhone Pro models, where these AI features would likely get implemented first. This could drive up average selling prices for iPhones and lead to strong earnings growth.\n\nWall Street analysts currently expect Apple to grow earnings by 9% on an annualized basis, but strong demand for AI-enabled iPhones could lead to better growth than what's implied in the stock's valuation. At the least, the stock could slightly outperform the broader market over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "When You Look Back in 5 Years, You'll Wish You'd Bought This Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began as an online bookseller when it was founded in 1994. E-commerce remains the company's largest source of revenue, but it has also expanded into other areas of the technology sector, including cloud computing, streaming, digital advertising, and now artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI could be one of the greatest financial opportunities in history, and Amazon is tackling it from multiple angles. The company just made the final payment of its agreed $4 billion investment into leading AI start-up Anthropic, a deal that will accelerate Amazon's progress on both the hardware and software sides.\n\nAmazon is one of six companies valued at $1 trillion or more, and all of its peers have a presence in AI. However, Amazon generates more revenue than all of them, and yet its stock is the cheapest of the bunch. Here's why investors might regret not buying it when they look back on this moment in five years.\n\nAmazon is cementing itself as a leader in artificial intelligence\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services platform in the world. It offers hundreds of solutions to help businesses store data, operate digital sales channels, develop software, and build AI applications. Amazon's goal is to have AWS dominate the three primary layers of AI.\n\nThe hardware layer comes first. Like most cloud providers, Amazon fills its data centers with Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most powerful in the industry when it comes to handling AI workloads.\n\nHowever, Amazon also designs its own chips; it recently launched Trainium2, which is four times faster and twice as energy efficient as the original Trainium chip, allowing developers to train large language models (LLMs) far more quickly. LLMs sit at the foundation of popular consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT.\n\nBut some developers prefer to use existing LLMs so they can build AI applications more quickly. That's the second layer. AWS offers a variety of models, including its own called Titan and models from leading third parties like Anthropic, Meta Platforms, and Stability AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nReady-made applications are the third and final layer. AWS offers CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their programming. Then there is Amazon Q, a fully functional chatbot embedded in AWS. No two businesses are the same, so Q can be tailored to suit the tasks at hand to streamline projects, drive innovation, and speed up decision making. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Amazon-Anthropic deal will accelerate progress on all fronts\n\nIn September 2023, Amazon and Anthropic announced a strategic partnership. Amazon would invest $4 billion in the start-up, of which the final $2.75 billion was transferred in March to close the deal. In exchange, Anthropic is helping Amazon accelerate penetration into the AI industry.\n\nAnthropic is the creator of Claude, a generative AI chatbot. Its recent Claude 3 models reportedly outperformed competitors like OpenAI's GTP-4 models in most multimodal benchmarks. That means they are better at reasoning, solving math problems, answering complex questions, and generating content like computer code.\n\nAnthropic will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also train its future AI models on Amazon's chips, which could entice other leading developers to use them instead of Nvidia's hardware, which have become the default choice. Finally, Anthropic will make all of its models available on AWS for customers to use, which could be an advantage when developers are choosing a cloud provider.\n\nMicrosoft is the world's second-largest cloud provider, and it invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year. If Anthropic's Claude continues to outperform GPT-4, it could give Amazon and AWS the ultimate edge in the AI race.\n\nAmazon is the cheapest trillion-dollar stock by this metric\n\nAmazon generated $574 billion in revenue in 2023, which was more than any of its trillion-dollar peers. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was the closest with $394 billion in sales during its fiscal 2023 year (ended Sept. 30, 2023).\n\nNevertheless, Amazon's market capitalization stands at $1.9 trillion, compared to Apple's $2.7 trillion. The price to sales (P/S) ratio divides a company's market cap by its annual revenue, so in this case Amazon's P/S ratio is 3.2.\n\nAs the below chart shows, Amazon stock is substantially cheaper than those of all of its trillion-dollar peers in the tech sector on a P/S basis, which includes Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google). NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's revenue grew by 12% in 2023, which was a faster rate of growth than Apple (2.8%) and Alphabet (9%), yet its stock trades at half their P/S ratio. Amazon generates less profit (relative to its revenue) because its e-commerce business operates on razor-thin margins, which is a key reason investors give it a lower valuation.\n\nHowever, AWS specifically is highly profitable, with $24.6 billion in operating income on $90.7 billion in revenue last year. Here's the kicker: Most Wall Street forecasts suggest AI will have a multitrillion-dollar impact on the global economy. Plus, Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management believes AI software companies will generate $14 trillion in revenue by 2030.\n\nTherefore, AWS might be sitting on significant untapped potential. As it grows to become a larger contributor to Amazon's overall revenue, it will make the entire organization more profitable. When investors look back on this moment in a handful of years, they might be glad they bought Amazon stock at its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Eli Lilly and Company LLY, American Tower Corp. AMT and McKesson Corp. MCK.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Apple, NVIDIA and Eli Lilly\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., NVIDIA Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock down -11.9% in the year-to-date period compared to +11.4% gain for the Zacks Tech sector and the +10.1% gain for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe company is benefiting from steady iPhone sales amid stiff competition and weakness in China. Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the December-end quarter.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $170.03, denoting a -0.85% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.2%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 0.6%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.11%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has dropped by 4.55% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.99% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.32%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.50, reflecting a 1.32% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $90.38 billion, down 4.7% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.55 per share and a revenue of $385.52 billion, signifying shifts of +6.85% and +0.58%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% higher. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 26.19. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.06 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that AAPL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Mini computers industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.53 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 237, which puts it in the bottom 6% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple expects the March quarter’s revenues and iPhone revenues to be similar to that of the year-ago quarter’s figure after removing the additional $5 billion it generated due to pent-up demand for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro Max in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2% on a year-over-year basis.

However, rising input costs concern the Zacks analyst.\n\nSteady Demand Buoys American Tower (AMT), Debt Woes Linger\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, American Tower is witnessing steady demand at its towers due to a surge in wireless services usage. Yet, a substantially leveraged balance sheet may impede cash-flow generation.\n\nDemand for Specialty Products Driving McKesson (MCK) Prospects\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, McKesson's distribution segment will continue to benefit from higher volume of specialty products coupled with price rise. Rising demand for extended and primary care buoys well\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) Strong on Dividends Amid Volume Woes\r\nThe Zacks analyst likes the company's efforts to reward its shareholders. However, below-par volumes due to the weak freight demand scenario remain a concern.\n\nInvestments to Benefit Entergy (ETR), Poor Financials Woe\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Entergy's solid investments are expected to boost its grid upgrades and customer reliability. Yet its deteriorating financial ratios implies its poor financial position.\n\nOnto Innovation (ONTO) Benefits From Solid Product Portfolio\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, Onto Innovation's performance benefits from increasing demand for the Dragonfly inspection system. However, stiff competition is a major headwind.\n\nSolid Revenue Growth & Buyouts Aid Encompass Health (EHC)\r\nPer the Zacks Analyst, Encompass Health's top line has been fueled by growing patient volumes.

        "content": "When it comes to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta(NASDAQ: META), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which one is not like the others? They are all iconic tech companies, sure. But only one of these stocks is actually down year to date (YTD) while the markets regularly breach all-time highs -- Apple.\n\nApple stock is down nearly 12% this year and down 14% from all-time highs, and sentiment appears negative. As shown below, its underperformance against the above high-flyers is even more pronounced over the past year. AAPL data by YCharts.\n\nApple has several challenges, such as a struggling consumer economy in China and a challenge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. But make no mistake, Apple is still a powerhouse, and the stock may be on sale soon.\n\nWhy is Apple stock down?\n\nApple has endured several challenges recently. The pandemic-era stimulus was a massive boon for consumer electronics, but that stimulus dried up just as inflation started eating into people's budgets. Investors are also focused elsewhere, mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) (just look at the AI stocks in the chart above!), where Apple is a minor player. But the biggest reason is China.\n\nChina accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue in fiscal 2023 and 20% of its operating income. The Chinese economy has struggled much more than the U.S.'s, and Chinese competitors like Huawei are taking market share. Reports are that iPhone sales in China are down 33% in February over last year. This is a hurdle, but buying stock in a terrific company when it is down is typically the best money-making strategy over the long haul.\n\nNow that we know some of the challenges, let's look at the other side.\n\nIs Apple stock a buy now?\n\nHere are three reasons for optimism:\n\nConsumer strength Services Return of capital.\n\nWhile iPhone sales are slipping in China, they were up 6% overall last quarter, which was Apple's fiscal first quarter. Total revenue rose just 2%; however, operating income rose 12% -- a sign that margin pressures from inflation are easing. The U.S. consumer is resilient, and consumer sentiment is as high as it has been in nearly three years. The recession many feared is in doubt. Apple is too big to be a high-growth name now, but profits should remain robust.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother reason for Apple's significant increase in operating income is its burgeoning Services segment, which has grown exponentially, as shown below.

Last quarter, these sales accounted for 19% of Apple's revenue and had a gross margin of 73%, compared to 39% for product sales. This means that Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream is also its most profitable.\n\nApple is a cash cow that generously rewards shareholders. Last quarter, it generated $40 billion in cash from operations and returned $27 billion to shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. Since fiscal 2020, $432 billion has been returned, amounting to 16% of the total market cap today.\n\nApple uses more cash for buybacks than dividends. Some say the dividend yield, which is under 1%, isn't attractive, but I prefer buybacks. Share buybacks are advantageous because investors aren't taxed on them each year. Instead, they reduce Apple's share count, which raises earnings per share (EPS), and the stock price rises as a result. Apple has nearly doubled the total return of the SPDR S&P 500 Trust since 2020.\n\nLastly, I would be remiss not to mention the recently released Apple Vision Pro. This latest foray into wearables allows users to use apps, browse the net, take and view photos and videos in 3D, and play games on a screen as big or small as the user desires by \"bridging the physical and digital space.\" This tech is way over my head, but it is pretty incredible, gives Apple another revenue stream, and is a testament to innovation.\n\nApple stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7, just under its three-year and five-year averages.So, interested investors don't need to rush to accumulate shares. Instead, address Apple's current negative sentiment by buying slowly over time to take advantage of price dips. Many will tell you that staying committed in the long run is rewarding once you own the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Biden DOJ takes aim at Apple even though consumers love it",
        "content": "Apparently, nothing irritates the Biden administration more than a successful business. Apple is the latest target of the Justice Department’s ongoing crackdown on what they say are high-tech monopolies.\n\nThe DOJ has already filed actions against Amazon, Google and Meta platforms. This time they, along with 15 state attorneys general and Washington D.C., allege in a suit filed in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey that Apple’s policies hurt consumers and competitors.\n\nThey contend the company deliberately makes it harder for users to switch to non-Apple devices and prevents competitors from offering alternatives to its services, such as digital wallets. The allegations concern not only smartphones but also web browsers, advertising services and more.\n\nDOJ SUES APPLE IN ANTITRUST CASE, ALLEGING ILLEGAL SMARTPHONE MARKET MONOPOLY\n\nApple fiercely denies the charges and vows it will \"vigorously defend\" against them. And a lot of people think they have solid ground to stand on. Apple is one of America's most-popular companies. But that doesn't stop government from going after it. FILE: The Apple Inc. logo at one of the company's stores in Sydney, Australia, on Friday, March 18, 2022.\n\nFor one thing, Apple’s iPhone has just 57% of the U.S. smartphone market. Globally, it’s only about 20%. That’s hardly a monopoly. Android serves 41% of U.S. phone users, which clearly indicates that people who prefer not to use Apple’s devices are able to easily find an alternative product. Again, that does not fit the definition of a monopoly.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nWhat the DOJ, politicized by President Joe Biden’s campaign strategy to \"go after\" Big Tech, fails to realize that people choose to use iPhones, or buy other Apple merchandise, simply because they like them.\n\nApple is one of America’s favorite companies. It doesn’t sell a lot of phones by forcing them on consumers, it simply makes a good product.\n\nApple has been one of the world’s great innovators for almost 50 years. Started in a California garage in the 1970s, Apple now holds 95,500 patents and continues to file thousands of new ones each year. Putting the government in charge of how Apple designs and develops its products would put the brakes on one of the strongest economic engines in the U.S. economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nTalking to CNBC, an Apple spokesperson said: \"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThat’s a pretty legitimate argument. It indeed would be a dangerous precedent to weaponize the DOJ to bring down a U.S. company that meets the needs of consumers, employs thousands of workers and generates significant tax revenues at every level of government. Why would the government want to do that?\n\nThe intensely competitive tech market, where companies continually work to develop better products, services and technologies, is much more capable than the Biden administration of deciding Apple’s future. Keep the DOJ out of it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY STEVE FORBES\n\nSteve Forbes is Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Media.

        "title": "Here's the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy in April, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "\"April showers bring May flowers.\" But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks? Maybe so.\n\nYou might not think the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have much more room to run after delivering sizzling gains. However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here's the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.\n\nCrossing names off the list\n\nWe can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.\n\nFor example, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential.\n\nIt's a similar story for Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price.\n\nWall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%.\n\nThe \"A team\"\n\nThat leaves the \"A team\" as the top contenders: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street's favorite right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher. Analysts think the e-commerce and cloud services leader could have more room to run with the consensus price target nearly 7% above the current share price.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet is our runner-up. After the stock's strong gain of almost 50% over the last 12 months, Wall Street thinks it can rise another 8%.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, analysts view Apple as the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April. The average 12-month price target for the iPhone maker is more than 8% above the current share price, reflecting a slightly higher upside potential than Wall Street sees for Alphabet.\n\nApple's stock performance over the last 12 months has lagged well behind every Magnificent Seven stock except Tesla. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023.\n\nIs Wall Street right about Apple?\n\nI'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst.\n\nBut Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is \"investing significantly\" in generative AI because of its \"incredible breakthrough potential.\" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.\n\nIt's possible that Apple won't reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn't meet expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the company delivers the \"wow\" that it's been lacking for a while. Maybe, just maybe, this Magnificent Seven stock will soon become more magnificent.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.
